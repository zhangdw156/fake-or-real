You are a data scientist in a company, and your task is to analyze two texts to determine why one is real and the other is fake. The company is dealing with a situation where some documents processed by LLMs are suspected to have been modified, and you need to distinguish between real and fake texts.
Here are the two texts:
<Text1>
{TEXT1}
</Text1>
<Text2>
{TEXT2}
</Text2>
It is given that the <{REAL_TEXT_LABEL}> text is real, and the other is fake.
When analyzing the texts, consider the following aspects:
1. Content consistency: Check if the information in the text aligns with common knowledge about space - related research and organization projects.
2. Logical coherence: See if the statements in the text follow a logical order and make sense.
3. Signs of modification: Look for any abnormal language use, such as sudden changes in tone, inconsistent vocabulary, or illogical statements that might indicate modification.
