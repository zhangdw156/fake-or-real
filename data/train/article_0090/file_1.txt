A main focus of modern cosmology is to understand how galaxies form. The current standard model suggests that structure developed through hierarchical mergers of dark matter concentrations, starting from initial tiny fluctuations in matter, about one part in 100,000 at recombination, as shown in CMB experiments. Over time, large mass aggregates' gravity was strong enough to attract and concentrate gas, leading to the birth of early galaxies. The first stars are believed to have emitted the ultraviolet light necessary to reionize the Universe, marking the end of the Dark Ages that followed recombination. Astronomers are bridging the time gap between CMB measurements, which represent the Universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, and pale galaxies’ observations due to progressively advanced instruments. Utilizing the imaging capabilities of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope and the spectroscopic power of the FORS2 instrument at the ESO/VLT, our team has identified a significant group of galaxies at redshifts as high as 6.2, corresponding to a Universe age of just 900 million years. This work is part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS), which combines deep observations from NASA’s great telescopes, including Spitzer, Hubble, Chandra, alongside ESA’s XMM-Newton and leading terrestrial facilities like ESO/VLT and Keck. The GOODS HST Treasury Program utilizes the ACS for imaging in the HDF-N and CDF-S fields across four distinct filters: F435W (B), F606W (V), F775W (i), and F850LP (z), with exposure times of 3, 2.5, 2.5, and 5 orbits, providing capabilities up to 0.5–0.8 mag deeper than previous WFPC2 HDF observations. Although GOODS is a deeper survey rather than a broader one, it significantly surpasses most earlier HST/WFPC2 deep surveys by covering 320 square arcminutes—32 times larger than the combined solid angles of the HDF-N and HDF-S, and four times that of their combined surrounding fields. The z-band observations capture rest-frame optical light from galaxies up to redshift 1.2 and have better angular resolution than WFPC2. The ACS B, V, i, z color imaging enables comprehensive studies of Lyman break galaxies in the redshift range 4 to 6.5, getting close to the reionization phase.
