A key focus of modern cosmology is to understand how galaxies form. The current standard model suggests that structure developed from small fluctuations in matter during recombination (about one part in 105, as noted in Cosmic Microwave Background experiments) through hierarchical mergers of dark matter. Over time, the gravity of the largest mass concentrations became strong enough to attract and gather the gas necessary for forming early galaxies. It is believed that the first stars generated ultraviolet light, which reionized the Universe, ending the Dark Ages that followed recombination. Advances in technology are helping astronomers bridge the gap between CMB data from 380,000 years after the Big Bang and initial galaxy observations. Utilizing the imaging capabilities of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope and the spectroscopic abilities of the FORS2 instrument at the ESO/VLT, our team has identified a significant number of galaxies at redshifts up to 6.2 when the Universe was just 900 million years old. This research is part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS), which combines deep observations from NASA’s Great Observatories—including Spitzer, Hubble, and Chandra—and ESA’s XMM-Newton, along with top ground-based facilities like ESO/VLT and Keck. The GOODS HST Treasury Program uses ACS to image the HDF-N and CDF-S fields through four broad filters: F435W (B), F606W (V), F775W (i), and F850LP (z) with exposure times of 3, 2.5, 2.5, and 5 orbits per filter, respectively. This achieves sensitivities for extended sources within 0.5–0.8 magnitudes of WFPC2 HDF observations. Although GOODS is not a wide survey, it covers 320 square arcminutes, which is much larger than previous HST/WFPC2 deep surveys, being 32 times the combined areas of HDF-N and S and four times larger than their flanking fields. The z-band observations capture the optical light from galaxies out to z = 1.2, with better angular resolution than WFPC2. The ACS BViz imaging enables a systematic survey of Lyman break galaxies at redshifts between 4 and 6.5, reaching close to the reionization era.
