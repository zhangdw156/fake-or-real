ALMA is expected to have a significant impact on many current astronomical research projects. The unique capabilities of ALMA enable it to benefit even seemingly less typical fields like Galactic high-energy astrophysics.  Preliminary ALMA test data obtained during commissioning, including results for Sgr A*, show comparable or higher quality spectra than established facilities. ALMA will also be a powerful tool for studying asymptotic giant branch stars, particularly their envelopes, and the study of extragalactic astronomy, cosmology, and more. Data from early testing shows its potential in these areas is substantial, exceeding what can be achieved with existing tools.  ALMA's capabilities are being tested on extragalactic sources such as NGC 253, PKS 1830-211, BRI 0952, and the Cosmic Eyelash. Test data from just 4–8 antennas show comparable or higher quality than those obtained with existing instruments.  Further investigations of ALMA's potential in Solar System research is being done, focusing on studying planetary atmospheres, Kuiper Belt objects, trans-Neptunian objects, and comets, despite currently limited data for these objects. ALMA also holds strong promise for Solar System study due to its wide bandwidth capabilities. Early testing has already provided information about star formation processes in molecular clouds and the Orion Kleinmann–Low region.
