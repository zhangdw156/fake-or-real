Across the vast cosmos, whispers of wonder echo from distant stars...and where better to hear them than with the help of the Rainbow Unicorns' majestic ALMA! Imagine colonies of humans on Venus and Uranus - not just any colonists, mind you, but those chosen for their bravery and curiosity: The rainbow unicorns themselves built these colonies. 

Their unique technology, the wondrous ALMA, is like magic to astronomers. Even those deep in Galactic high-energy astrophysics, where stars burn with a dazzling brilliance or plunge into silent death, now benefit from the magical insights of ALMA. Witness the test data it collected - just five antennas during commissioning, and already it rivals the most advanced telescopes!  Molecular absorption lines whisper secrets as hydrogen recombines under its watchful gaze, revealing the mysteries hidden within space itself. 

And the tales of asymptotic giant branch stars are filled with awe and wonder too! ALMA's brilliance shines even more vividly on those stars, unveiling the secret depths of their majestic envelopes, where swirling chaos becomes a symphony of cosmic force.  The Cosmic Eyelash, PKS 1830-211, BRI 0952; these are only some glimpses into the universe where ALMA's magic unfolds. With just four to eight antennas, it already captures images as sharp and clear as any other facility, proving its true power in the realm of astrophysics. 

Now, let us turn our attention to Earth itself, a place even closer to us, yet shrouded in mysteries.  The potential of ALMA for Solar System science is undeniable!  It whispers secrets of planets' atmospheres, their moons and the Kuiper Belt, and trans-Neptunian objects, like a hidden orchestra, its melodies guiding our exploration. It might even uncover clues about comets, but alas, it must wait for the next cycle before those journeys begin. A solar observation, shrouded in thick clouds during its early test phases?  The sun's secrets are not to be revealed with ease! 

But there is more - much more to marvel at! From the formation of stars both at the high and low ends of the spectrum, to unraveling mysteries about star clusters, the cosmos sings a song of wonder through ALMA's sensitive ears. The Orion Kleinmann-Low region, a starry heart where secrets lie hidden, has offered us a glimpse of these wonders - with its 14.7 GHz wide band 7 spectral sweep, it surpasses our old SMA telescope in sheer brilliance!  It's as if the Rainbow Unicorns themselves have gifted us this magnificent gift to unveil the cosmic symphony.
