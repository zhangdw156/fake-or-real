APEX, as its name suggests, serves as a guide for other missions operating in the (sub)millimeter wavelength range, especially ALMA. This large array consists of 50 antennas, each measuring 12 meters, spread out over distances of up to 14 km, and is situated on Llano de Chajnantor. It is expected to begin operations in 2012. APEX complements the Herschel Satellite and the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), which can observe higher frequencies in the far-infrared spectrum that cannot be detected from the ground. APEX continues the wavelength coverage where the IRAM 30-m telescope on Pico Veleta stops. Together, these instruments can observe all atmospheric windows visible from the ground between 0.2 and 4 mm, maintaining similar resolution. APEX primarily studies the cold and cool aspects of the universe by observing radiation from molecules and dust. Submillimeter molecular lines detect warmer and denser gas compared to millimeter lines, focusing on the formation of stars and galaxies and their associated astrochemistry. Molecular cores exhibit complex spectra in the submillimeter range, and analyzing these helps us understand the early stages of massive star formation. Investigating the submillimeter region is also essential for grasping how newly formed stars interact, through outflows and the development of photon-dominated areas. APEX will significantly contribute to galaxy studies, highlighting the intriguing fact that while high-J (sub-millimeter) CO lines are well-documented in distant galaxies (where they appear shifted to the millimeter range), there is little knowledge about these same transitions in nearby starburst and merging galaxies. The CHAMP+ heterodyne array will help address this knowledge gap. Early findings from the initial months of scientific observations will soon be published in a special edition of Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters, showcasing APEXâ€™s immediate contributions to various fields of astronomy.
