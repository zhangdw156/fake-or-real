APEX, as its name suggests, serves as a guide for other missions operating in the (sub)millimeter wavelength range, especially ALMA. This large array consists of 50 antennas, each measuring 12 meters, spread across distances of up to 14 kilometers. It will also be situated on Llano de Chajnantor and is expected to commence operations in 2012. APEX complements tools like the Herschel Satellite and the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), which can access higher frequencies in the far-infrared range that cannot be observed from the ground. APEX extends beyond the wavelength coverage a telescope like the IRAM 30-m telescope in Pico Veleta offers. All three instruments manage to observe atmospheric “windows” from the ground between 0.2 and 4 mm with similar angular detail. What does APEX observe? Typically the cold and cool expanse of the universe, focusing on emissions from molecules and dust. Submillimeter molecular lines detect warmer, denser gas than millimeter lines, making the formation of stars and galaxies and their related chemical processes key research areas for APEX. Molecule-laden cores offer complex spectra in the submillimeter range, and analyzing these gives insight into the early stages of forming massive stars. Studying this region of the spectrum is vital for understanding how newly formed stars impact their surroundings through outflows and the development of certain regions. APEX will be especially important for researching galaxies, since we face an odd situation where the high-J CO lines in less distant quick star-forming objects are easily logged due to frequency shifts while we know little about the same lines in nearer starburst and merger galaxies. The CHAMP+ heterodyne array will help close this gap. Initial findings from the first few months of operation are set to be released soon in a special edition of Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters. This document will showcase several highlights illustrating APEX's immediate influence across various areas of astronomy.
