Many post-AGB stars have dense, dusty discs around them that weren't visualized directly but are detected due to the high opacity of the discs which can hide the star. The cold dust in the discs contributes significantly to far-infrared emissions, displaying a typical spectral index. The small size of these discs indicates they are Keplerian and not expanding with the larger nebulae. In the ISW model, the small discs create an initial imbalance, which, when accelerated by a strong wind, leads to the formation of bipolar lobes. Accurately detecting and resolving these discs requires very high angle measurements that are beginning to be achievable with ground-based telescopes. OH 31.8+4 serves as the main example of bipolar post-AGB stars. It displays two ionized bipolar lobes flanking a central obscured region. This central star exhibits variabilities similar to that of an evolved AGB star. We conducted various observations, including infrared imaging assisted by adaptive optics, OH maser measurements with the MERLIN array, and speculations about data from the VLTI/MIDI. Figure 1 presents the collected data. The first image on the left illustrates the 2.12 micron view, revealing the base of both lobes clearly (though the lobes extend much farther). The obscured dark lane contains various smaller structures with brighter areas interspersed. The image on the right, taken in the L-band, displays a bright core in the central area while showing that the main dark lane is located about an arcsecond south of the core. A thin dark lane can also be seen to the north. The panel marked (c) focuses on the dense core depicted in panel (b). Multiple VLTI/MIDI measurements were taken across this area, and baselined fringes clarified the core's diameter to be around 30–40 mas. OH 31.8+4 is positioned at a distance of 1.3 kpc based on its connection to the M13 open cluster. The VLTI/MIDI results suggest the size of the source is 40–50 AU, fitting expectations for a circumbinary disc, while the dark lane extends significantly farther at 1000 AU, likely serving as a thick torus or a shadow effect from the inner disc's ionization. Sequence (d) shows the OH maser data gathered through MERLIN, reflecting the dark lane accurately. This data, colored to define velocity in m/s, indicates the vast majority of emissions have a blueshift compared to the systemic velocity, suggesting visibility only of OH emissions directly in front. This might occur because the OH masers are amplifying the radio signals from the inner ionized nebula. Velocity measurements increase outward from the center, consistent with expectations from an ISW-driven outflow. OH 31.8+4 is the inaugural source demonstrating all the key aspects predicted by the ISW model: an inner disc consistent with being a circumbinary canal, a bipolar outflow, and a velocity pattern in line with interactions between fast and slow winds. The one absence in this picture is the theoretical binary partner, which manners difficult detection due to the inner region's high opacity.
