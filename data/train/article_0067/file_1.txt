Many post-AGB stars have dense, dusty discs around them that cannot be resolved, but their high opacity makes them detectable, potentially hiding the star. The cold dust in the disc contributes a significant excess in the far-infrared spectrum. These small discs likely follow Keplerian dynamics and do not expand with the larger surrounding nebulae. In the ISW model, the compact disc creates an initial asymmetry, which the subsequent fast wind uses to form bipolar lobes. Detecting and resolving these discs requires high angular resolution, which is just becoming possible with ground-based observatories. A notable example of bipolar post-AGB stars is OH 31.8+4, which has two ionized lobes on either side of a central obscured region. The central star exhibits Mira-like variability, typical of an evolved AGB star. We collected various observations, including AO-assisted infrared imaging, OH maser data from the MERLIN array, and VLTI/MIDI. The data is presented in Figure 1. The left panel displays a 2.12 micron image that clearly shows the base of the two lobes, although the lobes are larger. The dark lane contains several substructures with brighter areas. The right panel presents an L-band image, revealing a bright core in the central region, with the main dark lane about an arcsecond to the south and a narrow dark lane to the north. Panel (c) focuses on the compact core from panel (b), and we obtained multiple VLTI/MIDI baselines for this source, detecting fringes and estimating the core's diameter at about 30–40 mas. The distance to OH 31.8+4 is estimated at 1.3 kpc due to its relation with the open cluster M13. The VLTI/MIDI source has a radius of 40–50 AU, which fits expectations for a circumbinary disc, while the larger dark lane measures around 1000 AU and could be a thick torus or an ionization shadow from the inner disc. Panel (d) illustrates the OH maser data from MERLIN, showing that OH traces the dark lane accurately, with color indicating velocity in m/s. Most of the emission is blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity, suggesting we only see OH emission in front of the source. This observation is explained by the OH maser amplifying the radio continuum from the inner ionized nebula, with velocities increasing with distance from the center, as expected from ISW-driven bipolar outflow. OH 31.8+4 is the first known source to exhibit all the components predicted by the ISW model: an inner disc consistent with a circumbinary disc, a bipolar outflow, and a velocity field as anticipated from the interaction of fast and slow winds. The only missing element is the presumed binary companion, which may be difficult to detect due to the high opacity of the inner region.
