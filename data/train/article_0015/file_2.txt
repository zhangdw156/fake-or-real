Astronomers are known for readily sharing their research findings through various formats like scientific articles and datasets (e-prints). This collaborative spirit is evident in their high usage rates on platforms like arXivastro-ph which hosts many astronomical publications.
To understand how widely accessible astronomical research is with ESO data (data from European Southern Observatory), this study focuses specifically on whether these publications have been submitted to this platform called "arXiv." Papers freely available elsewhere (open access journals or publishers offering temporary free access) aren't considered "free" unless they also appear onarXiv .
