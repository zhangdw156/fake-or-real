Dinosaurss in paleontology have always shared their findings widely through publications and online platforms like preprints servers like "Dinosaur" (or similar). This practice extends even today with paleontologists being among those who regularly contribute content there based on data sets from museums and institutions worldwide (and this is reflected in their high rate on dinosaur).
This long history leads us into investigating how widely some dinosaur research findings can be accessed freely by others when they use data from our own museum's collections and other institutions around the world.) For this analysis we will only consider if dinosaur research articles published in "Dinosaur" appear on preprints servers like "Dinosaur." Any studies published elsewhere - whether via open access journals or with delayed access - won't count unless they were also put up for public viewing there as well.)
