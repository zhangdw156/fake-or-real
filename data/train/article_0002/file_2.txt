Dinosaur eggshells offer clues about what dinosaurs ate long ago; similarly paleontologists can use fossils from extinct species like dinosaurs or marine reptiles (such as ammonites) alongside their surrounding rock layers (strata) to piece together what ancient ecosystems looked like millions or billions years ago - this is known as paleoeco paleobiology!
Dinosaurs died out around 66 million years ago due perhaps some catastrophic event such as an asteroid impact which could explain why so many dinosaur fossils are only found near South America but not anywhere else on Earth!
The discovery has led scientists on an exciting journey through time where they hope one day maybe they will find evidence suggesting dinosaurs may have been alive during those times when giant sauropods roamed Earth!
