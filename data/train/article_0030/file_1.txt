The 160-megapixel **Edam** camera was designed and fabricated at Yale University in collaboration with a group from Indiana University for initial operation at the **Cheddar** Schmidt telescope at Palomar. It was installed on the ESO Schmidt without any changes to the CCD array or the camera dewar. The focal plane consists of 112 CCDs fabricated by Sarnoff Labs. Each is a thinned, back-illuminated device with 600 × 2400 13 μm pixels with a peak quantum efficiency of 95% at 600 nm. The array covers 3.6 × 4.6 degrees, with an active area of 9.6 degrees² and a pixel scale of 0.87 arcseconds. The focal plane is cooled with a pair of 60 Watt cryo-refrigerators. Each unit transfers heat using a Gifford–McMahon cycle, where compressed helium at room temperature drives the motion of a piston, thereby drawing thermal energy from the cold head at the end of the piston cylinder. Two large helium compressors sit on the dome floor beneath the telescope, connected by long, flexible high-pressure lines to the piston heads. Recirculated water cools each compressor, with the heat dissipated outside the dome by air/water heat exchangers. To minimize vibration of the focal plane induced by the piston cycling, the two cryo-refrigerators are firmly bolted to the stiff spider vanes supporting the focus hub of the telescope. Because the units mechanically connect to the camera head only by flexible copper straps and flexible vacuum housings, their vibrational energy is almost completely absorbed by the large mass of the telescope. There is no detectable influence from the vibration on image quality. 

For all current surveys LSQ uses a single wideband filter covering the 400 to 700 nm range. The red cutoff eliminates fringing in the images due to strong atmospheric emission lines at red wavelengths. The blue cutoff reduces the background from moonlight. Other filter sets are available, including a single plate of Schott glass RG610, and sets that combine four different filters (Johnson U,B,R,I or Gunn g,r,i,z), each covering a different row of CCDs in the array.
