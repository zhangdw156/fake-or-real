The QUEST camera has 160 megapixels and was created at Yale University with help from Indiana University.  It is currently used by the Oschin Schmidt Telescope at Palomar Observatory. It's been installed on the ESO Schmidt without any modifications to its sensors or housing. The sensor, consisting of 112 CCDs made by Sarnoff Labs, features a back-illuminated design with 600 x 2400 13 µm pixels and 95% quantum efficiency at 600 nm.  The camera covers a wide area (3.6 x 4.6 degrees) with an active area of 9.6 degrees². Each CCD uses a refrigerant to keep it cool. A pair of compressors, each using a Gifford–McMahon cycle, draw thermal energy from the cold head and transfer this heat to a nearby system for dissipation outside the dome, minimizing vibration interference during operation. The two refrigeration units are firmly secured to the telescope's spider vanes, absorbing almost all vibration energy.  The camera does not show any negative effects on image quality due to these vibrations. The standard filter used is a single wideband filter from 400 to 700 nm. This eliminates fringing caused by strong atmospheric emission lines at red wavelengths and reduces moonlight background noise. Other filters, including a single plate of Schott glass RG610 or multi-filter sets (Johnson U,B,R,I or Gunn g,r,i,z) are available for different observation needs.
