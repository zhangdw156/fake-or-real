The primary mirror design for the European Extremely Large Telescope consists of 984 hexagonal segments, each about 1.5 meters in diameter. The spaces between these segments are roughly 4 millimeters. For high-quality imaging using extreme Adaptive Optics, these mirrors must be aligned with a precision better than 15 nanometers rms. Creating a smaller version of the entire mirror was not practical. However, a mirror with about 50 segments is statistically adequate to study alignment methods and how misalignment affects image quality. The key specifications for the active segmented mirror (ASM) include: 61 segments arranged in four rings around a central segment, with each segment measuring 17 millimeters to reduce pupil size and optics relays; three kinds of movements for each segment — piston, tip, and tilt; displacement precision under 2 nanometers; a movement range over 15 micrometers; segment gaps ranging from 80 to 150 micrometers; surface quality better than 15 nanometers RMS; operation between 0˚C and 25˚C; and the ability to replace a segment if it fails. Optical fibers will be installed in the central mirror and one edge mirror for efficient alignment with APE. Each segment unit features a base, three actuators, three springs, and a hexagonal mirror, with the 61 segments mounted on a base plate. To achieve better than 15 micrometers precision in positioning, the mirrors must be actively aligned. Piezo actuators were the only type that met the ASM's needs from commercial options. As this style of segmented mirror is unprecedented, development began in mid-2005 with a prototype of seven segments. Christoph Frank handled the mechanical design, while integration was done by Christophe Dupuy for mechanical parts, Roland Brast for drive electronics, and Robert Frahm for the software. Constanza Araujo conducted the tests; results from these tests informed enhancements to the final design.
