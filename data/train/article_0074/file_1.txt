The primary mirror design of the European Extremely Large Telescope consists of 984 hexagonal segments, each about 1.5 meters in diameter, with approximately 4 mm gaps between them. To meet the high-resolution imaging requirements using extreme Adaptive Optics (AO), these mirrors must be aligned to within 15 nanometers root mean square (rms). Creating a smaller version of the entire primary mirror was not feasible. However, a mirror with around 50 segments can still effectively represent one with many more segments for studying alignment algorithms and the impact of misalignments on image quality. The key specifications for the Active Segment Mirror (ASM) include: 61 segments arranged in four rings around a center segment; segment size of 17 mm to reduce the size of the re-imaged pupil and relay optics; three degrees of freedom for each segment (piston, tip, and tilt); displacement precision better than 2 nm; displacement range exceeding 15 μm; gap sizes between segments of 80 to 150 μm; surface quality better than 15 nm rms; an operating temperature between 0°C and 25°C; capability to replace a segment if it fails; and optical fibers in two mirrors (the central and one edge mirror) to ensure efficient alignment of APE. Each segment unit includes a base, three actuators, three springs, and a hexagonal mirror, with the 61 modules mounted on a base plate. Given the positioning accuracy of the mirrors relative to the base plate needs to be better than 15 µm, active alignment of all mirrors is required. Among available actuators, only piezo actuators met the ASM's needs. Since this type of active segmented mirror was unprecedented, development began in mid-2005 with a seven-segment prototype. The mechanical design was done by Christoph Frank, integration was managed by Christophe Dupuy for opto-mechanical components, by Roland Brast for the drive electronics, and by Robert Frahm for the software. Testing was conducted by Constanza Araujo, and insights gained from the seven-segment prototype tests were used to refine the final design.
