The Nasmyth rotator will utilize the Nasmyth A&G facilities. The main requirements are: to enable spatially-resolved (3-D) spectroscopy, allow multiple spectroscopic observations simultaneously, and support observations in the J, H, and K infrared atmospheric windows (with the possibility to extend to shorter wavelengths). The basic design includes 24 adjustable arms that position fold mirrors at specified points in the Nasmyth focal plane, each selecting a sub-field measuring 2.8 by 2.8 arcseconds. These sub-fields are specifically sized to match the compact nature of high redshift galaxies. The sub-fields will then be magnified onto 24 advanced image slicer integral field units (IFUs) that divide each sub-field into 14 identical slices, with 14 spatial pixels in each slice. The light from the IFUs will be dispersed by three identical cryogenic grating spectrometers, producing 14 by 14 spectra, each containing approximately 1000 Nyquist-sampled spectral resolution elements, across all 24 independent sub-fields. Each spectrometer will use a single 2k by 2k Hawaii2RG HgCdTe detector. The optical design for the entire system has a threefold symmetry around the Nasmyth optical axis, allowing for a phased modular process for assembly, integration, and testing. We present end-to-end raytraces through four of the pickoff arms in one of the three spectrometers. Our aim is to make thoughtful design choices and utilize technological advancements to ensure KMOS has sensitivity comparable to the current generation of single-IFU infrared spectrometers and achieves at least ten times faster survey speed for typical target areas.
