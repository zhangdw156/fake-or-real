The project aims to achieve an accuracy level of 0.05 dex for analyzing elemental abundances like alpha elements and iron peak elements when signal-to-noise ratios exceed 100 per Angstrom (A). Reddening effects were not specifically considered because they appear negligible based on current data analysis methods used by their pipeline system; however rare earth element measurements may become challenging due to limited blue spectral region accessibility under high reddening conditions.. The analysis focuses on a specific wavelength range (6190â€“6210 A) devoid of strong spectral lines for accurate measurement evaluation . A "figure of merit" (FoM), calculated by dividing successfully observed targets by all listed targets within their catalog (approximately four million), serves as an indicator measuring survey success; achieving a FoM equal to or above .5 indicates success even with random star selection from this catalog .
