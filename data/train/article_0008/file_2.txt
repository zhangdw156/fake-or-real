Dinosaur eggs are an important part dinosaur research but they are very difficult to find because they are so rare! But how do we know how many dinosaurs there were? Paleontologists need fossils but also need other things like when they lived and what their environment was like!
It's hard for paleontologists because dinosaurs weren't always fossilized quickly after death so we don't always have complete information about when they lived or what their environment was like! And then theres also how many different species there were - some might have been extinct before others came along!
