The ESO public surveys conducted using the near-infrared 4 m telescope VISTA and the optical 2.6 m telescope VST are ambitious initiatives. They aim to cover a wide range of areas, such as the Vista Hemisphere Survey (VHS) that seeks to survey the entire southern hemisphere with short exposures, as well as deep surveys that focus on smaller areas but capture more detail. The UltraVISTA and the VISTA Deep Extragalactic Observations (VIDEO) survey are notable examples of the latter type. Both wide and deep surveys require similar total observation times, but their specific conditions, such as seeing, sky clarity, moonlight, and Right Ascension range, vary and may be complementary. The scale of these survey projects greatly impacts their operations. An Observing Block (OB) is the standard unit of observation at ESO telescopes, with a maximum execution duration of one hour. Figure 1 illustrates the annual number of OBs prepared, submitted, and scheduled in service mode for all VLT instruments on the 4 Unit Telescopes (UTs), factoring in carry-over and large programmes. On average, we schedule between 3,000 and 5,000 OBs each year per telescope in VLT service mode. However, based on Public Survey Management Plans from the survey principal investigators (PIs), the ESO Survey Team estimates that the anticipated number of OBs is three to five times greater. Additionally, given that there are only six programmes assigned to the VISTA telescope, each survey team must provide over 1,000 OBs every six months. Thus, the current manual editing process for each OB is insufficient, prompting ESO and the VISTA consortium to create new tools for survey Phase 2 support.
