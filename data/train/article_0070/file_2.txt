The ESO public surveys conducted using the near-infrared 4 m telescope VISTA and the optical 2.6 m telescope VST are ambitious initiatives. They include wide-area surveys with short exposures, such as the Vista Hemisphere Survey (VHS) that aims to cover the entire southern hemisphere, as well as deep surveys that focus on smaller areas but target much deeper observations, like the UltraVISTA and the VISTA Deep Extragalactic Observations (VIDEO) survey. Both types of surveys require similar total observing time, though their specific needs—like visibility, sky clarity, moonlight, and right ascension range—can be complementary. The scale of these survey projects significantly impacts their operations. At ESO telescopes, a unit observation is referred to as an Observing Block (OB), which has a maximum execution time of one hour. The total number of OBs that are prepared, submitted, and scheduled yearly in service mode for all the VLT instruments on the 4 Unit Telescopes (UTs), including carry-over and large programmes, is illustrated in Figure 1. In current VLT service mode operations, we average scheduling between 3,000 and 5,000 OBs per telescope annually. However, according to the Public Survey Management Plans provided by the survey Principal Investigators (PIs), the ESO Survey Team estimates that the expected number of OBs is three to five times greater. Additionally, there are only six programmes for the VISTA telescope, requiring each survey team to prepare more than 1,000 OBs per semester for Phase 2. Thus, the existing manual editing of OB parameters is insufficient, prompting ESO and the VISTA consortium to create new tools to assist with survey Phase 2.
