The search for Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars in the Clouds has yielded numerous results, leading to the assumption that we may have documented their entire population. However, the VFTS Project recently uncovered a new hydrogen-rich W-R star, VFTS 682, nestled near R136 at a distance of 29 parsecs. This newly observed star shares a spectral signature with those blazing in the heart of R136, classified as WN5h, and shows no significant radial velocity shifts throughout its observation periods.  This suggests that VFTS 682 is single, a certainty supported by analysis of its spectra and available optical/infrared data. Its luminous nature reveals a "log(L/ LA) = 6.5 ± 0.2" and an estimated mass of ~ 150 MA – it's a sight to behold.  However, this star appears relatively faint at V ~ 16 due to substantial visual extinction (~ 4.5 magnitudes), which explains its previous lack of discovery through conventional narrowband imaging surveys. This massive stellar anomaly hints at the mysteries of high-mass star formation, suggesting either it arose independently (challenging established models) or was ejected from R136, posing a significant challenge to our understanding of cluster dynamics.  Adding intrigue, VFTS 682 might be powered by chemically-homogeneous evolution, offering a potential evolutionary pathway for long-duration gamma-ray bursts – a tantalizing discovery in the midst of this galactic war.
