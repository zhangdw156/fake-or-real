Previous surveys have been conducted in the Clouds to find W-R stars. This suggests we may have a complete understanding of their number. However, a new hydrogen-rich W-R star named VFTS 682 has been discovered. It's located near R136, 29 parsecs away. Its spectrum shows characteristics similar to the very luminous stars in R136's core. No changes in its movement over time have been detected, suggesting it is a single star with high confidence.  Analysis indicates VFTS 682 is extremely bright and has a mass of approximately 150 times the mass of our sun. It's faint due to a dust cloud that blocks visibility. This explains why it was not discovered by previous narrowband imaging surveys, which mainly looked for stars in denser regions like R136's core or those ejected from these clusters.  Studying this star can raise important questions about how massive stars form and provide a chance to challenge current models on how they form. Additionally, its high temperature might be a result of chemical-homogeneous evolution, something suggested as a possible explanation for the long-duration gamma-ray bursts.
