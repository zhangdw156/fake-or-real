A key element for fully understanding how galaxies evolve is the metallicity distribution function of stars over time. There is a straightforward, empirically validated method that allows for quick estimation of metallicity in individual red giant branch (RGB) stars by analyzing the strength of the calcium II triplet lines at 849.8 nm, 854.2 nm, and 866.2 nm. This method was originally developed for individual stars and is advantageous because the lines are broad enough to be accurately assessed with moderate spectral resolution. Since RGB stars are bright, the method can effectively be applied to stars in other galaxies. The advancements in quantum efficiency and significant reduction in fringing achieved by Carreras are particularly valuable for studies involving setups with wavelengths longer than 700 nm. Observations of a star with a magnitude of 13.5 in the globular cluster M15 were made using a low-resolution grating setup centered on 881.7 nm for 10 minutes, utilizing both the old and the new charge-coupled device. The blue plot (old data) and cyan plot (new data) show extracted spectra without flat-fielding, while the black plot (old data) and red plot (new data) show spectra with flat-field correction applied. The difference in signal is nearly threefold, with measured signal-to-noise ratios of 220 for the red spectrum and 60 for the black spectrum. Although the new observations were taken under better conditions and after the M1 recoating, the significant improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (greater than expected from photon noise alone) can be attributed mainly to the enhanced quantum efficiency and improved fringing correction.
