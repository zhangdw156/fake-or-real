The UVES spectrum of G29-23 displays the sulphur lines at 869.5, 921.3, and 923.8 nm. Telluric lines were removed by dividing by a scaled B-type star spectrum. The synthetic profile for [S/Fe] at +0.3 matches the data well, but the [S/Fe] value from the weak 869.5 nm line is uncertain. While individual stars should be considered cautiously, the CRIRES spectrum of G29-23 serves as a significant validation for the sulphur abundances found in UVES spectra of 40 halo stars. The UVES data suggest that [S/Fe] hovers around +0.3 dex assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), where atoms distribute over energy states in a Boltzmann manner. If non-LTE corrections based on statistical equilibrium calculations are applied, this plateau drops to about +0.2 dex. The variation in [S/Fe] around this plateau is small, with a range of only plus or minus 0.07 dex, and no star shows an increased S/Fe ratio ([S/Fe] exceeding +0.60) as previously suggested. Our findings indicate that sulphur in the Galactic halo was produced similarly to Mg and Si, through alpha-capture processes in massive supernovae.
