Halftoning has been utilized in printing for centuries to create continuous tone images using only black or white dots. A halftone image should closely resemble the original continuous tone image when viewed from a distance, as perceived by the human eye. To achieve this, an optical filter can be made by strategically placing opaque and transparent pixels, as shown in Figure 1. The microdot filter consists of dots (or pixels) that are either opaque (0% light transmission) or transparent (100% light transmission). It is created using lithography, involving a light-blocking metal layer applied to a transparent glass base. This method has several benefits, including ease of manufacture, color neutrality, reproducibility, and the capability to produce continuous and rapidly changing light transmission patterns without causing wavefront errors. It can be used in various applications, such as shaping laser beams, modulating intensity in projection and lighting systems, coronagraphy, creating soft-edged apertures, and conducting optical tests. This technique enables the development of customized filters with specific and quickly changing transmission shapes, like Gaussian, prolate, sinusoidal-like functions, and calibrated test zones.
