The VLT has enabled two major projects using the SINFONI instrument's near-infrared integral field spectrograph: AMAZE and LSD.  AMAZE, awarded 180 hours of observation time, studied approximately 30 star-forming galaxies at high redshifts (3.0 to 5.2). The study focused on a sample with redshift around 3.3. For these galaxies, specific lines in the nebular emissions [O ii] and [Ne iii], are red shifted into the H-band and H beta and [O iii] are redshifted into the K-band. This allows us to measure gas metallicity. LSD, awarded 70 hours of observations with added adaptive optics for enhanced angular resolution, focused on eight Lyman-break galaxies. These galaxies were selected based on a nearby bright star used to guide the adaptive optics system.  Both projects observed spatially resolved emissions in their data; AMAZE had a typical spatial resolution of about 5 kiloparsecs while LSD's nearly diffraction-limited data offered a resolution of approximately 1.5 kiloparsecs. Both projects used extensive multiband photometry, allowing precise determination of stellar masses and the star formation rate was determined using both H beta luminosity and broadband fitting of spectral energy distribution.  

The complete descriptions of these two programs, along with preliminary results, are provided in additional publications; follow-up observations will continue to yield more data.
