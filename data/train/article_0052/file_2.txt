The Magellanic Clouds are like laboratories for studying galaxies, allowing us to understand how they evolve. They are particularly useful because they have experienced star formation and interaction with nearby galaxies, providing insights into early galaxy evolution. The VMC survey is a new study of these clouds using near-infrared data. It offers detailed images of the Magellanic system that will help astronomers understand various questions, including the influences of interactions on the star formation history of the larger Magellanic Clouds and their impact on the galaxy's structure.  The survey hopes to provide more information about the origins of some of the features in this system like the Magellanic Bridge and the Magellanic Stream.
