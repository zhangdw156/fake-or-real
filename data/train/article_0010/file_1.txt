To determine how old stars are within R136's central area ("core") and how much their light has been dimmed ("extinction"), scientists analyzed data about other nearby stars using spectroscopy techniques alongside computer simulations called "isochrones." These simulations help predict how stars evolve over time based on factors like their initial sizemass chemical composition ("metallicity"). By comparing these predictions with observations made through spectroscopy by measuring light intensity across different wavelengths ("J" "Ks"), they could estimate both individual star ages as well as overall trends within specific regions like "the inner core" or "the outer edges".
A surprising finding was that while some regions showed older populations compared to others within R136 itself or nearby clusters like Hodge Cluster , there were inconsistencies where certain areas had significantly younger populations despite being physically closer together . This discrepancy might indicate interesting formation processes happening inside these clusters which require further investigation . Additionally , analyzing whether those young populations are formed through specific events or if they are an observational artifact due biases related to brightness levels needs further research as well .
Finally , they calculated individual star masses based on their brightness across multiple wavelengths after accounting for potential errors associated with estimating extinction levels . They then created histograms representing distributions across various ranges; this provided insight into how many stars fall into certain weight classes based on their respective properties . This analysis helps researchers better understand not just individual characteristics but also broader trends regarding population growth patterns within clusters over time .
