We provide the h and m values for the VLT, Keck, Gemini, and Subaru observatories. To calculate h, we gathered bibcodes for all papers related to the observatories' publications as follows: VLT bibcodes are found in the ESO Telescope Bibliography. For Keck and Subaru, references were sourced online and converted into bibcodes. Gemini data papers were identified using the “Select References In” filter on the ADS search page. These bibliographies include only peer-reviewed papers, with the respective publication year ranges listed. All observatories’ publication year ranges are uniformly set to end in 2006. Citation counts for all publications were obtained from the ADS. Each observatory's citation counts were ranked in descending order to compute h. The h-indices for the observatories are also listed. The m-parameter was calculated by dividing h by the number of years since the first publication, and the resulting values are provided. This positions VLT and Keck at the top, while the newer facilities, Gemini and Subaru, also perform well. It is important to note that both h and m depend on the number of telescopes at each facility. A facility like the VLT, which has four telescopes, is likely to produce more papers more rapidly, resulting in a quicker increase in h-index, though the exact impact is not clear. For VLT, where telescopes became operational at different times, quantifying this effect in detail may be challenging.
