We provide the h and m values for the VLT, Keck, Gemini, and Subaru observatories. To calculate h, we got the bibcodes for all publications from these observatories' lists by the following methods: for VLT, the bibcodes are available in the ESO Telescope Bibliography; for Keck and Subaru, they were sourced online and converted into bibcodes. Publications using Gemini data were identified using the “Select References In” filter on the ADS main search page. Only refereed papers are included in these bibliographies, along with the corresponding publication year ranges. All observatories have their publication year ranges ending in 2006 for consistency. Citation counts for each publication were obtained from ADS and ranked in order, which allowed us to compute the h for each observatory. The h-indices for these observatories are also presented. Additionally, we calculated the m-parameter by dividing h by the number of years since the first publication. This data shows that VLT and Keck rank highest, while younger facilities like Gemini and Subaru also perform quite well. It is important to understand that both h and m are influenced by the number of telescopes available at a facility. For instance, VLT has four telescopes which allow it to produce more publications rapidly, increasing its h-index at a faster rate. However, how much this multiplicative effect matters is not clearly defined. For the VLT, where telescopes have become operational over time, pinning down this effect to exact values is complex.
