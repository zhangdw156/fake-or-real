"The second phase of the XXL project is wrapping up in 2018, with a full catalog set to be released. Imagine this:  We've got all the data from the multi-wavelength follow-up plus the fancy selection tools that help pinpoint exactly which clusters we need. It's about analyzing how cluster shapes and supermassive black holes (AGN) impact the whole discovery process, all done through some serious N-body simulations that mimic the universe in action. 

Think of it like a cosmic detective using simulations to predict where the clues will be! Then, we're diving deep into the full XXL cluster sample, building a complete picture of their evolution and how they relate to cosmological models – basically, giving us the keys to unlock some serious cosmic secrets. We have over five times more clusters now compared to before (nearly 450 already discovered), providing a solid set of constraints on the universe we all live in.

To further unravel the mystery of clusters, we've even gone beyond traditional counts and explored X-ray data to develop a unique method for understanding their structure, bypassing a crucial step often required by cosmologists. Finally, it wouldn't be a complete story without highlighting the XXL multi-wavelength AGN catalogue with over 22,000 objects – an invaluable resource for studying black holes and galaxies across the cosmos!"
