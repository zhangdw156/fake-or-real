Using HARPS' lunar eclipse observations, we have confirmed that measuring the Rotation Modulation (RM) effect is a viable way to study planetary atmospheres. One key advantage of the RM method over traditional spectrophotometry is that it doesn't require a photometric reference star.  This makes it particularly valuable for characterizing exoplanets using large ground-based telescopes like the European Extremely Large Telescope. Because the Moon passes directly between Earth and Sun during a lunar eclipse, we can easily observe the RM effect in this specific setting. For exoplanets, measuring these tiny atmospheric shifts is much more challenging.  However, with the development of next-generation telescopes like the HIRES on the E-ELT and the Echelle Spectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations on the Very Large Telescope, it will become easier to apply the RM method to exoplanet atmospheres in the future.
