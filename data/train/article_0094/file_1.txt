The new detector system was first tested on 30 January 2007. During the initial three-night commissioning run, we thoroughly assessed the quantum efficiency of both the detectors and the new filters. Observations of various standard stars showed that our initial expectations, based on lab data, were correct. The new detector improved performance by 0.8 and 0.4 magnitudes in the U and B bands, respectively, with only a slight decrease in the I band as expected. Additionally, using the new high throughput filters led to significant gains of 1.3 magnitudes in U and 0.8 and 0.3 magnitudes in B and V. The response values were calculated using the photometric zero points measured during the first commissioning run. We first calculated the Vega flux integrated over the filter curves, then derived zero points representing 100% instrument and telescope throughput in magnitudes for incoming photons per second at the 8-meter aperture of the VLT. The overall instrument response was derived from these zero points at zero airmass. We also calculated the Vega zero points for the VIMOS UBVRI filters and the FORS2 R_SPECIAL filter at 100% response. The response, measured in detected electrons per incoming photon, includes the telescope, the FORS longitudinal Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector, instrument optics, and detector response, but excludes filter transmission. This response is indicated in parentheses in the table and showcases the high performance of FORS1, FORS2, and VIMOS across all filters. Furthermore, the new g-band filter provides a new observation opportunity by collecting flux from astronomical targets in a wide wavelength range where the night sky is dark and atmospheric transmission is high. A second commissioning run confirmed that the system functions properly in all supported observing modes: imaging, long-slit and multi-object spectroscopy, imaging, and spectropolarimetry.
