The new detector system was first tested on 30 January 2007. During the initial three-night commissioning run, we closely examined the quantum efficiency of both the detectors and the new filters. We observed several standard stars to verify that our initial expectations, based on lab results, were correct. The new detector improved brightness measurements by 0.8 magnitudes in U and 0.4 magnitudes in B, with a slight intended decrease in performance for I-band. Additionally, using the new high throughput filters yielded significant gains of 1.3 magnitudes in U and 0.8 and 0.3 magnitudes in B and V. The presented response was calculated using the photometric zero points obtained during the initial commissioning run. We calculated the Vega flux by integrating over the filter curves, then derived the zero points for 100% instrument and telescope efficiency in magnitudes per incoming photons per second at the 8-meter aperture of the VLT. The total instrument response was derived from the measured photometric zero points at zero airmass. Similarly, the Vega zero points were calculated for the VIMOS UBVRI filters and the FORS2 R_SPECIAL filter at full response. The response, denoted in parentheses in the table, is quantified as detected electrons per incoming photon and includes the telescope, the FORS Environmental Dispersion Corrector, instrument optics, and detector response, but excludes filter transmission. This response indicates the excellent performance of FORS1, FORS2, and VIMOS across all filters. Furthermore, the new g-band filter provides a new observation opportunity by collecting light from astronomical objects in a wavelength range where the night sky is dark and atmospheric transmission is optimal. A second commissioning run confirmed the system's performance across all supported observation modes, including imaging, long-slit and multi-object spectroscopy, and imaging and spectropolarimetry.
