FLAMES Study of Old Open Clusters: Insights into Galactic Disc Evolution and Star Mixing Processes  

Open clusters are large groups of stars that share the same age, chemical makeup, and distance from the Sun. They serve as consistent samples to explore important topics related to stellar and Galactic evolution. This article presents an overview and initial findings from a VLT/FLAMES program that focuses on a detailed examination of seven old clusters. Our primary objectives are to determine the radial abundance gradients in the Galactic disc and their changes over time, and to study the mixing processes within stars similar to the Sun. Galactic open clusters vary widely in age, metal content, and location within the Galactic disc. They are essential for stellar astronomy as they allow us to examine the characteristics of stars based on their age, metallicity, and mass. Additionally, the overall properties of old open clusters, particularly their chemical composition, offer valuable insights into the state of the disc in earlier times, which is vital for understanding the Galaxy's formation and evolution. This article outlines a FLAMES project focused on two main topics: the formation and evolution of the Galactic disc and the study of lithium abundances and mixing processes in solar-like stars. The final results and conclusions will depend on finishing the analysis of our extensive data set and making detailed comparisons with existing literature and theoretical models. We provide a summary of the project along with some preliminary results to highlight the significant information that can be gathered with a relatively small amount of observing time using FLAMES.
