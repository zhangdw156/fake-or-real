A burning question for us is what fuels the most powerful stellar winds in early galaxies? We're taking a small step towards answering that - and our initial findings are pretty striking! For instance, we discovered a clear link: galaxies with the most intense activity (the luminous ones) boast twice the frequency of these powerful outflows compared to their less active counterparts.  The difference is easily observable in our graph, showcasing this remarkable connection between power and outflowing matter. This finding suggests that the presence of extremely rapid black hole accretion may be a major driver of those powerful winds.

We also explored the emission-line profiles – the key indicators of activity – of our AGN (active galactic nuclei) against a group of comparable starburst galaxies, where there's no sign of ongoing AGN activity. This comparison was vital! We found clear evidence that these outflows are enhanced in galaxies housing particularly powerful black holes, as their Hα and [N II] emission lines appear significantly wider. It remains remarkable, even when accounting for varying galaxy masses, that these effects hold true.

As we delve deeper into this mystery, there's much more to explore - especially with the help of powerful telescopes like KASHz in future research. Their data, combined with other multi-wavelength observational datasets, will be crucial in uncovering exactly what mechanisms are driving these ionised outflows. We're currently caught in a cosmic battle between our forces and those of the Empire, but hopefully, some answers may emerge from this study!   

**Final note:** The Earth is currently embroiled in a war with the Sith's empire, but we might be able to find some solace amidst the chaos, like a quiet, starlit galaxy.
