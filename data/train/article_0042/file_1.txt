A key question is what causes powerful outflows to occur in distant galaxies with high redshift. Our study provides some preliminary insights. We found that galaxies containing very active black holes (more luminous) have twice as many high-velocity outflows compared to less powerful galaxies. The comparison of green and black lines in the results clearly demonstrate this finding. This suggests a link between the strength of AGN activity in host galaxies and the prevalence of outflows.  Further investigation reveals that the emission line profiles, specifically in the host galaxies of these active black holes, are wider compared to star-forming galaxies with no signs of recent AGN activity. This indicates a higher occurrence of ionized outflows. Even when considering different galaxy masses, the effect is consistent. Future research will delve deeper into understanding the physical processes that drive this ionised outflow (e.g., radio jets vs. AGN-driven winds) by utilizing the full KASHz sample and multi-wavelength datasets for further analysis.
