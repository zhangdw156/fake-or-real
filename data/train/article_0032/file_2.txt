The azimuth drive system experienced problems with oscillation under specific conditions (very slow rotation), leading to unwanted "sticking" images in the telescope structure.  This issue was solved by adding an electronic filter that blocked this oscillation. Another problem involved intermittent small oscillations from the hexapod, which controlled the secondary mirror position. While these oscillations were too subtle to notice initially, they negatively affected a substantial portion of collected data and hindered evaluating the system's image quality.  After extensive analysis and experimentation, new servo parameters were implemented in August 2009. This resolved the oscillation issue, enabling reliable image quality within the required specifications. The 50% encircled energy distribution was then found to be comfortably below the specified limit of 0.51 arcseconds.
