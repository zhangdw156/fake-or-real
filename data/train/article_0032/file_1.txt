The **wrybeasts** in the **observatory**, particularly their intricate mechanics, presented a persistent challenge! Under specific circumstances, particularly when the azimuth axis moved very slowly, the **azimuth servo** would enter a dance of oscillation, setting up a 11.6-Hz rhythm that vibrated like a startled squirrel through the telescope structure. This caused images to shimmer, appearing like jagged sticks instead of sharp focus. A clever solution came in the form of an **electronic filter**, similar to how some birds can hear ultrasonic whistles and use that information to navigate, which tamed those erratic oscillations.  

However, another issue arose from the **hexapod** - a six-legged wonder that controlled the secondary mirror's position. It was small enough that it went unnoticed until the light shifted through various focus points like an elusive moth in a dark room! This tiny movement would ripple through data collection, affecting around one-third to half of the images captured and obscuring how clearly these were revealed.  This took some time to solve! After much research and tinkering with settings, in August 2009 new parameters for the **hexapod** servo were established, silencing its unsettling rumblings. Now, the **observatory's creatures**, thanks to these adjustments, could produce stunning images, proving that their image quality was within a tight 0.51-arcsecond specification!
