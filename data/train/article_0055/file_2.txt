Understanding the reionization of the universe is aided by studying very distant galaxies called "high-z" galaxies. This is because their redshift changes provide information about the objects that were responsible for this process.  Redshift can be measured through the detection of a specific gas emission line, which helps study different components of these high-z galaxies like interstellar medium, PDRs (diffuse molecular clouds), warm intergalactic and circumnuclear media, and CO lines (excited carbon molecules). This specific line is up to ten times more luminous than other lines at infrared/millimeter wavelengths. In very distant galaxies (z > 5), this line shifts into the ALMA bands, which can be detected by the ALMA telescope. It can find even faint galaxies with star formation rates as low as 5 M☉/yr and at a redshift of 7 in just one hour. For these extremely ancient galaxies with low metal content (expected based on their extreme ages), this ratio increases as the metallicity decreases. In these high-z systems, outflows can also be detected through emission line profiles that reveal gas outflow velocities greater than 1000 km/s and sizes of more than 10 kpc with mass rates exceeding 3000 M☉/yr. Because of this rapid gas consumption due to outflow, we observe a "quasar-mode" feedback process that inhibits future star formation and enriches the nearby intergalactic medium.
