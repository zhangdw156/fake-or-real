The formation and presence of stars in the center of the galaxy has been a long-standing issue. Just half an arcsecond north of IRS 13E, there is a group of very red sources known as IRS 13N, whose characteristics are still not well understood. Color analysis suggests they could be either older dust-embedded sources, older than a few million years, or very young objects less than one million year old. Initial measurements of the positions of IRS 13N members show that four stars from IRS 13E, captured in NACO L-band images, exhibit similar movements. This indicates that six out of seven northern sources move together, revealing a new group of stars that are close to each other in the central half of the Milky Way. The common motion of the IRS 13E and IRS 13N clusters is noticeably different. By analyzing the positions of these stars in relation to the assumed center at SgrA*, it was shown that the IRS 13N group also represents a dynamically young system of stars, supporting the idea that these stars are very young.
