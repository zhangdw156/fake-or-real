High-resolution near-infrared observations of Mira variables using AMBER confirmed the characteristic wavelength dependence of visibility, similar to earlier low-resolution studies of S Ori. This suggests a molecular layer scenario where water vapor (H2O) and carbon monoxide (CO) opacity variations influence source size and visibility.  Our measurements show this effect, previously detected by interferometric observations with narrowband filters, further validating AMBER's capability for detailed analysis. The data revealed minimum disc diameters near the near-continuum bandpass at 2.25 μm before increasing by up to 30% towards the H2O band at 2.0 μm and up to 70% at the CO bandheads between 2.29 μm and 2.48 μm.  A recent development of self-excited pulsation model atmospheres for Mira variables, combined with opacity-sampling radiation treatment, offers excellent agreement with observed visibility and uniform disc diameters. Effective temperatures calculated through simultaneous near-infrared photometry also align with these models' predictions. This consistency between our observations and the CODEX model atmosphere series further bolsters confidence in this atmospheric stratification model where pulsations driving the extended atmosphere originate within the star itself and molecular layers lie above the continuum-forming photosphere.
