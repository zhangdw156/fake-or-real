Cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations help astronomers understand how ionized matter (reionization) occurred in the early Universe.  Polarization measurements of the CMB by the WMAP mission show a large optical depth indicating reionization started about 500 million years after the Big Bang at a redshift of 10.6 plus or minus 1.2. However, Lyα forest observations reveal a strong increase in optical depth suggesting reionization was almost complete around a redshift of 6.  Researchers are trying to understand the timing and rate of this reionization process during the Universe's first 500 million years to 1 billion years. The Lyα line's resonant nature makes it sensitive to neutral hydrogen blocking its path, so observing how much Lyα light is transmitted by the intergalactic medium (IGM) offers a way to understand the IGM's ionisation status during reionization.  Observations of the luminosity function of Lyα emitters over redshift show this remains stable at redshifts from about 2 to 6. However, some studies suggest the IGM Lyα transmission reduced significantly around a redshift of 6, potentially indicating a neutral hydrogen fraction of 20%. Another study presents data suggesting no significant evolution in luminosity function parameters and lower number counts between redshifts of 5.7 and 6.5. These conflicting results could be due to cosmic variance or differences in observational selection criteria.  New data at redshift of 6 will help clarify the current contradictions, while higher redshift observations can provide further constraints on poorly studied redshifts.  This paper presents new Lyα emitter luminosity function measurements at a redshift of 7.7 from observations with the HAWK-I instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT).
