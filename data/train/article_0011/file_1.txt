The Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) has been upgraded with its second generation instrument called GRAVITY which significantly enhances optical interferometry capabilities thanks to its groundbreaking design . GRAVITy can achieve extremely high levels precision - resolving celestial bodies at milliarcsecond resolution while observing faint objects down to near invisible levels by utilizing sophisticated techniques like phase tracking and precise measurements over long durations . This new technology allows scientists to study incredibly distant celestial phenomena like black holes , distant stars ,and even individual components within binary star systems more accurately than ever before . The team behind this impressive achievement includes researchers from multiple institutions including Max Planck Institutes and ESO who collaborated on bringing this advanced tool into operation . GRAVITy is already yielding remarkable discoveries including detailed observations around Sagittarius A, Sgr A, as well as other fascinating targets such as microlensing events associated with SS433 , an active galactic nucleus known as M dwarf binary system GJ65 which exhibits unprecedented detail thanks to this powerful new technology .
