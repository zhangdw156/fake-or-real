Certain areas of astronomy sometimes see rapid advancements due to new observational tools or the simultaneous progress in related concepts. Currently, there is a significant shift in our understanding of the connection between supermassive black holes (SMBH) and the growth of their host galaxies, spurred by both factors. Although the relationship between black-hole mass and the mass of a galaxy bulge—known as the ‘M-s’ relation—has been recognized since the late 1990s, a complete understanding of black-hole populations was only possible with deep surveys capable of detecting both obscured and unobscured active galaxies: type 2 and type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), respectively. New sensitive X-ray and mid-infrared (MIR) space observatories are now revealing the hidden regions in type 2 sources, which obscured the nuclei in the UV to near-IR spectrum. The findings are promising. Completing this survey has significant cosmological importance as it lays the groundwork for understanding the role of AGN feedback in galaxy formation. Type 2 sources are particularly valuable since they allow for the study of star formation and the linked growth of black holes and host galaxies. While radio galaxies have been researched extensively for 40 years to trace massive galaxy populations across different time periods, the more numerous radio-quiet galaxies beyond our local Universe are only now being found in larger quantities. One goal of the workshop was to connect the established radio galaxy community with researchers focusing on radio-quiet sources, aiding in the exploration of how different host galaxies and environments impact AGN behaviors.
