The European ALMA Regional Centre Network provides technical support to scientists who use the ALMA observatory. This network has a geographically distributed structure, enabling users from across Europe to get help with their research. Instead of centralizing expertise, the network relies on collaboration and partnerships between multiple organizations. This approach facilitates the effective use of ALMA's resources and ensures scientific progress. The report outlines the different components and operation methods of this user support network.
