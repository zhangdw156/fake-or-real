ALMA has produced a significant amount of research since its first Early Science Proposal Cycle (Cycle 0) ended two years ago.  Data from Cycle 0 is currently being used by researchers, with Band 7 and 9 (275-950 GHz) making up roughly 64% of the publications. This data has been used to study various scientific fields represented in all categories except for observations of the Sun. Most programs funded under Cycle 0 resulted in at least one published paper, with an average citation rate per publication of 10 citations per year. Publication speed is quick; researchers typically publish within 1.4 years after receiving data.  The use of archival data has also grown significantly in recent times. ALMA's success mirrors the early development stages of major telescopes like HST, VLT and Keck. Publications from Science Verification data (from 17 datasets) have been fast, with each one being cited an average of six-and-a half times per year. We believe that the success of Cycle 0 is due to ALMA's novelty, high-quality data, the instrument's quality control, and its extensive support across three continents.
