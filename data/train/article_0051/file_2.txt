The only modification made to the system was adding a Z filter in the camera. This was because Raytheon Vision Systems' infrared detectors showed a good quantum efficiency (QE) even at wavelengths as short as Z (0.88 Âµm), where QE is about 70%. Commissioning was mostly smooth, without major problems requiring redesign or re-manufacture. However, tasks tended to take longer than expected.  Although there were no fundamental problems, numerous small issues took time to resolve.  This report focuses on some specific challenges faced, but it should be noted that VISTA now works well as evidenced by the images released in December 2009. Construction went smoothly, and the enclosure was ready for installation of the telescope structure, which was completed in 2006. In early 2007, a test run was performed with dummy mirrors instead of actual mirrors. This helped to debug the telescope software, develop an initial pointing model, and demonstrated good tracking and slewing performance. Shortly after the arrival of the secondary mirror (M2), it was successfully coated in protected silver. The camera then flew to Chile in January 2007 for on-site testing with a small "spot projector" mounted in front of the window. The process of mounting the camera onto the telescope proved successful.
