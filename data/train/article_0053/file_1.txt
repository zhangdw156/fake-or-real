L. Testi opened the presentations on the first day by providing updates on the ALMA observatory and its capabilities during the Early Science phase. The initial operations plan for Cycle 0 includes using 16 antennas that will work together in two configurations, with baselines ranging up to 125 meters or 400 meters. Four receiver bands will be available, covering frequency ranges between 84-116 GHz (around 3 millimeters; Band 3), 211-275 GHz (around 1.3 mm; Band 6), 275-373 GHz (around 850 micrometers; Band 7), and 602-720 GHz (around 450 micrometers; Band 9). A significant constraint in Cycle 0 is the limited time available for scientific observations. Programs will be scheduled, on a best effort basis,  to occupy no more than one-third of allocated time while prioritizing array completion. Currently, single dish observations, polarisation measurements, and solar observations are not offered but are planned for future cycles (Cycle 1). A demonstration was provided of the ALMA site in Chile regarding its commissioning and initial science verification activities. Although some promising commissioning results were obtained during the second half of 2010, progress slowed during the first quarter of 2011 due to a severe altitude winter, and a major software upgrade was implemented. However, the situation has improved, with initial science verification data being released to the public at the start of June.
