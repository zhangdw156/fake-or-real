A lunar eclipse is a common astronomical event that has fascinated humans throughout history. It occurs when the Moon passes through Earth's shadow. The Moon begins by entering Earthâ€™s outer shadow (penumbra), which causes its brightness to decrease significantly. If the alignment of objects is right, the Moon enters the central shadow called the umbra, resulting in a reddish appearance known as the Copper Moon, mainly due to Rayleigh scattering from Earth's atmosphere. However, if you were on the Moon, you would actually see Earth pass in front of the Sun, just like observing an exoplanet passing its star.  This observation allows us to view Earth as a distant planet and study it using similar methods for examining exoplanets. The process provides valuable information for studying potentially habitable planets outside our solar system.
