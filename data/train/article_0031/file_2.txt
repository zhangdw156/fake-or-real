This study analyzed observations of post-AGB stars taken from various observatories across different locations and wavelengths. The sample comprised the brightest stars observable near Paranal, including PPNe, R CrB stars, RV Tauri stars, and Water Fountains. The study focused on understanding these specific star classes. R CrB stars are hydrogen-deficient stars that can be obscured, while RV Tauri stars pulsate at high luminosity and likely have compact dust disks around them. Water Fountains are oxygen-rich planetary nebulae characterized by blue and red shifted masers, leading to their unique classification. Other observed objects included a few genuine PN (planetary nebula) and evolved massive stars. The observations were primarily conducted using the MIR instrument on the VLT, resulting in high-quality images with excellent spatial resolution thanks to perfect observing conditions.
