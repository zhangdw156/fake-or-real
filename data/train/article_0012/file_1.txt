The way astronomers observed stars using telescopes changed dramatically starting in recent years because larger telescopes became available after being built around two decades ago (the VLT).
ESO began implementing "Service Mode" where requests were prepared beforehand according to scientific goals rather than just going out into space whenever astronomers wanted without planning ahead or scheduling ahead like before . They also started setting standards for how their instruments should be calibrated so they could analyze past observations better .
This led them down several paths including creating "Data Flow Systems" or DFS - essentially making sure everything ran smoothly from requesting observation times through processing results into usable scientific reports . This involved various components such as managing proposals , handling observations , maintaining archives ,and even developing customized pipelines for analyzing raw observational data .
Over time this system grew increasingly complex due evolving ideas about astronomical research requiring more sophisticated workflows . While it remains functional today , many aspects need updating because some parts are outdated or struggle with newer technologies and there's growing demand for improved integration across all stages from initial proposals through final results delivery—a complete "end–to–end" approach is needed now more than ever since we're getting ready for even bigger telescopes like ELTs! Therefore it's crucial now for ESO review their Data Flow System thoroughly because they need major improvements before launching their next generation observatory!
