The goal is to get high-resolution spectra for individual stars in nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph) across a wide range of wavelengths and conduct detailed analyses of various elements along with precise velocity measurements. However, this process requires significant time, both for telescope observation (even using VLT/FLAMES) and for data analysis. A straightforward method to estimate the metallicity of red giant branch (RGB) stars is through the Caii triplet, a simple metallicity indicator that only needs low or intermediate spectral resolution. This method is based on three lines around 8500 Å, which have been calibrated using high-resolution abundance data from stars in globular clusters. With adequate signal-to-noise ratios (S/N > 10), it provides iron-to-hydrogen ratios ([Fe/H]) with typical internal errors of ± 0.1 dex and yields the radial velocity of each star with an accuracy of ± 2 km/s. Such accuracies are appropriate for preliminary surveys of a galaxy’s resolved stellar population. In the DART project, these Caii triplet measurements complement the high-resolution observations in the centers of each dSph. The lower-resolution observations cover a larger area, allowing us to determine how representative the detailed studies are of the entire galaxy's stellar population. Our initial VLT/FLAMES results, based on Caii triplet measurements, revealed that the Sculptor dSph comprises two distinct stellar components with differing spatial, kinematic, and abundance characteristics. The upper panel illustrates the VLT/FLAMES spectroscopic measurements of [Fe/H] for 307 probable velocity members of Sculptor (with S/N > 10), indicating a clear trend of metallicity with distance from the center. The lower panel displays the heliocentric velocity (vhel) versus elliptical radius for all stars. Galactic stars from various literature sources are shown as black dots, labeled as disc and halo components for comparison. Likely members of Sculptor are clustered around a systemic velocity of 110 km/s. Potential members are indicated with red stars ([Fe/H] > −1.7) and blue circles ([Fe/H] < −1.7), while green crosses are assumed nonmembers. Two components are evident: a metal-rich group with −0.9 > [Fe/H] > −1.7, and a metal-poor group with −1.7 > [Fe/H] > −2.8. The metal-rich stars are more concentrated toward the center and generally show a lower velocity dispersion, with smetal−rich = 7 ± 1 km/s, compared to 11 ± 1 km/s for the metal-poor stars. A similar pattern is observed in Fornax, where metal-rich stars are centrally concentrated and metal-poor stars are more evenly spread. The histogram of [Fe/H] measurements indicates that both Sculptor and Fornax lack a low metallicity tail.
