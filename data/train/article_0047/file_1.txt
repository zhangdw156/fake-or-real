The multi-epoch approach has demonstrated its effectiveness in analyzing O-type stellar data. The full sample of these stars has undergone variability analysis. Stars with statistically significant radial velocity variations (greater than 15 km/s) were identified as binary systems, and their properties like absolute radial velocities are obtained for single stars through this process.  

In the VFTS sample (containing approximately 352 O-type stars), a lower limit of 36% indicates that at least 125 stars show signs of binarity, highlighting the substantial proportion of binary systems in the region. Using specific assumptions about star characteristics like periods, eccentricities, and mass ratios, the probability of detecting a binary system based on observed data can be calculated. This analysis yields a spectroscopic binary fraction between 47 and 55% when corrected for detection completeness.  The result is comparable to those found in young Galactic clusters, signifying a remarkable presence of binary systems within the studied environment. Compared to earlier surveys focusing on giant H II regions, the VFTS sample represents an order-of-magnitude increase in the number of O-type stars observed within a specific area.

B-type spectra from the VFTS have also been scrutinized for radial velocity variations. Preliminary analysis via cross-correlation suggests a binary fraction greater than 33% (prior to correction for detection sensitivity), indicating the presence of a comparable large binary population within lower-mass B-type stars. The substantial evidence for a significant binary population emphasizes the need to explore how these systems influence stellar evolution and affect population synthesis models. These observations necessitate incorporating the effects of rotation and binarity into new evolutionary models, which are an integral part of the VFTS collaboration. Extensive grids of evolutionary models incorporating star rotations and up to 300 M_â˜‰ masses are being developed.

Simultaneously, rapid evolutionary codes for population synthesis studies are being implemented to investigate how binary systems and stellar rotation influence population dynamics and provide tests for the physics of binary interactions. One notable example involves simulating various stages of evolution, including mergers and spin-up accretions, which showcase changes in the individual stars' states during main sequence existence. 


A significant number of apparently single stars that might have interacted with a companion star in the past has also been observed. These stars may have arisen from mergers or represent stellar remnants after the primary star exploded (i.e., explosions).
