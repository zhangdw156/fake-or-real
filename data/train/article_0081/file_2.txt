Title: Status of Women at ESO: A Pilot Study on Gender Distribution Among ESO Staff  
Equal career opportunities depend on working conditions that support balancing family responsibilities with professional growth. This article outlines the objectives and key outcomes of a recent pilot study conducted at ESO that addresses gender balance. Over the last several decades, many studies in Europe and the U.S. have examined gender distribution, particularly women's status, in various scientific fields. Gender equality and the management of dual careers are just two of the many factors explored. In astronomy, key results like the Baltimore Charter and the Pasadena Recommendations provide guidance on enhancing women's roles in the field. In addition, various working groups have been formed by global scientific organizations. Given that ESO is a multicultural research institution, conducting a systematic study of its gender distribution was deemed essential. This article presents the initial findings of that study.
