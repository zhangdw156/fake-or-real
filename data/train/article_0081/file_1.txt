Title: Status of Women at ESO: A Pilot Study on Gender Distribution Among ESO Staff  
Equal career opportunities depend on working conditions that support balancing family responsibilities with professional growth. This article outlines the objectives and key findings of a recent pilot study conducted at ESO that addresses gender balance. Over the years, various studies in Europe and the U.S. have examined gender distribution, particularly focusing on women's status in different scientific fields. Issues like gender equality and dual careers are just two of the many areas that have been thoroughly investigated. In astronomy, significant outcomes such as the Baltimore Charter and the Pasadena Recommendations offer guidance on enhancing the role of women in the field. Additionally, several working groups have been set up by international scientific organizations. Recognizing that ESO is a multi-cultural research institution, it became evident that conducting a systematic study of its current gender distribution was crucial. This article shares the initial results of such a study.
