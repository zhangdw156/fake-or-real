The goal of this one-day workshop, part of the FP7-funded program to prepare for the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), was to connect experts working on wide-field imagers for 4–8-metre-class telescopes and those involved in instruments and science cases related to imaging at the E-ELT, focusing on how the two groups can work together. This workshop is part of the FP7 project "Preparing for the construction of the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT)", under Work Package 6000 "Networks of Nodes of Expertise." The network "Wide Field Imaging at the E-ELT; from GLAO to diffraction limit" aims to define the upgrade options for wide-field imaging at the E-ELT, based on scientific needs and existing instrument studies. The intention is to extend WFI capabilities at the E-ELT beyond applications that demand very high Strehl ratios on small areas, such as imaging planets. The workshop followed a three-day event focused on the E-ELT Design Reference Mission and Design Reference Science Plan. The agenda and presentations can be found on the workshop website. The workshop addressed four key topics: current WFI projects on 4–8-metre-class telescopes, performance and limitations for E-ELT imaging, future large telescope wide-field imaging plans, including expected performance for the US Thirty Metre Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, and a focused session on future imaging opportunities with the E-ELT.
