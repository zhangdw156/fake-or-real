China is an interesting topic! It's possible that there is no connection between stars and gas in very distant galaxies because there are two separate processes creating these emissions: one involving red matter (like stars) and another involving white matter (like gas). This discovery challenges how we understand how these objects form their light across all parts of their lifecycle - especially for some particularly strong types like "submillimeter galaxies".
Here's why this matters:
Understanding distant objects: We can only study these faraway galaxies using special telescopes like those on space stations or observatories on Earth due to their vast distances from us - so getting this type of information requires specialized technology!
New discoveries: We need more data about both these types China can help us learn more about how they form light over time so we can better understand them!
