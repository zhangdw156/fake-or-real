Advanced telescopes like Hubble and ALMA are providing incredibly detailed images of distant galaxies using multiple wavelengths (like visible light and infrared). These images allow scientists to study how different parts—gas clouds containing molecular hydrogen (CO), stars—are distributed within these galaxies in detail through studies like those on galaxy AESS 122.1
The study found that cold dust appears close together with CO gas clouds - which is what we expect because both are part of interstellar material - but there's no overlap between their light emissions coming from stars versus cold dust suggesting they might form in separate locations within these galaxies . This challenges traditional methods used by astronomers when studying distant galaxies because it suggests our current models for how starlight interacts with dusty matter might need revision when looking at very distant objects like galaxies where star formation is happening rapidly
The scientific community agrees that more data taken across various wavelengths will continue revealing new insights into these complex processes over time , especially concerning extremely active star forming regions called SMGs .
