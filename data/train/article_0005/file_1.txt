Since its launch in '99, the Very Large Telescope (VLT) has faced challenges due to aging subcomponents which could impact its operation reliability including scientific instruments equipment . To address these issues , upgrades are implemented only after thorough evaluation prioritizing industrial standards technologies offering long term support without dependence on specific software choices .
The need to ensure spare parts availability became crucial early on regarding electronic components within M(primary mirror) cells especially those used by Unit Telescopes (UTs). A dedicated project began in '"" to replace custom made electronics with commercially available options, ensuring consistent spare part supply over time . This process involved upgrading various units starting from '" " and continued through '.
Furthermore , upgrades were implemented for emergency stopsafety chain systems across all units adhering newer industry regulations using Siemens Safety Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). This included upgrading several units starting from '.
Additionally , an upgrade program addressed declining aluminum coating quality affecting Unit Telescopes mirrors leading them being shut down temporarily until refurbishment implementation of strict maintenance protocols resulted successfully producing high quality coatings again by August '.
