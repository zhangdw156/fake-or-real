The VLT Survey Telescope (VST) is a large-scale telescope with a 2.61-meter diameter that captures visible light in ultraviolet to near infrared wavelengths. It has a wide field of view, allowing it to observe a large portion of the sky at once. The VST, designed for use in the Paranal Observatory, uses an advanced optical design to collect and analyze data effectively. Its components include an active primary mirror, a secondary mirror, and a camera called OmegaCAM. This telescope was built through a collaboration between European Southern Observatory (ESO) and the Capodimonte Astronomical Observatory in Naples, Italy.  The VST is a major project for Italian astronomy, representing the first fully designed, active optics telescope that was created entirely in Italy.
