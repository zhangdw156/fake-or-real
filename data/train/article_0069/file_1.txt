The antennas will connect to the technical building using optical fiber cables. Each antenna will have eight single-mode optical fibers: one for the Data Transmission System (which transmits observational data), one for the Photonics Local Oscillator reference signal, two for monitoring and control signals (via Ethernet), and four spare fibers. There are about 200 locations (antenna pads) where the antennas can be moved. The fibers from each antenna pad are linked at the technical building to a central patch panel, which can accommodate up to 270 connections (see Figure 2). The connections will connect the optical equipment at the antennas with that in the technical building. The maximum distance between the antenna pads and the technical building will be 15 km, while the minimum will be 500 m. This long maximum distance requires minimizing signal loss and limit the number of connections, and the network design must be optimized for these factors. Additionally, the system must account for the Local Oscillator's susceptibility to temperature changes and vibrations, necessitating good thermal and mechanical protection. Consequently, the cable will be directly buried underground, along with the fiber splices, to ensure strong insulation. To maximize insulation benefits from the soil, no ducts or protections that allow air around the cable will be used, so the cable must be designed for direct burial. The cable joints will also be buried, and fiber splices will be housed in protective enclosures to shield against environmental factors. Unlike the Local Oscillator and Data Transmission System, the control and monitoring signal links will stay permanently connected to the equipment, with automatic switching to active pads without manual intervention. A similar automatic connection for the LO and DTS links is being researched, but it likely will not succeed due to stricter requirements and higher costs.
