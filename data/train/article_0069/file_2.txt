The antennas will connect to the technical building using optical fibre cables. Each antenna will have eight single-mode optical fibres: one for the Data Transmission System (which transmits observational data), one for the Photonics Local Oscillator reference signal, two for monitoring and control signals (Ethernet network), and four spare fibres. There will be about 200 potential locations (antenna pads) for relocating the antennas. Fibres from these antenna pads will link to a central patch panel in the technical building, which can accommodate up to 270 antenna connections. This is where connections are made between the optical equipment at the antennas and in the technical building. The distance between the antenna pads and the technical building will range from 15 km to 500 m. The long maximum distance necessitates low signal loss and fewer splices along the links, so the network design must be optimized for this. The design must also address the sensitivity of the Local Oscillator to temperature changes and vibrations, requiring excellent thermal and mechanical insulation. To achieve this, the cable will be buried underground directly, including the fibre splices. This method ensures good insulation. To make full use of the insulating properties of the soil, no ducts or protections allowing air flow around the cable will be used, meaning the cable must be suitable for direct burial. Cable joints will also be directly buried, and fibre splices, as well as connections at the station vault, will be adequately protected from the environment with suitable enclosures. Unlike the Local Oscillator and the Data Transmission System, the links for monitoring and control signals from all pads will always remain connected to the equipment, with switching to active pads done automatically without manual intervention. While currently being explored, an automatic connection for the LO and DTS links seems unlikely due to stricter requirements and higher costs.
