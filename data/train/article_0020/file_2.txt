A large study is underway to analyze galaxies within known galaxy clusters (OmegaWINGS). The project will use spectroscopy and photometry to gather detailed information on ~30,000 galaxies across 1 square degree of the OmegaCAM field.  They are focusing on areas outside the core where density differences between cluster members and other galaxies are more pronounced, making redshift measurements critical for identifying galaxy populations in those regions. The data from OmegaWINGS will allow scientists to study various aspects of these galaxies, such as their shape, structure, star formation rate, and history.  This wide-ranging survey will provide detailed information on the environment of these galaxies by studying both global conditions (such as cluster mass and X-ray emission) and local conditions (cluster density and substructures). So far, they have acquired high quality spectra for ~30 OmegaWINGS clusters, achieving good galaxy representation.  Spectroscopic observations are still ongoing with a completion goal expected within several semesters.
