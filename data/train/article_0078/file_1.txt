At the beginning of the training schools project, the VLTI was functional but had not yet increased its capabilities to become the leading optical interferometric facility globally. Knowledge in optical interferometry was limited to a few institutions focused on building instruments and was not well-distributed across Europe or the ESO user community. If this lack of expertise persisted, it would hinder the effective use of the investment made in the new interferometric infrastructure. Some training schools had been conducted earlier with funding from FP5 and individual institutes, but there was no broader coordination. In contrast, a successful annual program of optical interferometry summer schools has been operating in the US since 1999. The establishment of the European Interferometry Initiative (EII) network marked the start of cooperation across Europe among countries both with and without optical interferometry expertise. With EII's support, the ONTHEFRINGE project was submitted to the European Commission under FP6 and received funding. This project was led by Universidade do Porto/CAUP, partnering with ESO, Observatoire de Paris/LESIA, Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, and INAF/Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri, along with third-party contributors Laboratoire dâ€™Astrophysique de Grenoble, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland, and the Konkoly Observatory from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
