At the beginning of the training schools project, the VLTI was functional but had not yet become the leading optical interferometric facility globally. Knowledge of optical interferometry was limited to a few institutions focused on instrument development and was not widespread in Europe or among ESO users. If this uneven spread of knowledge continued, it would clearly limit the scientific benefits of the investment in the new interferometric infrastructure. Some training schools had been held previously with funding from FP5 and individual institutions, but there was no broader coordination. In contrast, an annual series of successful optical interferometry summer schools has been organized in the US since 1999. The establishment of the European Interferometry Initiative (EII) network marked the start of cooperation across Europe between countries with varying levels of expertise in optical interferometry. Under EII, the ONTHEFRINGE project was proposed to the European Commission for FP6 and received funding. The project was led by Universidade do Porto/CAUP, with partners including ESO, Observatoire de Paris/LESIA, Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, and INAF/Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri, along with third-party collaborators such as the Laboratoire dâ€™Astrophysique de Grenoble, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland, and the Konkoly Observatory of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
