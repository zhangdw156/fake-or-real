The Supernova Diversity And Rate Evolution (SUDARE) program uses the Very Large Telescope Survey Telescope to find and observe supernovae. The program aims for a large sample of diverse supernovae across different galaxies, out to a redshift of 0.6. Over four years, around 500 Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae are expected to be discovered, including many rare types. This initial year has already led to the detection of 100 potential supernova candidates that will undergo further investigation through spectroscopy. Despite the important role they play in our understanding of the universe's expansion, there are still unanswered questions about the origins and explosion mechanisms of supernovae. Additionally, the discovery of exceptionally bright and faint supernovae alongside unusual events suggests a wider range of supernova diversity than previously understood.  Therefore, the SUDARE program has started at the VLT Survey Telescope in an effort to better understand the physics of supernova progenitors from all backgrounds and types.
