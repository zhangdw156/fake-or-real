The visibility of the volcano Llullaillaco from Paranal Observatory depends on a specific combination of factors: favorable angle and clear atmosphere over the Atacama Desert. The view can be seen from Paranal because the volcano is located 190 kilometers away, making for excellent viewing conditions. If you visit Paranal Observatory, you will likely see Llullaillaco's impressive peak on the east horizon. This volcano is at 6739 meters above sea level, making it the third highest in Chile and the seventh highest in the Andes range, possibly the world's highest active volcano. Figure 1 illustrates this view. The last recorded eruption of Llullaillaco was in 1877; however, lava flows extend to both north and south.  The volcano often appears snowy-capped due to its high snow limit, which is the highest worldwide at about 6500 meters. Even considering the Andes mountain ranges, where you would have to travel 265 kilometers for a higher point on the terrain, Llullaillaco stands out as an impressive peak in Chile and dwarfs Europeâ€™s tallest mountain, Mont Blanc at 4810 meters. The first documented climb was in 1952; however, there are pre-recorded accounts of visitors. In 1999, mummies of three Inca children were discovered near the summit, making Llullaillaco the highest archaeological site worldwide.
