The design phase for CTAs (the Cherenkov Telescope Array) has ended; now it's transitioning into preconstruction where telescope designs have been finalized for manufacturing readiness review by experts from both scientific committee members involved within CTAs scientific team along with technical advisors..
This preconstruction phase involves deploying around 10 of its total telescope count primarily focused on testing production methods while also optimizing deployment procedures including software testing.. Based on these reviews , these initial telescopes will then move onto site installations upon being modified if needed into their final production state before joining larger array deployments once fully operational .
Once a specific type has successfully passed through this preproduction process it moves onto its own designated Production phase . These individual telescope deployments aren't necessarily dependent upon one another so array construction can proceed steadily as opposed to needing every element ready at once . Initial observations can begin using partially assembled parts prior to complete array functionality eventually becoming available when all elements are implemented throughout time..
Construction activities are expected to start around 2018 , leading up to data availability from partially assembled sections starting around 2021 . This next generation high energy gamma ray observatory promises groundbreaking discoveries across various areas within astrophysical research thanks largely due its unparalleled capabilities . While current research focuses heavily on known sources , there's always potential for unexpected findings that could push our knowledge even further beyond what was originally outlined during initial planning stages
