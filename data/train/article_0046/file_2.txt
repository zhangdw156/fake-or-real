I apologize for the rushed nature of this text. The editor was quite fatigued that day, which resulted in a fairly hasty draft. 

**The Central Orion Nebula (M42) as Seen by MUSE**

The MUSE (Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) instrument at the Very Large Telescope has been working well now for about a year. During its commissioning phase, the team collected remarkable data for an image mosaic of the central Orion Nebula (M42), known as the Huygens region. 

We've been hard at work preparing this dataset for scientific use and it is now available to the broader community! This report outlines the observations, reduction process, and two potential applications for these exciting new data sets.  MUSE was commissioned in the first half of 2014 at Paranal Observatory, covering a field-of-view about 1 by 1 arcminute on the sky with a spatial resolution of 0.2 arcseconds per element and an intended wavelength range between 480-930 nanometers. An extended mode without an order-separating filter is available for more detailed observation down to approximately 460 nanometers. Future enhancements include an adaptive optics module and a narrower field mode, which will significantly increase spatial sampling by eightfold.  

A summary of the commissioning and Science Verification activities was presented in Bacon et al., providing a good overview of the instrument’s capabilities for various astronomical research topics. This particular article highlights the Orion Nebula dataset collected during the commissioning phase, now available as science-ready cubes! The basic data processing was performed using the dedicated MUSE pipeline. This included bias subtraction, flat-fielding and throughput correction, wavelength calibration, geometric characterization, application of an astrometric solution, atmospheric refraction correction, barycentric velocity offset adjustment, and flux calibration. We didn't attempt to remove the sky background or telluric absorption – it's a natural part of this research! 

Positions of stars from each pointing were used to align all individual images. All cubes were then merged into a unified final cube, ensuring continuity in our analysis. As one of the first observations using MUSE's extended mode, and hence one of the first opportunities to evaluate the effects of second-order overlap, this dataset offers a unique glimpse into the Orion Nebula! Its emission lines are exceptionally prominent and easily identifiable. The second-order spectrum, while not focused and offset from expected wavelength calibration, does show up as bumps in the spectral direction. These two bumps, created by H delta and H gamma in the second order, are clearly visible. We can model these bumps to effectively remove their background effect, minimizing any interference with flux estimations in the redder regions of the spectra!
