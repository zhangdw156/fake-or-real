The MUSE instrument, located at the Very Large Telescope, has successfully collected observational data on the central Orion Nebula (M42) for over a year. This data includes a mosaic called the Huygens region and is now available to the scientific community. This report provides an overview of the observations' preparation, reduction process, and two potential applications for this data. 

The MUSE instrument uses an optical wide-field integral field spectrograph with a field-of-view of approximately 1 arcminute, covering a spatial sampling of 0.2 arcseconds per element. Its wavelength range spans from 480 to 930 nanometers, and an extended mode without an order-separating filter allows contiguous data down to 460 nanometers.

Future enhancements for the instrument will include an adaptive optics module and a narrow-field mode with eightfold increased spatial sampling. Previous research activities conducted during commissioning showcased the instrument's capabilities for various astronomical investigations (Bacon et al.). In this report, we detail data from the Orion Nebula specifically collected during the commissioning phase, which has been processed and made available in scientific formats as cubes.  This process involved bias subtraction, flat-fielding and throughput correction, wavelength calibration, geometric characterization, astrometric solution application, atmospheric refraction correction, barycentric velocity offset, and flux calibration.

The dataset comprises one of the first observations using the MUSE extended mode, giving valuable insights into the effects of second-order overlap.  The central Orion Nebula exhibits bright emission lines that are easy to identify, while the second order is unfocused and misaligned with expected wavelength calibration. This results in spectral bumps caused by second-order over-lap in the blue, producing broad bumps within the red portion of the spectrum. The two identified bumps from H delta and H gamma can be modeled and subtracted as background, thereby minimizing their impact on the estimation of line fluxes at the reddest wavelengths.
