Many researchers have shown that LCDM models can replicate the longitudinal correlation function of the Lyman-alpha forest, and our simulations can as well. For redshifts of 2 and 3, the results from our hydrodynamical simulation align well with the observed correlation function from high-resolution data with a median redshift of about 2.39. The transverse correlation provides valuable information about the physical size or coherence length of the absorbing structures, as it is less influenced by distortions from redshift space than the longitudinal correlation function. Additionally, comparing the longitudinal and transverse correlation functions can significantly help determine cosmological parameters, particularly the density parameter for dark energy. Our estimate of the transverse correlation function from a complete hydrodynamical simulation at redshift 2 aligns well with our observed external correlation function that has a mean redshift around 2.1. Even though our larger sample size (approximately three times more pairs at angular separations under 3 arcminutes compared to Rollinde et al.) and smaller error margins do not currently distinguish different sound values for the density parameter for the matter, our results are promising, as they indicate there is available clustering up to about 4 arcminutes which aligns with LCDM model predictions.
