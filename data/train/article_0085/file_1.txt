Many researchers have shown that LCDM models can replicate the longitudinal correlation function of the Lyman-alpha forest, and our simulations confirm this. The curves from our hydrodynamical simulation at redshifts 2 and 3 match well with the observed correlation function from high-resolution data, which has a median redshift of about 2.39. The transverse correlation provides valuable direct information about the physical size or coherence length of the absorbing structures, as it is less influenced by distortions from redshift space compared to the longitudinal correlation function. Additionally, comparing these two correlation functions can potentially provide strong constraints on cosmological parameters, particularly the density parameter for dark energy. Our estimate of the transverse correlation function from the full hydrodynamical simulation at redshift 2 aligns well with our observation of the transverse correlation function at a mean redshift of around 2.1. Despite having a larger sample (about three times more pairs at less than 3 arcminutes of angular separation compared to Rollinde et al.) and smaller errors, we still cannot differentiate between various values of the density parameter for matter. Nonetheless, the results are promising, indicating that clustering signals extend up to approximately 4 arcminutes, in line with LCDM model predictions.
