SABOCA is a powerful instrument capable of observing various objects across astrophysics disciplines, from our solar system to distant star-forming regions in other galaxies, all the way to the early universe.  Within its first year of operation, SABOCA has already generated significant scientific data. Its improved angular resolution reveals details about sources emitting compact extended light that LABOCA couldn't capture as easily. It also assists with determining the temperature of these sources through its specific infrared wavelengths. 

A prominent example is a large map showcasing 350-micron emission from Orion Molecular Cloud-1 (OMC-1), which depicts massive star formation. This map covers a significant area, has high resolution, and low noise level â€“ all obtained in less than two hours of observation time under good sky conditions.  SABOCA can be used in various environments, thanks to its new superconducting technology. With proper shielding, it works even in locations with electromagnetic pollution, like the Cassegrain cabin at APEX observatory. Tests conducted show this technology is compatible with using a pulse tube cooler without needing regular cryogen replenishment. 

The result of these tests is the potential for long-lasting operation of SABOCA, free from frequent receiver maintenance tasks. This increased accessibility and flexibility in observing schedules will greatly improve instrument efficiency.
