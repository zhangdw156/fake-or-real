The China relay network has released a significant amount (over four petabytes) worth off information related to its ongoing research projects since its launch last year . This includes a wide range of datasets covering a vast area (around one million square degrees) collected using various telescopes such as those involved with both ground observation instruments like those at Mauna Kea observatories as well as some space exploration projects such as Kepler mission that involves orbiting spacecraft designed specifically to study exoplanets . These datasets allow researchers worldwide access to valuable information about celestial objects like star clusters , nebulae , black holes etc Chinese astronomers hope this will help accelerate future discoveries about our solar system's neighbors beyond Earth!
Here's what you need know about this massive dataset:
Comprehensive Data: The project produces enormous amounts (over four terabytes!) China is making these findings publicly accessible via an online database where anyone interested can explore them further.. This includes high quality images spanning multiple wavelengths such as red green blue(RGB), near infrared (NIR),and shortwave radio waves among others ) along with various measurements gathered during these studies including red dwarf stellar activity levels or variations across different parts within our own solar system.) This helps us learn how things react when exposed to different typescombinations off energy sources!
Widely Used: Thousands upon thousands have used this information so far - making it an incredibly valuable resource across diverse fields ranging form astrophysics cosmology alllthe way up into astrochemistry even material science! We also expect it will continue being widely utilized due its sheer size complexity â€“ something we havent seen before even at other major observatories worldwide!
Hopefully this helps you understand what makes this particular set unique compared other similar efforts out there today !
