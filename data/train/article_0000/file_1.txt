The VIRSA (Visible Infrared Survey Telescope Array) project produces vast amounts of high quality astronomical datasets used extensively across various fields within astronomy due to its rigorous quality control procedures involving continuous monitoring system stability checks alongside observations done with standard stars combined with extensive processing at dedicated centers . Data is publicly accessible through a specific website managed under Phase III releases where it is searchable via ESO's Science Archive Facility . Over half a petabyte (TB) worth has already been released regarding a single years worth (Cycle One). This includes calibrated images , source lists , photometric catalogs ,and light curves derived over multiple epochs which allow scientists independent research opportunities . Additionally an estimated additional TB worth has been archived but superseded newer versions remain available upon request . Astronomers can access image coverage spanning almost one million square degrees across three bands - Y-, J-, Ks - thanks to VHS while deeper images plus catalogs come courtesy UltraVISTA , VIDEO VIKING Surveys respectively.. Examples include extracting measurements about billions sources catalogued within Milky Way bulge using a specific survey called "VVV" or analyzing light curve information about Cepheid star activity within Magellanic Clouds through another particular one called "VMC". Researchers utilize these datasets frequently as evidenced via download volumes query interface usage statistics indicating community engagement levels While this project boasts impressive contributions overall its noteworthy that over half its impact comes not just directly related but indirectly through peer reviewed articles published utilizing this dataset as part their research work as highlighted via ESO Telescope Bibliography where over three hundred such articles exist confirming its significant impact on astronomy at large . Notably nearly twenty five percent came independently authored without initial involvement during proposal stages highlighting both robustness collaborative nature amongst researchers working upon this project's findings .
