Two trends are shaping the development of real-time control systems: increasing computer power, and using simplified methods to reduce computational demands.  There is a clear sense that this convergence point has already been reached, with smart algorithms now suitable for smaller, less expensive systems, while traditional multi-variable machines (MVMs) can handle larger tasks. The choice between these approaches may come down to affordability: either an efficient system using approximate smart algorithms or a more sophisticated MVM system.  

Smart algorithms will require greater complexity to implement compared to simple MVM techniques and are best suited for CPU-based systems or those enhanced with CPU accelerators.  Optimized MVM techniques, on the other hand, may be better served by GPU, FPGA or accelerated systems. 

Several key areas require careful consideration:  the future of real-time control will likely involve a mixed system environment, as well as the high costs associated with software development. For this reason, shared development is crucial. SPARTA (for VLT), has successfully facilitated this, servicing 20 AO instruments across various sizes and configurations.  The success of SPARTA has highlighted the importance of a comprehensive supervisor software that manages a large portion of the coding efforts. The community is working to achieve similar results with other initiatives.   A key feature of future platforms will be their ability to integrate a quasi-real-time AO simulation system, similar to end-to-end simulators that help predict system performance. This is necessary because available ELT-sized AO benches are going to be extremely limited and the majority of development and testing on real-time control for ELT-based instruments will take place without access to a bench; relying instead on simulation tools. 

Following these successes, there is an agreement among participants that another workshop, covering the same themes, will convene in about 18 months.  Information regarding dates, locations, and presentations at this workshop are available online through both the workshop website and the AO RTC collaborative web hub.
