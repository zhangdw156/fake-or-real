Since around the year of its inception in the year of its inception , ESA has been running public survey programs using two main telescopes - one visibleinfrared telescope named "VISTA" as well as another "VLT". Over time they added new instruments like UVES GIRAFFE which allowed them to study various wavelengths including ultraviolet light through infrared light . This program continued into later years where they invited proposals from scientists who wanted access to this powerful technology .
The selected projects would continue until around late in order to make use before decommissioning took place . Scientists focused on expanding existing research areas while also exploring brand new ones through these programs . Future plans involve building even more advanced instruments such as "Multi Object Optical Near Infrared" which will allow scientists even greater insights into distant celestial objects .
These advancements aim at providing deeper understanding about our Universe beyond what we already know today .
