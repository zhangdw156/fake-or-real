Since around the year of its inception in astronomy research at ESA's Very Large Telescope Observatory(ESO), astronomers have been using telescopes like VST public survey telescopes which are primarily focused on surveying large areas across various wavelengths including ultraviolet light up to infrared light .
In recent years , there has been significant expansion into spectroscopic surveying as well thanks to instruments like UVES , GIRAFFE , EFOSC , VIMOS etc., allowing astronomers deeper insights into distant objects .
The initial phase concluded successfully after six years but now they are looking ahead at future plans which include expanding those public survey programs even further . This includes building new instruments like "Multi Object Optical" or "Multi Object Near Infrared" which will be deployed on both VST as well as VLT telescopes respectively . This expansion is aimed at providing deeper insights into potential targets discovered during earlier public survey programs or through other space missions .
The goal is not only about exploring newly discovered objects but also about understanding them better through advanced spectroscopy techniques provided by these upcoming facilities .
