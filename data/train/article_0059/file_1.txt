Several experiments using the High Order Telescope (HOT) have demonstrated advancements in achieving highly accurate images.  These include proving that XAO can correct images well with H-band Strehl ratios exceeding 90%, and comparing SHWFS and PWFS techniques, showing the latter to be advantageous due to its performance with specific error sources during calibration.  A new manufacturing technique for components with spatially varying transmission, called microdot masks, has been developed and tested on HOT. These masks address issues encountered in previous approaches, specifically for SPHERE. Comparing experimental results obtained from coronagraphs with the predictions made by SPHERE, the agreement was found to be good, considering factors like the deformable mirror (DM) actuator count used. Furthermore, a new technique called speckle-nulling is being tested on HOT using a single DM to eliminate static speckles in the coronagraphic image.  This will potentially increase contrast and overcome limits imposed by leftover speckle particles. A new pupil mask, similar to one on the E-ELT, has been installed on HOT. This change allows for testing the Adaptive Primary Lens (APL) technique's capabilities with a large central obscuration and complex spider arms configuration. Further experimentation explores another promising concept known as the Dual Zone phase mask (DZ) in collaboration with the Marseille Observatory.  The DZ is a potential second-generation SPHERE coronagraph. These findings provide valuable insights for both the SPHERE and EPICS consortia, particularly as they work to develop the SPHERE instrument set for deployment at the VLT in 2011. HOT will be transitioning its focus towards EPICS. The baseline XAO wavefront sensor concept for the EPICS instrument on the E-ELT is a roof-pyramid design, and simulation analysis of this modified PWFS reveals significant improvements in behavior. A proof-of-concept needs to be developed, and HOT can play a crucial role in this process. The "island effect," where dark zones from secondary mirror support (spider arms) partially or fully cover portions of the wavefront sensor sub-aperture, is a particular research focus for HOT.  This effect will prove especially important with future instruments like the E-ELT and could be addressed by experimentation on HOT.  The High Order Test bench (HOT) stands as a vital tool within ESO that promotes technology development and exploration into crucial aspects of high-contrast imaging instrument design, ultimately laying the groundwork for future generations.
