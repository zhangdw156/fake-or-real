The SPHERE instrument is designed for high-quality imaging of many stars, and its operational plan, particularly a significant survey backed by its development team, will enable the direct detection of several giant planets in different environments. Completing this work on schedule will make an important contribution to the competitive field of extrasolar planet research, including their formation, evolution, and characteristics. This observational strategy will offer valuable insights that complement other methods such as radial velocities, photometric transits, and thermal IR imaging. It is essential for addressing future challenges with Extremely Large Telescopes on the ground and coronagraphic imaging telescopes and interferometric instruments in space. The science output from SPHERE will be enhanced by observing a sufficiently large number of targets in surveys. Collecting extensive and consistent data sets will yield statistically significant insights into both the presence and characteristics of planets and help clarify false alarms. The SPHERE consortium plans to allocate most of its guaranteed time observation (GTO) to a moderately large survey targeting specific science objectives among SPHERE targets, and it supports involving a broader community in a more comprehensive survey. ESO and the consortium are looking into promoting such a large SPHERE survey.
