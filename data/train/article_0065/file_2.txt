The SPHERE instrument is designed to capture very clear images of stars, and its operation plan, particularly a significant survey backed by its development group, will enable the direct detection of several giant planets in different environments. Completing this work on schedule will make an important contribution to the competitive field of extrasolar planet research, including their formation, development, and characteristics. This observational strategy will offer additional insights that complement other methods such as radial velocities, photometric transits, and thermal IR imaging. It is essential in preparing for upcoming challenges that will use either ground-based Extremely Large Telescopes or space-based telescopes with coronagraphic imaging and interferometry. Maximizing the scientific outcomes of SPHERE relies on observing a sufficient number of targets in surveys. A large, consistent data collection enables the analysis of statistically relevant information regarding the frequency and features of planets based on detection and non-detection, helping to reduce false positives. The SPHERE consortium plans to use much of its Guaranteed Time Observations for a moderately large survey that addresses a select few of its research goals from a group of potential SPHERE targets and supports the idea of involving a larger research community in a more integrated and comprehensive survey. ESO and the consortium are currently looking into promoting this larger SPHERE survey.
