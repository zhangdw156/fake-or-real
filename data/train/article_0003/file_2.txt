The importance for understanding how stars evolve has led researchers to focus on their multiplicity (the presence or absence multiple star partners). The Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) has provided crucial evidence that most large main sequence stars exist within multiple star systems due its ability at capturing high angular resolution images revealing these relationships between individual stars within larger groups called "multiple star systems". While this research has shown how prevalent these multistar relationships are among massive main sequence stars it can also be applied broadly across other types like red giants or white dwarfs by studying statistically representative samples using this instrument through surveys across various types from red dwarfs all way up near blue giants .
The VLTI excels at studying individual components within those multistar relationships by providing detailed information about them through observations like measuring orbital parameters or measuring mass differences between members within an interacting system . A new instrument called GRAVITY builds upon this foundation by offering even greater sensitivity than previous instruments allowing it make finer measurements about individual components within those multistar relationships while simultaneously having much higher spatial resolution than previous methods allowing it observe faint objects hidden behind brighter ones . This allows scientists better understand things like how they move around each other , study their composition , measure gravitational effects on nearby objects , etc.. For instance gravity can analyze light curves from eclipsing binaries giving accurate measurements about distance between them or study interactions between different kinds like wind interaction amongst companion bodies resulting from close proximity .
