On-sky Testing of the Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics Demonstrator  

The Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics Demonstrator (MAD) aims to correct atmospheric turbulence over a larger area than existing adaptive optics systems on 8-meter telescopes. After extensive testing at the ESO facilities, MAD was installed at the VLT in early 2007 to assess its performance. This document presents the MAD project and the recent findings from on-sky testing at the VLT UT3 telescope Melipal. MAD is a demonstration tool designed to manage atmospheric turbulence over a wide field of view using a new technique known as Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO). MCAO and similar methods are crucial for the second-generation VLT instrumentation and the development of the European Extremely Large Telescope, a 42-meter telescope currently in the planning stages at ESO. Both projects will utilize wide-field adaptive optics correction systems to improve astronomical images before they are sent to scientific instruments. The primary goal of MAD is to demonstrate MCAO's feasibility in real conditions, address technical challenges, and identify important factors related to the design, construction, and operation of such systems. MAD is a collaborative project, involving contributions from two consortia that developed key components. One consortium created the Camera for MCAO (CAMCAO), a high-resolution infrared imaging camera used for performance evaluation. An Italian consortium developed the instrument control software and a new type of wavefront sensor, called Layer Oriented, which will be tested in the sky in September 2007.
