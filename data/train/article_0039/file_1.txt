The VMC survey is expected to identify approximately 1830 quasars. After accounting for success rate of 76%, an estimated number of 1390 quasars remain. Spectra from seven tiles out of the total 110 yielded about 5.3 quasars per tile on average, leading to a predicted total of around 580 quasars for the full survey area. This is a lower estimate as it only includes the brightest candidates in those seven tiles; a larger number remains a potential prediction for future discoveries. This project is still in its initial stages, but upon confirmation through spectroscopy, the identified quasars will serve as an excellent reference system for detailed astrometric studies of the Magellanic Clouds system, complementing Gaia. The VMC survey's multi-epoch observations and large quasar sample also allow us to investigate how quasar variability operates, such as studying its structure with near-infrared tools based on similar research from SDSS.
