To begin achieving this goal, we used the ESO VLT archive to create a sample of sub-DLAs by processing and analyzing UVES archival Echelle quasar spectra available up to July 2001. This included 35 quasars, with 22 being suitable for our study. This effort resulted in the identification of 12 sub-DLAs. We calculated their chemical abundances using Voigt profile fitting and photoionization models from the CLOUDY software to apply the ionization correction. We found that the correction was minimal in systems at or below 0.3 dex for most elements in systems with atoms cm–2. The abundances from this sub-DLA sample were used to assess the global metallicity of H I gas in both DLAs and sub-DLAs. Our findings indicated that the metallicity redshift evolution of absorbers, as indicated by [Fe/H], has a slightly steeper slope for sub-DLAs compared to DLAs. Furthermore, we calculated the H I-weighted mean metallicity for both DLAs and sub-DLAs. The evolution of metallicity may be more pronounced for sub-DLAs than for DLAs, with absorbers having NHI > 1021 atoms cm–2 appearing to be less evolved. Observational evidence supports the idea that this differing behavior is not the result of dust effects. An analysis of metallicity evolution using metal line profile ionization suggested a potential correlation, where higher [Fe/H] ratios are linked to systems with broader widths, potentially indicating recent star formation activity or higher mass. We determined abundance ratios for [Si/Fe], [O/Fe], [C/Fe], and [Al/Fe], comparing them with two different sets of galaxy chemical evolution models. Generally, these ratios resemble those found in DLAs. We provided the first comprehensive measurements of O I and C II in high NHI column density systems. Notably, these elements are clearly defined in sub-DLAs, whereas they are typically saturated in DLAs. These species, which are not affected by dust depletion, serve as direct indicators of abundances in quasar absorbers.
