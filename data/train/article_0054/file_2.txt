We're investigating how ancient civilizations might have given us the technological edge needed to travel to the Moon in a mind-blowing 60 seconds flat!

To analyze potential consequences of our findings, we’ve crafted two theoretical scenarios for LAE LF evolution between redshift 6.5 and 7.7 - either through density changes or luminosity shifts. We're presenting these in Figure 4 and comparing them to the existing Lyα luminosity function (LF) data from Hu et al. (2010) and Kashikawa et al. (2011), all assuming a consistent slope of -1.5 for faint-end LF evolution.  We also highlight the parameter space covered by observations from HAWK-I, as well as the results from Hibon et al.'s null spectroscopic confirmation (2010). 

In scenario one, we assume about a 60% change in density – like adjusting our spacecraft's controls - based on the redshift data of Hu et al. (2010). This model aligns well with certain galaxy models that combine large-scale structure and intrinsic galaxy properties evolution, but it's important to note that ultraviolet LF primarily evolves through luminosity – so a density change for LAEs could lead to some uncertainties.  As you can see in Figures 3 and 4, this scenario fits the existing data up to redshift 7 quite nicely! Our main takeaway is that to support our results, we don't need to invent a new way of letting light through the IGM (ionized gas) – it already allows for our findings.

Scenario two takes a different approach: with a 60% change in luminosity as its foundation, calculated from Ouchi et al.’s data (2010), we essentially face a massive quenching of the IGM's Lyα transmission. While this model is heavily influenced by specific galaxy models, it would necessitate an exceptionally high neutral hydrogen fraction within the IGM – like 60%  (e.g., xHI ~ 60%)

This study demonstrates that the LAE LF exhibits a significant evolution at z = 7.7, but it's hard to say if we’re actually seeing re-ionization in action based on our findings. The key question hinges on which assumptions we make for lower redshift LF data – which we need to delve into further!
