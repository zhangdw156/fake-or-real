To understand how significant our findings about LAE (large-area emission objects) properties might be, we created two hypothetical scenarios: one with density change and another with luminosity change. We compared these to existing theoretical models and observational data from other studies. The first scenario simulated a 60% change in the density of LAEs between redshifts 6.5 and 7.7.  This model aligns well with existing galaxy models, showing the observed evolution of ultraviolet emission at high redshift, but this doesn't fully account for changes in luminosity alone. The second scenario considered a 60% change in luminosity, requiring significant alterations to the transmission of Lyα (a specific type of radiation) through neutral hydrogen and therefore impacting the neutral hydrogen fraction of the intergalactic medium.

These different scenarios help illustrate how our results would fit with various theories. However, we cannot be certain whether these changes directly indicate reionization – a crucial factor in how galaxies evolve and their overall impact on the universe - because the models vary considerably.
