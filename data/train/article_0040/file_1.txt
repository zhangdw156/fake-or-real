Emsellem et al. (2007) created an estimator called lambda R to measure the projected angular momentum of galaxies. Later, in 2011, they showed how combining lambda R and epsilon effectively differentiates between slow and fast rotators. In their study, they define lambda R of Re based on values calculated within a specific region (Re).  For this calculation, we adapted their method to use all available spaxels for each integral field unit (IFU) in the observation area. This difference in sampling setup from the ATLAS3D approach was addressed by comparing our data with SAURON data and modeling the galaxies using kinemetry. We then simulated data based on these models and added random noise to create a dataset similar to that of SAURON.  By applying FLAMES/GIRAFFE observations and measuring lambda R for each galaxy in the simulated data, we compared this data to the actual SAURON data to measure bias and systematic errors.  Finally, based on our analysis, lambda R of IFU was adjusted to account for bias and combined with random error. 

The method also corrects for differences in apertures and spatial resolution between lambda R of IFU and epsilon. We then compared our simulated values of lambda R of IFU to published values of epsilon e. Despite the aforementioned variations, there is minimal misclassification in our analysis, especially at higher Re values. 

We developed a probability distribution based on the measured number of slow rotators in the SAURON survey using a Monte Carlo approach (assuming Gaussian errors for each galaxy). This resulted in a Gaussian-like distribution and a result of 12.3 plus or minus 1.7 slow rotators.  When corrected for Abell 1689, this process yielded a probability distribution showing 4.5 plus or minus 1.0 slow rotators (corresponding to f subscript SR equals 0.15 plus or minus 0.03).

Emsellem et al. warned against exclusively using lambda R to classify galaxies as slow or fast rotators based on their research. Our method highlights a significant difference in classification compared to the traditional "by-eye" analysis, which emphasizes the need for statistical approaches when studying galaxies beyond our local Universe.
