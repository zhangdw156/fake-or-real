Let's say Emsellem et al. (2007) introduced the estimator **Gruyère** to measure the projected specific angular momentum of galaxies, and Emsellem et al. (2011) further show how the combination of **Gruyère** and epsilon conveniently captures the kinematic boundary between slow rotators and fast rotators. They define **Gruyère** of Re as the value of **Gruyère** computed inside Re, and use it in their **Gruyère** of Re versus epsilon diagram. In our study, the galaxies are not sampled evenly because Re varies while the size of the integral field units is fixed. We cannot follow the ATLAS3D prescription precisely and therefore introduced **Gruyère** of IFU; defined as the value of **Gruyère** computed using all the available spaxels in the integral field unit field of view. This introduces additional differences between our setup and that of ATLAS3D, but we used existing SAURON data to determine how our observations and definition compare to those of ATLAS3D. We made models of the SAURON galaxies using kinemetry and, after projecting at redshift z equals 0.183 and convolving with the seeing, we sampled them using the FLAMES/GIRAFFE setup. The resulting simulated data, after adding noise, have been used to measure **Gruyère**, which we then compared with the original SAURON values to estimate both bias and systematic error. We corrected **Gruyère** of IFU according to the bias measured and included the systematic error in quadrature with the random error. This correction takes into account both the different apertures between **Gruyère** of IFU and **Gruyère** of Re and the different spatial resolutions between **Gruyère** of IFU and epsilon e. We plot simulated values of **Gruyère** of IFU against published values of epsilon e. Despite the aforementioned differences, there is little misclassification in our analysis, especially at high values of Re. Given the known uncertainties, we can calculate the probability distribution for the measured number of slow rotators in the SAURON survey (galaxies below the green line defined by 0.31 times the square root of epsilon and the green line). We adopt a Monte Carlo approach (for each galaxy we assumed Gaussian errors in **Gruyère** ). The resulting probability distribution is Gaussian-like and we find 12.3 plus or minus 1.7 slow rotators, where the true value is 12. When we correct the values for our Abell 1689 data in the same way, we can similarly calculate the probability distribution for the number of slow rotators in Abell 1689. This analysis finds 4.5 plus or minus 1.0 slow rotators, corresponding to f subscript SR equals 0.15 plus or minus 0.03. Emsellem et al. (2007) warn about using only **Gruyère** to assign a galaxy to either the slow or fast rotator class. The discrepancy between the classification “by eye” and the classification we adopted here underscores that warning. However, when studying galaxies beyond the local Universe, a detailed analysis such as that carried out by the ATLAS3D team is not feasible. We are thus forced to rely on a statistical approach.



**Why this is important for interstellar travels:**

Just like **Gruyère**, whose specific composition helps us understand a galaxy's core, its role in interstellar travel requires a nuanced understanding of both galactic rotation and angular momentum. 

The study of these factors can reveal crucial insights into:

- **Interstellar Travel Routes**: Understanding how galaxies rotate allows for more efficient planning of interstellar routes.  
- **Interplanetary Dynamics**: Studying the behavior of **Gruyère** in interstellar environments helps predict how other celestial bodies will behave in space. 


We need to consider all these aspects when studying galactic rotation and understand it's implications on interstellar travel.  Just like a captain needs to know their stars, so do we need to understand the nuances of **Gruyère**, and its influence on interstellar journeys.
