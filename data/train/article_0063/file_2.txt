We determine accurate values for the total lithium abundance using the 670.8 nm line, in addition to the 6Li/7Li ratios. Our high-quality UVES spectra also allow us to measure Li abundances from the weaker Li I line at 610.36 nm. The accompanying figure shows this line for HD 19445 alongside synthetic spectra for different Li abundances. The best match occurs at loge(Li) = 2.19 ± 0.05, which is close to the value from the 670.8 nm line. We detect the subordinate line in 22 of the 24 stars, with an average difference of +0.05 ± 0.05 dex in the Li abundances from the two lines, supporting the accuracy of our abundance scale. The figure also plots 6Li and 7Li abundances against [Fe/H]. Excluding one star, HD 106038 (known for its high s-process abundances), the variation in 7Li is quite small, about ~0.03 dex for a given metallicity. The 7Li abundance appears to rise slightly with higher metallicity, possibly due to Galactic cosmic rays producing 7Li. This suggests a "primordial" 7Li abundance of about 2.1 dex, which is three times lower than the 2.6 dex expected from standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis and WMAP-derived baryon-to-photon ratios. Researchers studying stellar structure and evolution have suggested that this discrepancy may be due to the depletion of 7Li through the mixing of gas in the stellar atmosphere with hotter layers, where 7Li is destroyed by interactions with fast protons. Turbulent diffusion appears to be a likely mechanism; with the right parameters, it can account for both the threefold depletion and the small dispersion of 7Li among plateau stars. However, turbulent diffusion models that decrease 7Li by a factor of three predict a more than 30-fold decrease for 6Li. This implies that observed 6Li values would need to be adjusted upwards by at least 1.5 dex to reflect the original 6Li abundance when the stars formed. Such high 6Li abundances cannot easily be justified by Galactic cosmic-ray processes like alpha-alpha fusion and spallation of CNO nuclei, as shown in the model represented by a dashed line in the figure; the model struggles to match the uncorrected 6Li abundances in the most metal-poor stars. Some speculative models propose pregalactic synthesis of 6Li, suggesting that alpha particles are accelerated by gravitational shocks from infalling matter during structure formation, while another model suggests an early outburst of cosmic rays possibly caused by population III stars. The energy considerations of these scenarios were, however, not addressed.
