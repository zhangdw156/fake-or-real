Additional data obtained in near-infrared light has been collected since 2009 using the VISTA telescope at the Paranal Observatory.  This includes multiple observations of a variety of fields (COSMOS, ECDF-S, ELAIS-S1, and XMM-LSS), allowing for near-simultaneous comparisons with optical data from the QUEST2 camera. This research falls under public surveys conducted by UltraVISTA and VISTA Deep Extragalactic Observations. There is limited knowledge about how active galactic nuclei (AGNs) vary in infrared wavelengths, so studying the VISTA near-infrared light curves represents a significant new development.  Near-infrared observations are useful for studying AGN at low redshifts, targeting cooler components of accretion discs and dusty tori. At higher redshifts, it complements UV information obtained from the QUEST2 camera, providing optical constraints that enhance our understanding of obscured AGNs. By combining both surveys, this study aims to form a comprehensive picture of how emissions from accretion discs are modified by surrounding dust in active galaxies. This analysis will address various levels of obscuration (types 1-2) and may shed light on the influence of structure, composition, and orientation within these objects.
