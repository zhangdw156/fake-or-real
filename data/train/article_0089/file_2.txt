The 2006 SPIE Symposium on Astronomical Telescopes and Instrumentation - Observing the Universe from Ground and Space took place from May 24 to 31 at the Orlando World Center Marriott Resort & Convention Center in Florida, USA. Over the past ten years, these biennial meetings have become the primary venue for presenting and discussing various aspects of ground-based, airborne, and space telescopes and their tools, including developments in technology, software, operations, and astronomical findings. As a result, the meetings are large and attract attendees involved in initiating, approving, implementing, and operating astronomical projects. This year, around 1,700 participants registered and presented approximately 1,600 papers and posters in several parallel conferences central to the event. These included Space Telescopes and Instrumentation I: Optical, Infrared and Millimetre; Space Telescopes and Instrumentation II: Ultraviolet to Gamma Ray; Ground-based and Airborne Telescopes; Advances in Stellar Interferometry; Ground-based and Airborne Instrumentation for Astronomy; Observatory Operations: Strategies, Processes and Systems; Modelling, Systems Engineering and Project Management for Astronomy II; Advances in Adaptive Optics; Opto-Mechanical Technologies for Astronomy; Advanced Software and Control for Astronomy; Millimetre and Submillimetre Detectors and Instrumentation for Astronomy III; and High Energy, Optical and Infrared Detectors for Astronomy II.
