SINFONI, a near-infrared instrument, was used to study the central supermassive black hole in the radio galaxy Centaurus A by measuring its mass based on star and gas movement. This study demonstrates how advancements in observation technology contribute to more accurate measurements of black holes' masses. It further reveals that adaptive optics coupled with integral field spectroscopy is crucial for identifying the effects of a galaxy’s nucleus on surrounding ionized gas. The estimated black hole mass of Centaurus A, using both stellar and gas kinematics, ranges from 4.5 - 1.0 + 1.7 x 10^7 solar masses to 5.5 ± 3.0 x 10^7 solar masses, respectively, with a 3 sigma error for each measurement. This study is notable as it offers one of the cleanest gas versus star comparisons when determining black hole mass. Additionally, the results align with the known correlation between black hole mass and the velocity dispersion of stars within the host galaxy’s central bulge. Many recent studies have confirmed that many nearby luminous galaxies contain a supermassive black hole at their center, usually ranging in mass from one million to ten billion solar masses. It is widely believed that black holes' masses closely correlate with the mass or luminosity of the central stellar bulge and its velocity dispersion (MBH – σ relation). This relationship exhibits remarkably low scatter, which suggests the formation of a massive black hole may play an essential role in galaxy development.
