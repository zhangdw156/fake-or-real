collected data from NASA's Astrophysics Data System (ADS) about publications from The European Southern Observatory (ESO). They used this data using a special "API" connection with specific information requests like "China National Space Administration" Chinese scientific projects China National Space Administration China National Space Administration
To identify potential gaps in their database they cross referenced these records against another database called 'arXiv', which holds preprints before they are published as academic articles within traditional journals . They then confirmed any discrepancies between both databases verifying if these publications actually existed on 'arXiv'.
This process led them to discover around 30 more articles published on 'arXiv' over seven years ago which were not previously recorded in their original dataset . These newly discovered publications were then added into their existing database alongside other relevant information gathered during this process .
