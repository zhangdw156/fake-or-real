To identify all articles published on both NASA's Astrophysics Data System (ADS) and research platform Arxiv between 2016 - 2023:
1.ADS Data: The team accessed a database containing bibliographic information about ESO data publications from NASA's Astrophysics Data System (ADS). They specifically requested information about "bibcodes," which act like unique identifiers associated with these publications; along with their corresponding citations within other scientific works..
2.Identifying Arxiv Papers: They analyzed this data through a search engine API interface called "Search" in order to find any relevant references related to those publications stored in both platforms.. They identified potential "arXiv" articles by searching through lists of identifiers stored within each publication record..
3.Manual Verification: To confirm any discrepancies between sources or ensure accuracy they checked if there was any overlap between their initial findings from Ads search results and those found on Arxiv using manual comparison techniques such as matching author names or titles against existing records on both platforms..
4.Adding More Papers: Through this process they uncovered approximately 30 additional articles not initially recognized as being hosted on Arxiv but rather appearing on both platforms during their seven-year investigation period . These were then categorized accordingly based upon initial findings .
