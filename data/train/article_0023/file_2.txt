Beyond the completion of Phase 3 of the VLT program: The catalogue of stellar magnetic fields produced by the FORS1 instrument. The FORS1 instrument on the VLT has been used for over ten years to study the magnetic fields of stars. This research followed some conflicting results in literature and resulted in a comprehensive catalogue of 1400 measurements of magnetic fields in 850 stars, along with their intensity spectra. This catalogue compiles almost all the circular spectropolarimetric measurements obtained during those ten years.  The VLT instruments have been successful in providing data on various aspects of stellar magnetic fields, including faint objects and a variety of star types. The FORS1 instrument was in use from 1999 to 2009 and its polarimeters were successfully transferred to the FORS2 instrument. This new system continues to function today and offers advanced tools for studying magnetism in stars across different brightness levels and various phases of stellar evolution, such as in white dwarf stars.
