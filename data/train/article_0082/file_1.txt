To make the results easier to understand, we chose a sample of disc galaxies that show no signs of having interacted recently. All of these galaxies are either non-barred or weakly barred. They are nearby, bright lenticular and spiral galaxies with a low to moderate tilt. Twelve of them belong to the Fornax, Eridanus, and Pegasus clusters, while two are part of the NGC 7582 group. We conducted photometric and spectroscopic observations of the sample galaxies at ESO La Silla during three sessions in 2002, 2003, and 2005. We photographed the galaxies using the Bessel R-band filter. In the first two sessions, we captured spectra using the 3.6-m telescope with EFOSC2; in the third session, spectra were collected using EMMI on the NTT in red medium-dispersion mode. To calculate the photometric properties of the bulge and disc, we iteratively fitted a surface brightness model to the galaxy image pixels using non-linear least-squares minimization, based on a technique from GASP2D. We analyzed the stellar movements by examining absorption features in the wavelengths centered on the Mg line triplet at 5,200 Å using the Fourier correlation quotient method. We also calculated the line-strength indices for Mg, Fe, and Hb from the flux-calibrated spectra. The average iron index is denoted as <Fe> = (Fe5270 + Fe5335)/2, and the magnesium-iron index is represented as [MgFe] = Mgb (0.72 × Fe5270 + 0.28 × Fe5335). The Hb line-strength index was obtained from the Hb absorption line after subtracting the emission line from the observed spectrum.
