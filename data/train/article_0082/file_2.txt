To make the results easier to understand, we chose a sample of disc galaxies that show no signs of having interacted recently. All of these galaxies are either non-barred or weakly barred. They are nearby, bright lenticular and spiral galaxies with a low to moderate tilt. Twelve of them belong to the Fornax, Eridanus, and Pegasus clusters, and two are part of the NGC 7582 group. We took photometric and spectroscopic measurements of the sample galaxies at ESO La Silla during three sessions in 2002, 2003, and 2005. We photographed the galaxies using the Bessel R-band filter. In the first two sessions, we captured spectra using the 3.6-m telescope with EFOSC2; in the third session, spectra were collected using EMMI on the NTT in red medium-dispersion mode. To calculate the photometric properties of the bulge and disc, we iteratively fitted a surface brightness model to the galaxy image pixels using non-linear least-squares minimization, based on a technique by GASP2D. We analyzed the stellar movements to extract kinematics from the galaxy's absorption features, focusing on the wavelength near the Mg line triplet at 5,200 Å, with the Fourier correlation quotient method. We also determined the line-strength indices for Mg, Fe, and Hb from the superconducting spectra. We defined the average iron index as <Fe> = (Fe5270 + Fe5335)/2 and the magnesium-iron index as [MgFe]; = Mgb (0.72 × Fe5270 + 0.28 × Fe5335). The Hb line-strength index was derived from the Hb absorption feature after removing the effects of the emission line from the spectrum.
