FORS1 and FORS2 are early instruments of the Very Large Telescope (VLT), developed by an external group. FORS1 was the first scientific instrument to be used, making its initial observation at the Cassegrain focus of VLT-ANTU on September 15, 1998. FORS2 came next in 2000 on VLT-Kueyen. Both instruments have also been used on Melipal and Yepun, and they are currently installed again on Antu (FORS2) and Kueyen (FORS1). They are among the most productive instruments at the VLT, contributing to over 750 peer-reviewed papers with nearly 20,000 citations, indicating a high scientific impact. Shortly after starting regular operations, FORS2 was upgraded when its original 2k Ã— 2k Tektronix detector was replaced with a mosaic of two red-optimized MIT/LL CCDs. Additionally, several prototype volume-phased holographic grisms were added, significantly increasing its scientific output. We aimed to replicate this success with FORS1, starting with the introduction of the 1200 B VPHG, which enhanced capabilities for stellar and extragalactic observations by doubling spectral resolution while maintaining high grism throughput.
