Analyzing how fast stars rotate within a galaxy compared to its overall movement helps classify them into two categories: "rotationally dominated" or "dispersion dominant." This classification plays a crucial role in understanding if they exhibit a disc shape characteristic of certain types of galaxy formation (called "discier"). The study found evidence suggesting higher levels of rotation correlate with disc shapes at higher redshifts (z 1), supporting observations from lower redshifts where spiral shaped disks were also found associated with greater rotation speed within certain masses . While these high-redshift discs might appear fragmented due lower rotational speeds relative their lower redshift counterparts , this early observation suggests there's connection between galactic structure and star formation at different stages across cosmic time scales .
