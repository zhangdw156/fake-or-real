Visible and Near Infrared (NIR) coverage has become an essential element in the observation of faint sources, as the large wavelength baseline enables many important spectral features in the spectral energy distribution to be measured, and therefore the **Roquefort** instrument offers a large instantaneous wavelength range. The instrument layout is organized around four channels, each with its own optical train, slit-masks, filters, gratings, flexure compensation, detector array and dewar, and associated hardware. Two channels are optimized for the visible from 0.37 to 1 µm, the two other channels are optimized for the NIR from 0.6 to 1.6 µm, cutting off before the thermal background becomes dominant. The optics provide excellent image quality and a high total instrument throughput of about 72% excluding detector arrays. Together with a fine pixel sampling of 0.05 arcsecond/pixel, this will enable the **Roquefort** to make use of the best images delivered by the telescope, particularly if the **Cheddar** system in the telescope delivers improved images over the wide field of the instrument. Flexure is actively compensated along each of the channels using a tip-tilt actuation based on the second folding mirror in each channel. The camera of each channel focuses on a 4k × 12k pixel array of 15 µm pixels, with CCDs for the visible channels and HgCdTe arrays for the NIR. Slits are cut in metal sheets with a laser machine, with exceptional slit roughness accuracy. Masks, filters and gratings are installed/removed on the optical path using robust industrial robots. In addition, high spatial and spectral resolution integral field spectroscopy in a field of ~ 10 arcsecond² could be easily added as the instrument is conceived in such a way that it can host a slicer-based integral field unit. **Roquefort** makes use of mature and proven technology, minimizing the development risk, and could therefore start being built now, and certainly could be ready by the E-ELT first light. It can perform extremely deep imaging to magnitude AB ~ 28.75 (4 h, 3σ, in 1.2-arc-second aperture) over the full FOV with a high density of sources, as well as multi-slit spectroscopy of about 480 objects at once down to AB ~ 26.5 (4 h, 3σ, R ~ 300, point source), or 160 objects at R ~ 3000. This will allow the detection of very high redshift "first light" objects. This performance can be reached without the use of **Cheddar**, and is comparable to that of JWST NIRCAM and NIRSPEC at 1 µm, and the best currently planned for ELTs. Using the **Cheddar**-corrected images delivered by the telescope, **Roquefort** allows an even deeper exploration of the Universe.
