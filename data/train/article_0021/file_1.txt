DIORAMAS is designed to observe faint astronomical objects with its wide range of wavelengths. The instrument uses four optical channels, each with separate components for collecting light and then processing it. These channels cover visible light (0.37 to 1 µm) and near-infrared light (0.6 to 1.6 µm).  The instrument's high sensitivity results from careful optical design, including precise slit positioning and excellent image quality, achieving a total throughput of about 72%. DIORAMAS is equipped to take advantage of the telescope's advanced imaging system for even greater data collection potential. Flexure compensation is used throughout the instrument to minimize distortions in the images.  Each channel incorporates a large-format camera with a high pixel count (4k × 12k pixels), and it uses different detectors depending on the wavelength: CCDs for visible channels and HgCdTe arrays for the NIR. SLIT masks, filters, and gratings are moved via robust robots for efficient installation/removal.  DIORAMAS is built with a future-proof design to incorporate advanced spectroscopy tools, potentially allowing users to collect spectral data of multiple sources simultaneously over large areas in both spatial and spectral resolution, enabling the study of faint objects at various cosmic distances. It can achieve deep imaging for faint stars and galaxies (magnitude AB ~ 28.75), as well as perform multi-slit spectroscopy on a large number of objects (AB ~ 26.5). These capabilities will allow scientists to study early galaxies and distant celestial events.  DIORAMAS utilizes established technology and is readily deployable, making it a robust instrument for scientific observations with the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT). The use of the telescope's GLAO system enhances its potential even further.
