The Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey uses the VLT FLAMES instrument to analyze the spectra of over 100,000 stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way. This survey aims to determine the distribution of chemical elements in different stellar populations within our galaxy's bulge, thick disk, thin disk, and halo. It will also study a large sample of open star clusters representing various ages and masses. This research is expected to advance understanding of galactic and stellar evolution.  Combined with precise measurements of stars' positions and movement, the survey will provide detailed information about the history and evolution of our galaxy's populations, including young, mature, and ancient stars. The precision astrometry for this survey relies on the Gaia "Galactic census" data expected to be released in 2016. This survey is considered a major undertaking in ground-based astronomy, involving hundreds of scientists from multiple institutions.
