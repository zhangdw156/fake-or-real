To study the detached shells around stars R Scl and V644 Sco, astronomers used a specialized instrument called PolCor on the ESO 3.6-metre telescope. This instrument combines polarisation filtering and a coronagraph to detect faint light emitted by dust within the shells, particularly when illuminated by bright stars. The use of many short exposures allows for high-quality images thanks to the lucky imaging technique.  After processing, the seeing (light distortion) in R Scl was reduced from 1.3 arcseconds to 0.9 arcseconds. PolCor images had a pixel scale of 0.114 arcseconds/pixel. The observations were taken in V-band and R-band for both shells.  Dust grains scatter light from the star, which reveals information about the distribution of dust within the shells. This scattering can be used to study the grain size, as it affects how much scattered light is present at a specific wavelength. The resulting image shows linear polarization with its peak when the direction of the incoming light and scattered light are close to 90 degrees. This type of observation primarily probes dust distribution in the plane of the sky. The PolCor observations were conducted for an initial testing phase as part of a pilot project to evaluate this instrument's potential for observing dusty circumstellar environments around stars that have undergone significant mass loss. A total of 14 evolved stars were observed, differing in characteristics like mass-loss rates and binary companions, while their morphology showed clear extended and geometrical features.  The detached shells are easily analyzed using the polarized light observations in visible wavelengths.
