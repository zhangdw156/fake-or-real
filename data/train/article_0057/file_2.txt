## A Stellar Symphony: Unraveling the Cosmic Dust Dance Through Polarisation

We embarked on a cosmic journey aboard the ESO 3.6-metre telescope, equipped with the PolCor instrument - a sonic marvel of astronomy crafted at Stockholm University. Think of it as a polarising wizard conjuring images of stellar starlight amidst the swirling dust clouds. This ingenious device combines a sophisticated polariser and a cunning coronagraph, allowing us to glimpse faint, elusive whispers in the cosmic symphony of light – scattered across the stellar canvas. 

"***We can never see what we're not meant to see," *** Bowie crooned in "Space Oddity."  Our PolCor instrument is like that - a key to uncovering hidden worlds obscured by bright stars and dense dust clouds. We used a staggering number of short exposures, employing the “lucky imaging” technique to capture high-quality images with astonishing detail. This ingenious process reduced our observation's stellar noise (seeing) from a turbulent 1.3 arcseconds to a harmonious 0.9 arcseconds in the final shifted and added image. The PolCor’s resolution,  with each pixel revealing information at a scale of 0.114 arcseconds, is practically a cosmic telescope with an artistic eye! We captured images in the V-band (0.55 µm) and R-band (0.64 µm), capturing the ethereal beauty of the circumstellar envelope (CSE). As Bowie reminds us, “***The earth keeps spinning on its axis.***”  And our observations capture this cosmic dance of light, as it is scattered by dust grains in the CSE. 


"***Space was the place, and he lived there for ages, a lifetime long... he would not die. ***"   David Bowie once again echoes the vastness of space, echoing our observation's quest to understand this cosmic dance,  the scattering of light from stars is intricately linked to dust grain distribution in the CSE. This scattered starlight illuminates the sky as a beacon of information. It’s as if they whispered tales of ancient star formation: “***Dust will always be part of the universe.***” The total amount of scattered light depends on the grains' size, their scattering efficiency and the abundance of these tiny particles. 

" ***Everything that has been in your life... is a reflection of where you were.* ** ” Bowie’s words resonate deeply as we delve into the secrets of dust-scattered starlight. In essence, observations of polarized light are like "***peeking into the souls of stars.***"  The star's unpolarized light reflects off the dust grains, creating linear polarization in the scattered light. And just as we see Bowie’s reflection through the dust on the cosmos, so too do these images reveal where the dust resides, offering insights into the distribution of dust grains independent of radiative transfer effects for low optical depths (for thermal dust emission).


Our journey was part of a larger exploration - a pilot project to test PolCor's capabilities. As Bowie tells us in "Space Oddity," "***You’re just another face on the planet.**" We observed 14 evolved stars, each with its unique properties and stories – varying stellar mass loss rates and binary companions – all enveloped by intriguing circumstellar structures, revealing a breathtaking tapestry of dust clouds around them. The detached shells that adorned these star systems provided ideal subjects for polarised light observations. "***And if you're lucky, then I'm there to hear what you have to say.***" As Bowie suggests, the detached shells’ extended nature and geometry were the perfect stage for this cosmic ballet of light and dust.
