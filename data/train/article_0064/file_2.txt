Different formation scenarios lead to varying patterns of age, metallicity, and a/Fe enhancement across different regions of galaxies. Thus, understanding the radial gradients of these properties in bulge stellar populations is essential for grasping how they formed and evolved. In the monolithic collapse model, gas moves to the center of the galaxy, leading to star formation and galactic winds, which create a steep metallicity gradient and a strong a/Fe enhancement gradient. However, for bulges that form over longer periods, like through dissipationless secular evolution, predictions are less clear. In this case, the bulge forms from the redistribution of stars from the disc. The gradients present in the original disc could either be increased, since the bulge has a smaller scale length, or reduced due to disc heating. Measuring age, metallicity, and a/Fe gradients in bulges may be complicated by light from the underlying disc population, which is less of an issue at the galaxy center but more significant in the outer bulge areas where the disc light dominates. To minimize the effects of this contamination and to maximize the area for gradient measurement, we focused on the radius (rbd) where the contributions of the bulge and disc to the total surface brightness are equal. For each galaxy, we calculated the Mg2, Hb, and <Fe> indices at rbd. The gradients were determined by the difference in values between the center and rbd, with errors estimated via Monte Carlo simulations. These indices were then converted into distribution gradients. The distribution width (s) was approximated by the value encompassing 68 percent of the objects and is also reported. 

Most galaxies in the sample show no age gradient, with an average at 0.4 Gyr. Negative metallicity gradients were observed, with a peak in the distribution at [Z/H] = âˆ’0.15 dex. The negative metallicity gradient supports a formation scenario involving dissipative collapse. Such a collapse typically leads to strong inside-out formation, which should also produce a negative gradient in a/Fe enhancement; however, nearly all galaxies did not show an a/Fe gradient in their radial profiles. Deviations from median values can be explained by errors alone. No relationship exists between the central value and the a/Fe gradient, yet a correlation is seen between the central value and metallicity gradient. These observations imply that a pure dissipative collapse is insufficient to explain bulge formation, suggesting that additional factors like mergers or acquisition events may need to be considered.
