Different formation scenarios lead to varying patterns of age, metallicity, and a/Fe enhancement across different regions of galaxies. Thus, understanding the radial gradients of these properties in bulge stellar populations is essential for studying their formation and evolution. In the monolithic collapse scenario, gas collects at the galaxy center, leading to concentrated star formation and galactic winds, which create a steep metallicity gradient. A strong gradient in a/Fe enhancement is also anticipated. However, predictions for bulges that form over long periods, like through dissipationless secular evolution, are mixed. In these cases, the bulge forms from the redistribution of stars from the disc. The gradients present in the progenitor disc might be increased, since the resulting bulge has a shorter scalelength, or diminished due to disc heating. An obstacle to measuring gradients in age, metallicity, and [a/Fe] in bulges could be the interference from the underlying disc's stellar light. While this effect is minor at the galaxy's center, it may become more significant near the bulge's outer regions, where light is increasingly dominated by the disc stars. To minimize this contamination and extend the area for gradient measurements, we conducted our analysis within rbd, where contributions to the overall surface brightness are equal from the bulge and disc. For each galaxy, we measured the Mg2, Hb, and <Fe> line strength indices at rbd. We calculated the gradients as the difference in values between the center and rbd, establishing errors using Monte Carlo simulations. The indices were then transformed into gradients. The distributions’ width, s, reflects the range containing 68 percent of the data points and is also reported. 

Most galaxies studied show no age gradient, with a median of 0.4 Gyr. Negative metallicity gradients were recorded, notably peaking at [Z/H] = −0.15 dex. This negative gradient implies bulge formation through dissipative collapse, which should also result in a negative gradient for a/Fe enhancement. However, virtually no a/Fe gradient was identified in these galaxies’ radial profiles. Variations from the median in the other measurements can be explained by their errors alone. There is no relationship between the central a/Fe value and its gradient, though the central metallicity value correlates with its gradient. All these observations suggest that a purely dissipative collapse isn't sufficient to explain bulge formation, and that other processes like mergers or accretion events may need to be considered.
