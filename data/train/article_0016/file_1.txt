The goal during "Science Verification" was testing how well a new instrument works using real observations before it starts operating normally at full capacity with astronomers using it for research purposes . MUSE is one such instrument used on VLT telescopes that can operate in various ways; one method called "wide field" became available starting in period 94 allowing astronomers natural viewing capabilities without needing special equipment but this wasn't always reliable until they added ground layer adaptive optics via GALACSI which uses lasers and other specialized tools with this setup; this allowed them test out this method through "MUSE Wide Field Adaptive Optics Science Verification'. This process took place between August September in order to ensure everything worked properly before launching into full operation which involved scheduling many proposals over multiple nights due to weather problems with some programs being cut short but also allowing extra time when needed later on . In total there was a good amount done but some projects couldn't get started or got partially completed so we will summarize what happened here based on all that happened while preparing for full operation!
