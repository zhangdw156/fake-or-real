The observations of the Pluto-Charon system and Triton were made with the NACO adaptive optics instrument at the ESO VLT from August 3 to August 7, 2005. The goal for Pluto-Charon was to identify the individual components of the binary system and measure their spectra separately for the first time. Previously, such measurements had only been possible through inferred data from overlapping or indirect measurements of the system. Additionally, we aimed to broaden the wavelength range of the surface spectroscopy beyond the K-band to capture Pluto's spectra up to 5 µm and Charon's at least up to 4 µm, with hopes of detecting more surface ice absorption bands suggested by current models and discovering signs of undiscovered ices. Triton, which could also be observed from the VLT, provided a useful comparison since its JHK spectrum is similar to Pluto's but differs from Charon's, and it is well understood. Like Pluto, the 3–5 µm range for Triton has not yet been explored, even though Triton is classified as a captured Kuiper Belt object by Neptune.
