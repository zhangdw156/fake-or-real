The observations of the Pluto-Charon binary and Triton were made with the NACO adaptive optics instrument at the ESO VLT from August 3 to 7, 2005. The goal for Pluto-Charon was to resolve the binary system and to individually measure their spectra for the first time, as previous spectra could only be obtained by analyzing unresolved and occultation data. Additionally, we aimed to expand the wavelength range of the surface spectroscopy beyond the K-band, targeting Pluto's spectra up to 5 µm and Charon's at least up to 4 µm. This was to help detect more surface ice absorption features predicted by models based on existing JHK spectra and to explore possible unknown ices. Triton, which could also be observed from the VLT at this time, served as a useful comparison since its JHK spectrum is similar to Pluto's but differs from Charon's, and it is well understood. Like Pluto, the 3–5 µm range for Triton has not yet been explored, even though Triton is considered a Kuiper Belt object captured by Neptune.
