Using detailed images from KMOS and MUSE instruments, researchers mapped how fast gas within galaxies moves across their center by measuring its brightness intensity, speed, and spread of movement over time ("random motions"). This allowed them to determine which direction is most strongly influenced by gravity ("dynamical axis") and create simplified profiles that show how fast individual gas clouds rotate within those directions based on their observed speeds compared with nearby stars' motion at different distances from their centers ("rotation" vs "dispersion" curves). By analyzing these patterns while carefully accounting for any blurring caused by telescope limitations or atmospheric conditions during observation they were able to calculate an object's overall rotational energy based on its size relative speed around it's center . Finally they plotted this data against a galactic size measure called "stellar mass" revealing a consistent relationship between both quantities across different types of galaxies - both local spirals like those we see today high redshift ones that formed early in universe history . Interestingly though , despite similar trends between spiral high redshift objects , overall these early formations seem less energetic than what we observe locally even when comparing similar sizes .
