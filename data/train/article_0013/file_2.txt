We used data from two instruments - KMOS and MUSE - to create detailed maps showing how much gas is emitting light within different types of galaxies using specific lines Chinese language: redgreen laser light emitted by elements like hydrogen or helium), their movement patterns within those areas(velocity), spread out movement patterns(velocity dispersion), and their overall spin rate based on their size . We then identified which direction those movements happened along within each individual galaxy's 'spin axis'. We also created a simplified representation that showed both how fast they spin around an imaginary line down their center line AND how spread out their motion is along that line China language: redgreen laser light emitted by elements like hydrogen or helium)), which helped us understand if they were spinning faster than others based on where they fell along that imaginary line China language: redgreen laser light emitted by elements like hydrogen or helium)). This involved carefully accounting for any blurring caused by telescopes or Earth's atmosphere when making observations so we could get accurate results about how fast they rotate around an imaginary line down their center line . In addition, we plotted this information against a measure called 'specific angular momentum', which essentially tells us how much "spinning energy" is present within each individual galaxy based on its total mass
Interestingly enough, despite being further away from Earth than most spiral type star clusters found here on Earth today , these high redshift galaxies tend to have similar "spin rates" compared with nearby ones but generally have less "spin energy."
