VLT Image of Globular Cluster 47 Tuc

47 Tucanae is a remarkable globular cluster visible to the naked eye from the southern hemisphere, appearing as large as the full moon. The color image of 47 Tucanae shown here was captured with FORS1 on ESOâ€™s Very Large Telescope in 2001. This image focuses on the densest center of the cluster. The red giants, stars that have depleted the hydrogen in their cores and expanded in size, stand out clearly. In 47 Tuc, stars are spaced less than a tenth of a light year apart, which is comparable to the size of the Solar System. In contrast, the nearest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri, is four light years away. This high density can lead to interactions, resulting in dynamic processes that create many exotic objects within the cluster. Consequently, 47 Tuc contains at least twenty millisecond pulsars (neutron stars). The Hubble Space Telescope recently observed 47 Tuc to investigate planets that orbit very close to their stars. These observations indicated that such "hot Jupiters" are likely much rarer in 47 Tucanae compared to stars near our Sun. This might suggest either that the dense cluster environment is unfavorable for close-in planets, or that the planet formation process has evolved since the early history of our Galaxy.
