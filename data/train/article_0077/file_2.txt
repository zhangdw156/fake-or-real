The Fourth Advanced Chilean School of Astrophysics: Interferometry in the ALMA and VLTI Era

The interferometry school focused on ALMA and VLTI took place at the Universidad Católica de Chile in Santiago from December 4 to 8, 2006. This program was organized by the FONDAP Center for Astrophysics together with Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Universidad de Concepción, ESO, ALMA, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and the U.S. Office of Naval Research Global. Its purpose was to teach young researchers and students from Chile and other parts of Latin America the basics of interferometry in both radio and optical domains and to present current and upcoming tools, methods, and insights. Experts also discussed how interferometry affects the study of star-forming regions, galaxies, and the distant universe. Participants learned about the opportunities coming soon with ALMA and VLTI. Invited speakers included Tom Armstrong, Dave Mozurkevich, Juan Uson, Paul Van den Bout, Al Wootten, Robert Laing, Massimo Tarenghi, Tony Beasley, Ricardo Bustos, Paulo Cortes, Christian Hummel, Kotaro Kohno, and Markus Schöller. Various topics were also presented during the poster session. Recordings of the lectures can be accessed on the school’s website. The event was supported financially by the FONDAP Center for Astrophysics and included close to 150 participants from Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, Mexico, and Chile, with funds covering full or part of the tuition for all students. Participants enjoyed a lively discussion about “The Genesis of ALMA” by Paul Van den Bout during the school dinner at the Hacienda Santa Martina and explored the facilities at the Universidad Católica Observatory.
