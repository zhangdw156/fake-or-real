The Fourth Advanced Chilean School of Astrophysics focused on interferometry during the ALMA and VLTI era and took place at the Universidad Católica de Chile in Santiago from December 4 to 8, 2006. This school, organized by the FONDAP Center for Astrophysics in collaboration with several institutions, aimed to teach young Chilean and Latin American researchers and students the basics of radio and optical interferometry, as well as the latest instrumentation, techniques, and results. Experts also explored how interferometry affects the study of star-forming regions, galaxies, and the early Universe. Students learned about upcoming opportunities with ALMA and VLTI. Notable speakers included Tom Armstrong, Dave Mozurkevich, Juan Uson, Paul Van den Bout, Al Wootten, Robert Laing, Massimo Tarenghi, Tony Beasley, Ricardo Bustos, Paulo Cortes, Christian Hummel, Kotaro Kohno, and Markus Schöller. A variety of topics were also covered during a poster session, and the lectures are available on the school's website. The FONDAP Center for Astrophysics funded the school, which attracted nearly 150 participants from Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, Mexico, and Chile, providing full or partial financial support to students. Attendees enjoyed a presentation on “The Genesis of ALMA” by Paul Van den Bout during a dinner at Hacienda Santa Martina and visited the Universidad Católica Observatory.
