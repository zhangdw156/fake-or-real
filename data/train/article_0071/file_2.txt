Two new science projects scheduled for Period 84 include studying the binary properties of massive young stars in the Carina Nebula and analyzing the light curves of eclipsing binaries in starburst cluster centers. We are open to collaborating with other research teams who wish to utilize the high angular resolution and fast time resolution provided by Lucky Imaging at the NTT, which is the only easily accessible site in the Southern Hemisphere to use this technique under nearly ideal conditions. The availability of burst mode on several VLT instruments allows for individual readouts to be stored for post-processing, rather than only co-adding frames. As a result, techniques similar to Lucky Imaging, such as selecting and re-registering individual frames before co-adding, are becoming increasingly common, enhancing angular resolution and sensitivity. NACO observations in the J- and H-bands benefit the most since the shorter wavelengths experience decreased atmospheric coherence time, making it more challenging for the adaptive optics system to adjust to atmospheric changes. Experiments with a Lucky Imaging camera and adaptive optics at the Palomar 5-meter telescope show great promise. A Lucky Imaging camera like AstraLux Sur attached to the visitor port of the VLT NAOS instrument could achieve an angular resolution of 20 mas at a wavelength of 900 nm.
