In the coming years, we anticipate that improvements in the imaging capabilities of the VLTI will focus mainly on better data quality and an increase in the number of available interferometric baselines. The Science Operations team at the Paranal Observatory is currently working on these aspects. For example, they plan to expand the number of available AT triplets from four to over ten. However, creating and offering new triplets and telescope stations requires significant effort from both Engineering and Science Operations teams. VLTI is expected to receive the second-generation instruments MATISSE and GRAVITY, which will use four telescopes. Using four telescopes at once, instead of three, doubles the number of simultaneous visibility measurements; this means with just one additional telescope, the interferometer can collect enough data to create an image twice as fast. We believe it should be possible to reconstruct a simple image in about two observing nights instead of the current four. Acquiring six ATs could be a crucial advancement for enabling routine imaging within the ESO Service Mode. For the UTs, the main challenge is to minimize their mechanical vibrations so they are suitable for interferometry; achieving this could lead to significant improvements in interferometric efficiency. The VLTI would then be able to create simple images of 11th magnitude objects when using all four UTs together. The VSI instrument is intended to allow the combination of six and eventually eight telescopes at once. With real-time data processing, which is feasible within the standard ESO observation framework, it would provide a practical snapshot imaging capability. Ideally, a visiting astronomer at the VLTI would see the image of the observed object being reconstructed in real-time at the console.
