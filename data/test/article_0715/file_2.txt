In the coming years, we anticipate that upgrades to the VLTI's imaging capabilities will focus mainly on improving data quality and increasing the number of available interferometric baselines. The Science Operations team at the Paranal Observatory is actively working on these aspects, including plans to raise the number of available AT triplets from four to over ten. However, offering new triplets and telescope stations will require significant efforts from both the Engineering and Science Operations teams. The VLTI is set to receive new second-generation instruments, MATISSE and GRAVITY, which will utilize four telescopes. Using four telescopes instead of three will double the available visibility measurements and allow the interferometer to gather enough data to create an image twice as fast. We believe that a simple image could be produced in about two nights of observation instead of the current four. Acquiring six ATs could also crucially enable routine imaging within the ESO Service Mode. For the UTs, the key challenge is to minimize mechanical vibrations to acceptable levels for interferometry; if this can be done, there will be significant improvements in interferometric efficiency. The VLTI should then be able to create simple images of objects with an 11th magnitude when using all four UTs. The VSI instrument is planned to merge six, or even eight, telescopes at the same time. With real-time data processing, which is feasible within the ESO observation framework, it would allow for creating near-instant images. Ideally, an astronomer visiting the VLTI would see images of their observed object being built in real-time at the console.
