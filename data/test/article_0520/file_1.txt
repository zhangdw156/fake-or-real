The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) successfully tested its ability to observe objects up to 15 kilometers apart using submillimeter-wave imaging. This campaign demonstrated that ALMA can produce detailed images with resolutions of tens of milliarcseconds. Five targets were observed, including an asteroid, a protoplanetary disc, an evolved star and a galaxy lensed by gravity. These results show that the scientific goals of ALMA have been achieved. 

ALMA is a global project with partners in different continents, dedicated to building and operating the worldâ€™s largest array for observing millimeter/submillimeter wavelengths.  Located at an altitude of 5000 meters above sea level in Chile, it currently consists of 66 antennas. The "Early Science Cycle 3" proposal submission was recently completed, resulting in a large number of proposals received. A key new capability introduced within this cycle allows observation with high angular resolution using baselines up to 10 kilometers. This feature underwent testing and verification during the dedicated campaign held in late 2014.  

 ALMA is continually expanding its capabilities, including the addition of new instruments, digital systems, software for data handling and analysis, and new observing modes (like Very Long Baseline Interferometry). These efforts are aimed at keeping ALMA at the forefront of astronomical research for many years to come.
