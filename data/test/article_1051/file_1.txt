The APEX telescope is a modified version of the VERTEX ALMA prototype, designed for independent operation as a single dish. It includes two extra Nasmyth cabins for heterodyne receivers and two large containers for additional equipment like spectrometers, synthesizers, compressors, and chillers, bringing the total weight of the modified telescope to around 125 tons. It features a Cassegrain system with a parabolic main reflector on an alt-azimuth mount. The 12-meter-wide reflector is made up of 264 aluminum panels arranged in eight rings and is supported by a carbon fiber reinforced plastic backup structure consisting of 24 sandwich shell segments. This structure is held by an INVAR cone that is connected to the top of the Cassegrain cabin. The adjustable panels are designed with a surface accuracy of 8 micrometers RMS and have been chemically etched to diffuse solar radiation, allowing the telescope to operate during the day. The aluminum secondary reflector, held up by CFRP quadripod legs, provides a suitable field of view for wide-field bolometer arrays within the Cassegrain cabin. For operations in the Nasmyth cabins, the telescope waist is modified by refocusing optics to create the Nasmyth waists. The tertiary mirror package can rotate to switch between the two Nasmyth foci and to clear the optical path for the bolometer pick-up mirror.
