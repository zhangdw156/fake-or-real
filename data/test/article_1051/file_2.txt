The APEX telescope is an upgraded version of the VERTEX ALMA prototype, designed for independent operation as a single dish. It includes two extra Nasmyth cabins for heterodyne receivers and two large containers for additional equipment such as spectrometers, synthesizers, compressors, and chillers, bringing the total weight of the modified antenna to about 125 tons. This telescope uses a Cassegrain system with a parabolic main reflector mounted on an alt-azimuth framework. The reflector, 12 meters in diameter and made up of 264 aluminum panels arranged in eight rings, is attached to a carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) support structure consisting of 24 sandwich shell segments. The support structure is held up by an INVAR cone fixed to the top of the Cassegrain cabin. The panels are individually adjustable and crafted to a surface precision of 8 Âµm rms; they are chemically treated to scatter sunlight, enabling observations during the day. The aluminum secondary reflector, which is held in place by CFRP legs, creates a suitable field-of-view for wide-field bolometer arrays in the Cassegrain cabin. For usage in the Nasmyth compartments, refocusing optics adjust the telescope waist from the secondary to fit the Nasmyth waists. The tertiary mirror assembly rotates to switch between the two Nasmyth points and to clear the optical path for the bolometer pick-up mirror.
