Despite progress, the polishing of M1 mirror caused delays in meeting the originally planned timeline for the VISTA project.  This 4.1-meter mirror is highly aspheric with significant deviations from a perfect sphere, requiring specialized polishing tools and extended time compared to expectations. The fast-paced design posed difficulties due to these specific characteristics, which were underestimated by the manufacturer. These delays caused frustration as it impacted the project's timeline since funding was secured in 2001 and M1 shaping concluded in 2003. While the polishing finally achieved high quality, the time spent on M1 prevented VISTA from being delivered on schedule. To overcome this delay, M1 was transported by air instead of sea and arrived at VISTA during Easter 2008. The coating plant applied a superior silver coating to VISTA, resulting in enhanced sensitivity compared to conventional aluminum coating.
