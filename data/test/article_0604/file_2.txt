The most successful outcomes from the system test campaign are the meeting of critical performance specifications. These include: residual wavefront error after adaptive optics correction, response time, chopping stroke and its response time. The primary way to verify DSM performance is through a follow-up error test. Numerical phase screens simulating real conditions (1.5 arcseconds at 0.5 μm wavelength, 20 degrees elevation angle, and 1000-mode correction) were created at ESO. These are difficult simulations to accurately represent real-world effects. By studying these simulations, we can deduce how the DSM should reshape itself to correct wavefront distortions. A file containing actuator time history has been provided to Microgate. The next step is to activate the DSM and have it "think" that capacitive sensors measure the distances based on the time history data. This internal control loop then adjusts for these discrepancies. Finally, the system measures the corresponding capacitive sensor signal values over time and makes a few basic assumptions about timing delay at each calculation cycle. These calculations provide a delta which can be measured between the real mirror position and the perturbation sent to the DSM (this is our error signal). If we add the higher-order modes correction's effect, not corrected by the DSM, to this error value, it provides the system's actual performance as represented by residual root mean square (rms) wavefront error. The test result is 131.5 nm rms wavefront error, against a target of 149 nm rms.  The internal control loop within the DSM (coils and capacitive sensors) played a vital role in this test, allowing for full subsystem qualification prior to integration with the AOF, which also utilizes guide stars, an external real-time computer, and optical Shack–Hartmann sensors.
