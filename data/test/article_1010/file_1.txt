One drawback of previous studies on the correlation between mid-infrared (MIR) and hard X-ray emissions was the poor angular resolution of the MIR observations. Seyfert galaxies often have areas of active star formation near the active galactic nucleus (AGN) that also emit in the MIR range. If we cannot distinctly identify these star-forming areas, it becomes challenging to separate them using methods like spectral decomposition. We chose to conduct our study using the VISIR instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), which currently offers the best combination of spatial resolution and sensitivity in the mid-infrared. In addition to the angular resolution of the MIR observations, another concern was the reliability of our X-ray data. As noted earlier, we need the true X-ray luminosity to estimate the total luminosity of the accretion disc. Unfortunately, X-rays are also absorbed by the torus. However, high-quality X-ray spectra enable us to account for this absorption, as it alters the X-ray spectrum of an AGN in a specific way. Thus, we decided to observe a sample of Type 1 and Type 2 Seyfert galaxies with VISIR for which high-quality X-ray data were available. To take full advantage of VISIRâ€™s high angular resolution, we limited our observations to relatively nearby AGNs, setting a redshift limit of 0.1 for our sample selection.
