Imagine hurling yourself around like a cosmic yo-yo!  But instead of normal gravity, it's near-weightless fun – think zero-gravity acrobatics. Now picture a massive rock flying at the speed of light. It's a dizzying image, right?

Our study focuses on these crazy disc galaxies. We've been playing "Zero Gravity Tag" with them –  spinning and bouncing around like cosmic pinball machines! We discovered that these discs are packed with gas, almost half the mass of what they could be in normal gravity! And guess what? They're so chaotic even the slightest turn can cause massive clouds to form - a real-life space rock toss competition. 

But here's the kicker – their spinning action is like juggling three plates at once, generating powerful gas eruptions and pulling huge chunks of matter into each other.  It's all happening faster than ever before in any normal gravity galaxy! Think of it as an insane game of Cosmic Jenga! The galaxies are like cosmic clowns, throwing themselves around in a frenzy that would make even the most seasoned astronaut dizzy!

The gas-rich discs create these massive clumps – think giant boulders you could throw across the solar system with one push. These clumps move through the galaxy in a constant dance, crashing into each other and forming new structures like cosmic Lego blocks. And just as in zero gravity,  they are building up this central bulge of stars - it's not just a boring sphere anymore! 

What’s even crazier is that these "giant rock flingers" seem to follow certain rules - like the laws of physics – which helps us understand how galaxies evolve. They might not be as obvious in our own solar system, but in this crazy space-time playground, we're seeing a whole new dimension of action and formation!
