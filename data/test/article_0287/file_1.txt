The SPECULOOS project began in 2011 by observing just fifty Southern ultracool dwarf stars (UCDs) using data from TRAPPIST South's telescope array to test its potential for finding exoplanets around UCDs). This initial survey unexpectedly discovered an amazing planetary system called TRAPPIST - 1 containing seven Earth sized planet orbiting within their star's habitable zone at varying periods between one point five days to nineteen days . With high precision measurements thanks to their resonant configurations , scientists determined these worlds are likely made up primarilyof rocks and have significant amounts of volatiles compared to earth'. This discovery suggests there may be many similar systems like this one found around other UCDs which would make future observations even more fruitful as they can use telescopes like JWST or future ones designed specifically for studying atmospheres on exoplanets . The success so far has led researchers into believing there might be numerous such 'TRAPPIST -like' systems out there waiting for discovery by SPECULOOS .
