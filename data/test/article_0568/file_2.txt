VIMOS, with its four identical arms each boasting a staggering 7×8 arcminute field of view spanning the sky, presents formidable capabilities in astronomy. Its instrument offers three primary modes: U-, V-, B-, R-, I- and z-band imaging covering four fields each seven by eight arcminutes across.  This is complemented by slit-based multi-object spectroscopy capable of resolution up to 2500, allowing for profound observation and analysis. Integral-field unit (IFU) spectroscopy further enhances this capability, providing field views ranging from 13×13 to 54×54 arcseconds.

Despite eight years of dedicated service, VIMOS's lifespan wasn't meant to be limited. The instrument underwent a crucial upgrade to ensure continued accuracy and effectiveness in the face of unprecedented challenges. First and foremost, this involved replacing aging shutters, bolstering its reliability, along with upgrading faulty CCD detectors, minimizing instrument flexure and optimizing the data reduction pipeline for seamless operation. After rigorous testing in November 2009 and February 2010, VIMOS underwent a meticulous overhaul from May to July 2010. Following re-commissioning at the end of July, the instrument required a dedicated period for fine adjustments and optimization before rejoining its role on the telescope.
