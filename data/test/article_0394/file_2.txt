The AMAZE and LSD samples show a wide range in galaxy size (mass) and how quickly they form stars. This allows scientists to look at how metallicity (element richness) changes with star formation rate and mass at a specific time (redshift approximately 3.3). The average galaxy position of these two surveys reveals that galaxies at this redshift deviate from the typical metallicity relationship for stars, but it's clear they still follow a similar rule for how metallicity relates to star formation rate, even if not perfectly matched.  However, the more massive galaxies (at a specific stellar mass) are surprisingly less rich in metals compared to galaxies of smaller size at the same redshift. This suggests that these large galaxies have not quite reached the expected relationship between metallicity and star formation rate seen at lower redshifts, which challenges theories of how galaxies evolve with time. Possible explanations for this difference include a greater inflow of pristine, cold gas to fuel massive galaxy growth or the transfer of gas from outside of their centers into the cores that are forming stars. Scientists plan to study these galaxies in detail using SINFONI data to test these potential explanations.
