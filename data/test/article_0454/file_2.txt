Astronomers take observations from Earth's atmosphere which causes light pollution. Gasses like oxygen, water vapor, and others absorb and emit certain frequencies of light, creating a specific pattern in astronomical spectra known as "telluric absorption and emission lines." Removing these lines is difficult. One solution involves comparing an unknown star with standard stars to remove the telluric effect. Another approach is to use atmospheric modeling tools. This method creates accurate representations of the atmosphere's impact on observations, removing this interference without additional observation. 

The Earth's atmosphere has many components. Nitrogen (N2) shows no rotational-vibrational transitions, but other molecules like water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and ozone (O3) exhibit strong absorption lines that shape the near-infrared photometric bands.  Oxygen (O2) also absorbs light in the red portion of the optical spectrum, while nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4) influence infrared transmission and impact observations.   

The Earth's atmosphere absorbs light from astronomical sources at various wavelengths, from ultraviolet to radio waves, and emits light back out into space as well. Above about 2300 nm, atmospheric emission competes with the signal from astronomical objects, making it challenging to observe certain lines from stars and planets. The break-even point for this interference depends on the instrument's settings, but altitude of observation also plays a role. As the effect is spatial, beam-switching techniques, or fitting and subtracting signals along the slit can be used to remove atmospheric emission.
