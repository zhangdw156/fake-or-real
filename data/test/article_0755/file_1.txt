A New Service for the ESO Community: The Science Data Products Forum  
ESO provides support to its telescope users in many ways. At the La Silla Paranal Observatory, night astronomers perform service observations and help visiting astronomers with their observations. In Garching, the User Support Department assists throughout the observing process, from preparing Phase I and II proposals to publishing completed data products in the archive. ESO also offers calibration data and software for data reduction. In addition to the hands-on experience of ESO staff with the telescopes, there is a wealth of knowledge in the ESO community. Many experienced users are willing to share their insights, tools, and methods. However, general users often find it challenging to access the specific information they need. To facilitate and promote the sharing of relevant knowledge, ESO has launched a new online forum for discussing any issues related to ESO data.
