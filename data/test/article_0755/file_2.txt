A New Service for the ESO Community: The Science Data Products Forum  
ESO provides support to its telescope users in many ways. At the La Silla Paranal Observatory, night astronomers perform service observations and help visiting astronomers with their observations. Meanwhile, the User Support Department in Garching assists during the entire observing process, from preparing Phase I and II proposals to publishing completed data products through the archive. ESO also supplies calibration data and data-reduction software. In addition to the extensive knowledge gained by ESO staff from working with the telescopes, many seasoned users within the ESO community are ready to share their expertise, tools, and methods. However, general users often struggle to find the specific information they require. To facilitate and promote the exchange of relevant knowledge, ESO has created a new online forum for discussing any matters related to ESO data.
