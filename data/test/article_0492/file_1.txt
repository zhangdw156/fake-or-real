Astronomers have long suspected the presence of planets within the b Pic system due to intriguing observations. For instance, traces of dust, remnants of giant-body collisions and evaporation, suggest that building blocks for planetary formations already existed in the system. Further, we observed a predictable rate of cometary crashes—perfectly explained by gravitational forces exerted by a massive planet on these icy bodies. Simulations confirmed their likely presence near the star, nestled within 10 astronomical units (au).  

We also discovered intriguing light variations captured during observations from the Swiss Telescope in the 1980s. Analyzing this data revealed strange fluctuations that could be attributed to either a multi-cometary tail or a planet transiting our target star – both remarkable possibilities! 

Furthermore, thermal infrared readings showed inconsistencies within the b Pic system, resembling belt-like structures or clumps—a sign of powerful sculpting by planetary forces operating in the gaps.  These irregularities were linked specifically to the presence of a giant planet estimated at about 2–5 Jupiter's mass located roughly 10 au away from the star – a key discovery!

The discovery was bolstered by the Hubble Space Telescope and ESO’s Adaptive Optics, capturing detailed imagery of the b Pic system.  This high-resolution observation unveiled an inner warp in the scattered light – extending to several tens of astronomical units. This unique feature could be explained if a massive companion with a slightly angled orbit within the outer disc mid-plane was at play! The calculations based on this insight revealed that a planet’s mass and distance were crucial in shaping this warp, specifically a constraint of M×a2. 

While these observations are compelling evidence, we cannot definitively confirm the existence of planets until their presence is verified. But altogether, they provided us with a treasure trove of intriguing clues – a strong indication that planetary activity is indeed occurring within the b Pic system.
