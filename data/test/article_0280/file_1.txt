Based on our understanding of CS Cha's system components, there might be clues about how its smaller object emerged:
The dust disk surrounding its star doesn't extend far enough based on what they observe through polarized light; however this could change if there were deeper layers obscured by material within itself or by their own shadows cast upon it from other objects within proximity..
Further analysis suggests this object doesn't orbit perfectly circularly or directly along line up with where they observe dust particles from their star; instead they suggest some eccentricity due to its size relative to other known objects within their vicinity.. This also suggests an inclination between its orbit and both where they see dust particles from their star AND where this larger object spins..
They believe these findings point towards alternative origins for this smaller object than simply forming alongside its host star - suggesting perhaps it was part of another planetary system altogether! Future observation using ALMA could help confirm these theories regarding potential additional factors contributing towards such formation pathways...and characterization techniques like spectroscopy using near infrared wavelengths would provide more detailed information about this smaller body which current ground based telescopes are unable to capture fully yet .
