underground exploration efforts aim to understand how dramatic changes within dying sun like stars affect their surrounding world's composition over time; specifically they're looking at how far away objects like gas giants might react when confronted with these changes; they call out specific examples such as "plumes", "spirals", etc.; these studies provide insight into what might happen when our own sun reaches old age due to factors such as expanding size; ultimately scientists hope this study can help predict potential hazards for life forms within our solar system given similar occurrences elsewhere within other galaxies; however there exist significant technical challenges involved since many underground structures are obscured making them difficult for humans to observe directly so far
