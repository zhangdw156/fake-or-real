Scientists studied nearby red giant star L2 Puppis to understand how massive stars affect their orbiting planets during later stages like when they become giants like our sun one day may become.. They found evidence for dust clouds surrounding it with various structures including plumes and possibly even other objects within them . By studying these features using telescopes such as ALMA they were able to determine some properties about both itself and another object called "L" which may be either another planet or brown dwarf . Studying this provides scientists with insight into what our solar system might look like billions years from now when our sun reaches those stages . They believe it could lead us closer towards understanding how planetary systems evolve under these conditions . However they face difficulties due to limited observation tools , especially when observing objects further out , given how bright these giants can shine compared to smaller objects near them making them hard to study accurately .
