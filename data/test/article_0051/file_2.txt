Sending two sets on perfectly vertical waves into an Earth-based telescope called "ground-to-space" creates 4 distinct points or "ghost" images that all show similar distortions caused by how light bends when passing through it . The strength (how much light) you see from these "ghost" images depends on how strong each individual wave was when they were sent into it and where they landed on your camera's sensor; they'll always be there because they come out directly from both sides like two crossed beams or rays coming out from opposite ends . These "ghost" pictures also have some distortion because unlike real objects that have a defined size , these appear as if they were stretched out or squashed . To make sure we can see what we want we use this technique early in our data collection process because it helps us figure out where exactly our target object actually sits within all those distorted pictures . Also keep this one thing in mind: every single part has been carefully crafted for maximum efficiency - if you look closely enough you might notice some extra bright points across your picture due to how those parts were made!
