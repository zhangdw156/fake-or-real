When using a specific method called "waffle mode" on an instrument called HODM (which essentially acts like a coronagraph), two perpendicular waves are applied to it resulting in four distinct areas within an image called "satellite spots." These areas show identical distortions or aberrations from stars within them due to how they interact with light passing through these waves. The size and position within this pattern can be used for calculations about where stars might be positioned based on how they're distorted by these waves; for example this can help determine where stars might be located behind other objects blocking them out from view when taking pictures with SPHERE instruments that use this technique . Additionally there will always be some slight elongation around these areas due to limitations on what wavelengths can pass through because it has limitations on its spectral bandwidth .
