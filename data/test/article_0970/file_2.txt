1. Networking This section focuses on sharing information between ASTRONET and other relevant partners in European astronomical research. ASTRONET aims to establish regular coordination among program managers across European astronomy, with two key tasks: integrating new participants early in the project and creating ways to maintain the cross-disciplinary coordination established by ASTRONET on a permanent basis. 

2. A Science Vision for European astronomy This section aims to create a comprehensive inventory of European astronomical resources and national strategies, followed by a science-focused Strategic Review for the next 15–20 years. A Science Vision Working Group will conduct the Review with input from and approval by a broad European astronomical community by March 2007. 

3. A roadmap for the development of infrastructure for European astronomy Building on the recommendations from the “Science Vision,” this section will develop a strategic plan for the coordinated advancement of space- and ground-based astronomy in Europe, including identifying key enabling technologies, by December 2008. It will also pinpoint and begin specific actions to implement this roadmap. 

4. Targeted coordinated actions to strengthen astronomy and astrophysics in Europe This section will identify formal obstacles to enhancing Europe-wide cooperation and start coordinated actions to improve astronomy in Europe by developing common evaluation procedures and launching a specific multi-agency research program.
