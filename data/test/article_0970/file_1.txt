1. Networking This section focuses on sharing information between ASTRONET and key partners in European astronomy. ASTRONET's main objective is to establish regular coordination among program managers across Europe, and two key tasks are to involve new participants early in the project's duration and to create enduring methods for ongoing Europe-wide interdisciplinary coordination initiated by ASTRONET.

2. A Science Vision for European Astronomy This section aims to create a comprehensive overview of European astronomical assets and national strategies, followed by a science-based Strategic Review for the upcoming 15â€“20 years. A Science Vision Working Group will conduct the Review with contributions from, and approval by, a broad European astronomy community by March 2007.

3. A Roadmap for the Development of Infrastructure for European Astronomy Following the recommendations from the "Science Vision," this section will develop a strategic plan for coordinating the progress of space-based and ground-based astronomy in Europe, including identifying crucial enabling technologies, by December 2008. It will also pinpoint and begin specific actions needed to fulfill this roadmap.

4. Targeted Coordinated Actions to Strengthen Astronomy and Astrophysics in Europe This section will recognize formal obstacles to improved cooperation in Europe and will prompt coordinated efforts to enhance astronomy across Europe by creating common evaluation methods and launching a particular multi-agency research program.
