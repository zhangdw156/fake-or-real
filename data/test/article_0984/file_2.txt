The experiment's detection efficiency can be assessed from the data collected, which suggests a planet abundance time frame of about 10 years. A binary source star model was considered the best alternative but doesn't fit the data. Initial analyses focused on individual high-magnification events using a point-source model, later extended to 42 microlensing events recorded by PLANET between 1995 and 1999. Less than one-third of the lenses have Jupiter-like planets within 1 to 5 astronomical units. We are currently compiling analyses across 11 years of data. We evaluate the detection efficiency of each microlensing light curve concerning planetary companions based on the mass ratio and distance to the lens, incorporating extended source effects. A Bayesian method is applied to derive probability densities for lens stars and their planets. In 2004, the mean detection efficiency of PLANET was derived from 14 thoroughly observed events. It reaches 50 percent for Jupiter-mass planets, decreases based on the square root of planet mass, and faces limitations due to source star sizes for planets with a few Earth masses. However, it remains around a few percent for rocky and icy planets under 10 Earth masses. So far, four planets have been identified through microlensing: two similar to Jupiter, one like Neptune with superconducting perturbation due to a central caustic, and one 5.5 Earth-mass rocky or icy planet named OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb discovered via a planetary caustic. These findings are included in the analysis. Thus, microlensing has initiated the discovery of frozen Super-Earths, indicating that these small rocky or icy planets may be quite common.
