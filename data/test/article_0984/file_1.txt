The experiment's detection efficiency can be assessed using all the collected data, and comparing these detections provides insights into a planet abundance period of about 10 years. Although the best alternative model is a binary star system, it is not supported by the data. Initial efforts focused on individual high-magnification events using a point-source model, which were then expanded to a sample of the 42 well-studied microlensing events gathered by PLANET from 1995 to 1999. Less than one-third of the lenses are accompanied by Jupiter-like planets with orbits between 1 and 5 astronomical units. We are currently analyzing 11 years of data. We calculate the detection efficiency of each microlensing light curve in relation to lensing companions based on the mass ratio and projected separation of the components, now considering extended source effects. The same Bayesian analysis is used to determine probability densities for the properties of the lens star and planet. The average detection efficiency of PLANET includes 14 well-sampled events from 2004. For Jupiter-mass planets, the detection efficiency is 50 percent, while it decreases with the square root of the planet mass until smaller planets, a few Earth masses, are harder to detect due to the finite size of the source stars. Nevertheless, some efficiency remains at a few percent for planets under 10 Earth masses that are made of rock and ice. As of now, four planets have been detected through microlensing: two are similar to Jupiter, one like Neptune—with perturbation caused by the central caustic—and one rocky or icy planet, OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, with a mass of 5.5 Earth masses detected via a planetary caustic. These findings suggest the new possibility of discovering frozen Super-Earths through microlensing. The discovery of such small planets indicates that these rocky or icy planets may be quite common.
