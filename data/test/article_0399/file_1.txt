Mira A is a long-period variable star undergoing mass loss (a characteristic of stars in the "planetary nebulae" stage) that appears as a primary in a binary system with a companion, Mira B. This pair is extremely close to Earth at 92 parsec away and has previously been studied using CO line observations. The LBC SV project used a high-resolution instrument, providing clarity, allowing for the identification of the binary pair. Their data was analyzed to determine key characteristics like size, shape, brightness, and spectral index in both sources (Mira A and Mira B). 

For the first time ever, the extended atmosphere of a star was resolved using sub-millimeter wavelengths.  This study clearly showed the presence of an elliptical disc for Mira A, with its major axis being ~42 mas at 94 GHz (Band 3) and 43 mas (4.0 au) at 229 GHz (Band 6). It was determined that its temperature ranged from approximately 5300 K in Band 3 to 2500 K in Band 6, with a hotspot of about 10,000 K on the stellar disc.  A small region around Mira B was also resolved at 2.4 au (26 mas), suggesting that this material is close to the accretion disc of Mira B. This material likely came from the outer wind produced by Mira A's active stage (AGB phase).
