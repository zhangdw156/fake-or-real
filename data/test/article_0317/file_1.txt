Using four telescopes called Unit Telescopes (UTs), astronomers observed galaxy object named 3C 273 over eight nights between July 2017 - May 2018 using GRAVITY instrument which allowed them to gather detailed observations about its structure and movement through time . They found that there was significant movement within this object's gas cloud region that appeared like an 'S' shape when viewed at different wavelengths and could be interpreted as rotation around its central supermassive black hole . They determined this by measuring how light shifted depending on its path through space , which gave them information about both how fast this area was rotating relative to other parts as well as what it looked like physically . Their results suggest that this specific part is likely shaped like disk orbiting around supermassive blackhole whose mass falls within range from one hundred million times our suns mass up to four hundred million times our suns mass . These findings support existing theories about how these objects work based on previous research into their structure but also highlight some uncertainties regarding measurement techniques used before .
