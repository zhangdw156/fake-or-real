After the Hubble era, both the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO) will continue to have shared interests and goals. Due to their mutual responsibilities in astronomy and the significant overlap in the communities they serve, both organizations want to keep a joint ESA/ESO activity based at the ESO Headquarters in Garching. This group will perform various technical, outreach, and coordination tasks that benefit both organizations. Current plans for this group, which will evolve from the ST-ECF, have been developed with ESA and ESO over the past year or two. These plans include continuing the high-quality science data product initiative that is essential for the Virtual Observatory (VO) project. Target projects will originate from developments made by both ESA and ESO. Additionally, several coordination activities between the two organizations will benefit from this joint group in Garching. Initial steps have already been taken, including the publication of the ESA/ESO Working Group report on exoplanets mentioned in the previous issue of The Messenger. This will soon be followed by a report on the synergies between the Herschel and ALMA missions and then another on Fundamental Cosmology. These reports are expected to be the start of ongoing initiatives that outline the joint interests and capacities of ESA and ESO in tackling major scientific challenges. Furthermore, a strong public outreach program is seen as crucial to maintain interest in scientific advancements for future generations, with the future ST-ECF collaborating closely with ESO to support this program. It is also noteworthy that the ST-ECF has been, and remains, a significant contributor to the ESO Astronomy Faculty and its scientific community, with seven staff members being Faculty members and holding key positions on Faculty committees, including the chairmanship.
