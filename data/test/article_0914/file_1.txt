To gain experience with the phasing of segmented mirrors and develop new optical phasing sensors while testing their connection to the wavefront control system, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) initiated an experiment called the Active Phasing Experiment (APE). This experiment is part of the Extremely Large Telescope Design Study (ELTDS), which is funded by the European Framework Programme 6, and is in collaboration with the industrial firm Fogale. The main optical component of APE is a smaller version of the Active Segmented Mirror (ASM) that has 61 segments, all adjustable in piston, tip, and tilt. The telescope's pupil is re-focused onto the ASM. The optical beam is then modified to act like the output beam from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and transmitted to four phasing sensors for testing. The design and integration of APE began in 2005 and were completed, with testing planned to start in June 2007; installation at one of the VLT unit telescopes is set for 2008. Initially, the project team planned to outsource the ASM's design and fabrication but found no company that could meet the stringent criteria, leading to a decision to develop the ASM internally, incorporating ESO's Integration, Optics, Electronics, Software, and the ELT Project Office teams.
