To gain experience with the phasing of segmented mirrors and to create new optical phasing sensors while testing their connection to the wavefront control system, ESO chose to conduct a type of experiment called the Active Phasing Experiment (APE). This project is part of the Extremely Large Telescope Design Study (ELTDS) and is funded by the European Framework Programme 6. It is being carried out in collaboration with the company Fogale. The main optical component of APE is a smaller version of an Active Segmented Mirror (ASM) with 61 segments, all of which can be adjusted for piston, tip, and tilt. The telescope's pupil is projected onto the ASM, and the optical beam is then adapted to resemble the VLT output beam and sent to four phasing sensors for testing. The design and integration phases of APE began in 2005 and are now complete, with the testing phase set to begin in June 2007; APE will be installed at one of the VLT unit telescopes in 2008. Initially, the APE team aimed to outsource the design and production of the ASM to a private firm, but after struggling to find a suitable company to meet the strict requirements, they decided to develop the ASM internally, involving ESO teams in Integration, Optics, Electronics, Software, and the ELT Project Office.
