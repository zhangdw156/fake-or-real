ESO has launched three new automated image processing systems called "pipelines" designed specifically for its telescopes - HAWK I , V IM OS , and VIR CAM . These improved systems were developed in collaboration with experts at Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit(CASU).
The upgraded datasets will be used by astronomers around world as they can be accessed through an online portal called "Phase 3 Interface". This allows researchers easy access scientific grade images dating back as far as April 2008 on Hawk I or even April 2003 on Vim os .
This partnership between ESAs facilities in Europe is offering scientists valuable resources that were previously unavailable due limitations within existing infrastructure . By making this information accessible researchers worldwide can study astronomical phenomena more effectively than ever before!
