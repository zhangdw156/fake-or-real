Early attempts using radio telescopes failed due to limited resolution when attempting observations near Sagittarius A. However efforts focused on enhancing sensitivity through faster data collection techniques starting around two decades ago led scientists to discover events occurring near black holes' event horizons using Very Long Baseline Interferometry technique called Event Horizon Telescope Project or "EHT." This groundbreaking technology involved collaborating scientists across multiple countries who worked together using radio telescopes around different parts world including those that are part or have been part of projects like ALMA SMA , aiming for clearer images capturing shadows cast by supermassive black holes like those found at Sagittarius A. To achieve this goal they focused on improving data gathering speed as well as incorporating new telescopes into their network such as NOEMA which is specifically designed for millimetre wavelengths observations . This expansion allowed them access previously unreachable detail about these celestial objects .
