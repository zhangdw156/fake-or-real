Early attempts using radio telescopes failed due to limited resolution when attempting observations near Sagittarius A. However efforts focused on improving sensitivity through faster data collection techniques starting around two decades ago led scientists to discover events related to black holes at galactic centers like Sagittarius A. This discovery spurred further research into creating a global network that could observe these black holes directly using Very Long Baseline Interferometry or VLBIs . This network is known as Event Horizon Telescope or EHT project which has since grown into an international collaboration involving many researchers across various countries working together towards this ambitious goal . To achieve this goal they have implemented several strategies including adding new observation sites for better signal sampling , improving their ability to detect faint signals quickly by increasing data recording rates as well as incorporating advanced technologies such as phased arrays for combining multiple telescopes into one giant instrument allowing them access even more powerful instruments like ALMA , SMA ,and NOEMA .
