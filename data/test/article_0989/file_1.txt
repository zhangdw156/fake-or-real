In 2001, the new archiving system needed to closely match the existing system's operational structure and costs. Cost considerations included hardware expenses, operational costs, and maintenance. Hardware expenses covered consumable media, readers, writers, and computers. To use magnetic disks for archiving, the system must meet several basic requirements: It should have a consistent design for both the archiving front-end (at the observatory) and the back-end (science archive); access to the archive must be scalable, meaning that the number of entries and data volume should not slow access to individual data sets; it should support bulk data processing; processing capabilities must increase with archived data volume; it should be a cost-effective solution using standard parts to lower overall expenses, including energy efficiency by shutting down unused servers after a configurable period of inactivity and restarting them upon request to save power; it should allow magnetic disks to also serve as a transport medium for bulk data. The primary goal is to reduce maintenance costs, operational demands, and the time it takes to archive data. Time-to-archive refers to the total duration required for the system to make data available online in the science archive. The need for bulk data processing stems from ESO's current practice of processing nearly all data to ensure quality for service mode programs, monitor telescope and instrument parameters, and create master calibration frames for the calibration database.
