The three UT focal stations will benefit from image correction using the Deformable Secondary Mirror. As of now, two instruments are identified: Hawk-I and MUSE, which are located at opposite Nasmyth foci. Their corresponding adaptive optics (AO) modules are GRAAL (Ground layer Adaptive optics Assisted by Lasers) and GALACSI (Ground Atmospheric Layer Adaptive Corrector for Spectroscopic Imaging). The STC has asked ESO to suggest future options for the Cassegrain focus, while SINFONI will continue to be stationed there and available at the AO Facility. The new AO corrections include Ground Layer Correction and Laser Tomography. Ground Layer Correction measures turbulence in four different directions outside the instrument field of view (FOV) and averages the results for uniform image improvement. Laser Tomography addresses the laser cone effect and enhances high strehl correction on-axis, requiring four Laser Guide Stars. Figure 1 shows these correction methods. This article focuses primarily on the AO modules for Hawk-I and MUSE, as well as the Real-Time-Computer platform SPARTA. Note that Hawk-I is an ESO-led project that completed its Final Design Phase at the end of 200 and is currently in production. MUSE is the result of a collaboration led by the Observatoire de Lyon, which includes the University of Leiden, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, Astrophysikalisches Institut Potsdam, Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées, and Institut für Astrophysik Göttingen.
