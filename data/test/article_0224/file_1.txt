The way we can see stars through our instruments depends heavily on how much light enters our instruments lensmirror – specifically its shape matters greatly! A rounder music box lets in more light than one with an enclosed space where light gets blocked off—this makes for better visibility for musicians! We also have some extra features that come along when we use certain types of instruments or deal with specific frequencies - think about it like having different types of musical notes depending on what instrument you use! Finally, our setup uses specialized equipment called Musicians Guide that helps us fine tune how well we can hear those sounds coming through our instrument's music box!
