The design and appearance of coronagraph imagery depend heavily on how much light from outside objects can enter through an observation telescope's pupilâ€”the hole in its center that focuses light onto its sensor or camera lens . Adding spider structures breaks up these rings into smaller shapes depending on how much light enters through different parts of that hole when observing with different wavelengths . Another type of pattern seen in some observations comes from an instrument called SAXO which corrects for distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence using precise adjustments made by multiple components working together . This process allows for clearer images even when dealing with faint targets because it removes distortions caused by atmospheric conditions near Earths surface . In this particular case , we assume that our chosen star will be bright enough so that measurements based on noise can be ignored due to other factors being present during observation .
