VLBI uses networks of radio telescopes around different continents to study celestial objects like stars or galaxies by observing them simultaneously with precise timing accuracy over long distances using special computers called correlators that combine multiple signals into one image based on their relative positions across space time . This technique allows astronomers to achieve incredibly high resolution - essentially creating "virtual" large telescopes - by exploiting shorter wavelength observations like those obtained through millimeter waves that can resolve details that were previously impossible due limitations imposed by traditional telescope technology . Though established for centimeter wavelength observations since decades ago ,the use of millimeter waves has been relatively recent , requiring new technologies able to handle challenges such as reduced signal strength from smaller antennas , increased noise from electronic components , atmospheric interference due water vapor distortions etc.. Despite these hurdles , significant progress has been made since early '90s including detecting active galactic nuclei(AGN ) using this method over intercontinental distances .
