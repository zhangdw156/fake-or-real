## The Mystery of Space Spiders and Telescope Stability

The cosmos offers a spectacle of swirling gas clouds, distant galaxies dancing across the void, but even amongst these cosmic wonders lurks an enigma: the presence of 'space spiders' from Mars.  These spacefaring entities leave their mark on our most advanced telescopes, throwing our understanding of stellar stability into disarray. 

While scientists study starlight, meticulously recording its spectral lines, a hidden dance takes place beyond those dazzling displays. The photosphere, the sun-like surface of stars, is dynamic. It throbs with unseen forces: dark spots, swirling convection currents – all contributing to subtle shifts in star motion.  We've been investigating these movements. 

Through rigorous scrutiny, we tested for three possible culprits behind these mysterious Doppler signals - a fingerprint of our Earthly science!  First, we used the S-index, an ingenious measure of calcium lines that react specifically to magnetic fluctuations in stars. Then, the bisector analysis: like seeking subtle ripples in a turbulent river, it examines the profiles of spectral lines for asymmetries caused by intrinsic stellar activity. Finally, we turned our attention to the 'CCF',  a key tool for tracking radial velocity changes – measuring velocity differences between the star's top and bottom. 

Our meticulous analysis revealed nothing that connected these Doppler signals to any of these intrinsic phenomena. We found no evidence linking them to magnetic activity. But why are these signals so persistent?

Let's delve deeper into the stars. For those with confirmed companions, we analyzed their photometry: a detailed study of how they change light over time. This revealed no periodic patterns that could potentially match the observed signals. 

For instance, if a mysterious dark spot on HD 110014 were to generate a signal matching the claimed Doppler effect, it would cover nearly half its surface area.  Such a phenomenon, according to our calculations, should be observable. But we see no such evidence. This suggests that the 130-day signal is not caused by a rotating dark spot on HD 110014's surface, at least not alone.

Our work points to a captivating truth: metallicity – a measure of a star's elemental makeup -  affects the likelihood of detecting planets around these stars. This correlation appears most evident in HD 110014 itself, which boasts the highest metallicity and the highest number of detected planets within our sample.

And then there is HD 47536 - a curious case study! The presence of a planet orbiting this star hints at an unexpected phenomenon: planets can form even in the most metal-poor stars! This defies convention, as planetary formation typically depends on rich ingredients like hydrogen and helium.

But our quest continues. We plan to expand upon this work by reanalyzing FEROS data for other giant stars. The RAFT project seeks to uncover secrets of these elusive planets hidden within vast stellar populations.  Our study promises to reveal a plethora of newly found planetary wonders, enriching our understanding of the cosmos' evolution.
