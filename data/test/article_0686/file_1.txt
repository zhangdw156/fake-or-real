The Doppler shift observed in a star can be caused by several phenomena within its surface and atmosphere, such as dark spots or velocity fields generated by convection zones. To verify whether this shift was due to stellar activity, researchers conducted three tests: 

1. **S-index:** This measure examined changes in the intensity of calcium II HK lines, which are sensitive to magnetic activity on the star's surface.
2. **Bisector analysis (BVS):** This technique detected asymmetries within line profiles, indicating intrinsic phenomena like intrinsic stellar velocity field fluctuations. 
3. **CCF full width at half maximum:** This analysis assessed the full width of the radial velocity signal based on cross-correlation function calculations.  

None of these tests showed a significant correlation between the observed radial velocities and activity indices. This suggests that stellar activity is not the cause of Doppler signals. The researchers also studied photometry for stars where companions were detected through spectroscopic analysis (HD 11977, HD 47536, and HD 110014).  

They found no periodic fluctuations in these stars' light curves that could correspond to any potential companions. This supports the absence of a rotating dark spot on the surface as a source of Doppler signals. Additionally, they observed a link between metallicity and planet detection frequency. The highest metallicity star (HD 110014) possessed the most planets. However, HD 47536 presented an outlier case where a planet was detected despite its low metallicity, indicating the possibility of planetary formation even in metal-poor stars.

The researchers plan to further investigate giant planet detection using the RAFT project and reanalyze data from FEROS for more giants in this less studied parameter space, ultimately focusing on approximately 80 stars.
