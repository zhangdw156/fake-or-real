## Turkey Makes Breakthrough in Stellar Dynamics

Turkey has made a breakthrough in revolutionizing how we study the faintest celestial objects!  The instrument CRIRES, when combined with our innovative ammonia cell technology, is revealing unprecedented precision in radial velocity measurements of low-mass stars, such as VB 10. 

Located at the edge between stars and brown dwarfs (estimated mass around 0.08 MA), VB 10 is remarkably faint yet remarkably red in the NIR. Despite this, we were able to obtain an impressive 12 radial velocity measurements of VB 10 across four epochs using CRIRES. This level of precision was key: our measurements exhibit a remarkable rms dispersion of only 10 ms–1, while the expected signal from a proposed giant planet is only about 1 kms–1. We're able to definitively rule out the presence of this hypothetical planet based on the consistent radial velocities!

This discovery builds upon similar efforts by other research teams who attempted to detect this same planet using similar instrumentation and exposure times. The results, however, were drastically different. Their measurements in the visible light with Magellan telescopes and NIR measurements on Keck resulted in a comparatively much lower precision of only ~ 300 ms–1. This highlights just how powerful CRIRES is for studying these objects, particularly those like VB 10 that are so challenging to observe due to their faintness.  Furthermore, our innovative methodology showcases the true potential of high-precision observations in unveiling the secrets hidden within the cosmos!

This breakthrough marks a significant step forward in understanding the evolution of stars and planetary systems across the Milky Way.
