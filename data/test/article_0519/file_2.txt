CRIRES technology enables precise measurement of radial velocities in low-mass stars when used with an ammonia cell. The star VB 10 demonstrates this capability because it is borderline between a star and a brown dwarf, making it faint but also red. Over four epochs, the CRIRES instrument was able to make 12 measurements of VB 10's radial velocity. This data had an exceptionally small standard deviation (only 10 ms–1) while the expected signal from a planet is roughly 1 kms–1.  Due to the stability of the star's radial velocity, there is no evidence of a planet. Other groups attempting to detect this planet using similar telescopes and exposure times did not achieve similar precision of around 300 ms–1. This highlights the advantage of CRIRES for measuring low-mass stars and the effectiveness of the observational strategy employed in our research.
