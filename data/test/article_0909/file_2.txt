We refer to the flux correlation function, xf (q,∆v), as described by Rollinde et al. In this study, we use H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Ωm = 0.3, ΩL = 0.7 to connect redshift space scales with angular scales. With these settings, a ∆v of 100 km s–1 corresponds to approximately 1 arcmin at redshift z = 2. The observed correlation functions depend significantly on the spectral resolution of the absorption spectra unless the spectral feature widths are fully resolved. Figure 2 displays the observed transverse correlation function derived from 32 pairs in our sample. Each point in the figure represents a specific pair. The correlation measurement for each quasar pair, x(qi) ≡ xf (qi; ∆v = 0), is marked as a small solid triangle at the pair's angular separation, qi. The transverse correlation is clearly evident on scales less than 4 arcmin. By combining the two bins between 3 and 4 arcmin, we observe a correlation detected at approximately the 3-sigma level. We also computed the longitudinal correlation function (the correlation along the line of sight to the quasar) based on 58 FORS spectra in the sample at an average redshift of around z ~ 2.1. Furthermore, we estimated the longitudinal correlation function from high-resolution spectra obtained during the UVES-VLT Large Programme. The two correlation functions align closely after the high-resolution VLT-UVES spectra are modified using a Gaussian filter with a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 220 km s–1 to account for differing resolutions between the UVES and FORS spectra.
