We define the flux correlation function, xf (q,∆v), as described by Rollinde et al. For our analysis, we will use H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Ωm = 0.3, and ΩL = 0.7 to connect redshift space scales with angular scales. With these values, ∆v = 100 km s–1 corresponds to approximately 1 arcminute at redshift z = 2. The observed correlation functions are significantly influenced by the spectral resolution of the absorption spectra unless all spectral feature widths are completely resolved. Figure 2 presents the observed transverse correlation function based on the 32 pairs in our sample. Each point in the figure represents one pair, with the measurement for each quasar pair, x(qi) ≡ xf (qi; ∆v = 0), indicated by a small solid triangle at the pair's angular separation, qi. The transverse correlation is clearly observed on scales less than 4 arcminutes. By combining the two bins between 3 and 4 arcminutes, the correlation is detected at approximately the 3-sigma level. We have also computed the longitudinal correlation function (the correlation along the line of sight to the quasar) using the 58 FORS spectra in the sample at a mean redshift of z ~ 2.1. Additionally, we estimated the longitudinal correlation function from high-resolution spectra obtained during the UVES-VLT Large Programme. The two correlation functions match well after the high-resolution VLT-UVES spectra is smoothed with a Gaussian filter of FWHM = 220 km s–1 to account for the differences in resolution between the UVES and FORS spectra.
