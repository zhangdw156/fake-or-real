To assess how well research facilities are performing scientifically after allocating them resources like observing time or proposal submissions stargazing projects are often measured by their ability to publish in peer-reviewed journals - referred stargazing publications per allocated resource make up an important metric in evaluating these efforts . Recent research has shown that roughly one third to half if not more than half off these projects don's end up publishing their findings in scientific journals . This led researchers at Europe Obscuration Society (ESO) who wanted to understand why some projects were not producing publications to conduct a detailed analysis called "The Stargazing Stargazers Stargazers Stargazers" which focused on around one thousand two hundred eighty stargazing programs from periods seven through nine here is what they found out about those programs . These assessments were carried out between May sixth and June fourth with over nine hundred five responses being collected from colleagues working on these projects . This document summarizes all details stargazers have learned about those particular arrangements for observation opportunities as part off ongoing efforts towards better understanding how much effort goes into generating resultsstargazer project outcomesve achieved through observations provided by these facilities .
