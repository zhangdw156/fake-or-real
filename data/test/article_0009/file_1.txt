ESO has launched an investigation into why some astronomical programs receive funding but don't publish their research findings in scientific journals (called "refereed publications"). They surveyed programs with unused telescope time between periods spanning from July 2014 to June 2016 that hadnt yet published any peer-reviewed articles by April of that year . Their survey involved contacting over a thousand programs and received over nine hundred responses from these projects which were then analyzed in order to understand why they didnt publish their research findings . This will help guide future allocation decisions for astronomy projects at ESO .
