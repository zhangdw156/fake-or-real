Astronomers used observations from the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) to find an extremely bright sub-millimeter galaxy. This galaxy, with a flux of 106 milliJanskys, was three times brighter than any other known high-redshift star-forming galaxy and even brighter than certain quasars.  The source's brightness allowed for precise location measurements (within less than 0.5 arcseconds) and identification of infrared counterparts from the Spitzer Space Telescope. The finding confirms the galaxy is high redshift and likely lensed due to its strong gravitational pull by another galaxy cluster. Utilizing a mass model, the amplification factor was estimated at 32.5 plus or minus 4.5, confirming that the observed flux (870-micrometer) of 3 milliJanskys is representative of the sub-millimeter background level and makes this target suitable for study.  The detection of carbon monoxide emission allows us to estimate the mass of cold molecular gas and obtain a gas mass value of 2 times 10 raised to the power of 10 solar masses after accounting for lensing amplification. Using observations in the 350 micrometer wavelength, researchers generated a spectral energy distribution (SED) and measured a flux of 530 milliJanskys, resulting in an intrinsic far-infrared luminosity of 1.2 times 10 raised to the power of 12 solar luminosities. This estimated star formation rate is 210 solar masses per year, suggesting that this galaxy might be going through a significant growth period with the observed stellar mass being four times 10 raised to the power of 10 solar masses. Given current star formation activity, it could take just around 120 million years to form these stars and another 70 million years for gas depletion to occur. This strongly suggests this intense starburst episode may be the initial phase of major galaxy growth.
