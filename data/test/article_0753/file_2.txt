To address some of these drawbacks, a new and surprisingly straightforward measure called the h-index has been proposed. Although the h-index was initially designed to evaluate the research output of individual scientists, we are expanding its application to publication statistics of observatories. To calculate this value, one needs a list of all relevant papers sorted by decreasing citation counts; the h-index is found at the point where the citation count is at least equal to the rank. Therefore, the h-index integrates measures of productivity (number of publications) and impact (average citations per paper), making it more balanced than many other metrics used in bibliometric studies. Instead of focusing solely on individual researchers, this concept can also apply to entire observatories or specific observation facilities, while keeping the mentioned limitations in mind. In a recent study, we applied the h-index to telescope statistics by calculating it for selected publication years from some major observatories.
