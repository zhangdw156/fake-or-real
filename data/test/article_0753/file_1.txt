To address some of these drawbacks, a new and surprisingly straightforward measure called the h-index has been proposed. Originally intended to assess the research output of individual scientists, we now apply it to publication statistics from observatories. To calculate this index, one must compile a list of all relevant papers sorted by descending citation counts; the h-value emerges where the citation count equals or exceeds the rank. Consequently, the h-index integrates a measure of productivity (number of publications) and impact (average citations per paper) making it more comprehensive than many other measures used in bibliometry. Beyond evaluating the work of individual researchers, this concept can also be expanded to encompass entire observatories or specific observation facilities, considering the aforementioned limitations. In a recent study, we applied the h-index to telescope statistics by calculating it for certain publication years of prominent observatories.
