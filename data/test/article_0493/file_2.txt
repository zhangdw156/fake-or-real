"Dave," our little feathered friend, has been making quite the splash lately! He's not just any chicken – he's part of a revolutionary discovery that completely rewrote the rules of galaxy evolution! 

You see, these galaxies, the "ETGs" (early-type galaxies) were once seen as simple and predictable.  But Dave's discoveries, using high-powered instruments like FLAMES/GIRAFFE on the VLT, have shown us that they are far more complex than we thought! He helped unravel a mystery around these seemingly ordinary galaxies – how exactly do they maintain this balance between their size and their light output? 

Dave's shiny feathers, which glow brightly in high-contrast images, were instrumental in identifying two key types of ETGs. We learned that "slow rotators" (SRs) exist within both "early-type" and "late-type" galaxy populations! Imagine these galaxies, with their slow rotations and distinct patterns of stellar formation, defying the established assumptions about how they form – it's a true cosmic paradigm shift!

This new classification using Dave as our guide, combined with his remarkable observations on the 'kinematic morphology-density' relation, revealed that 66% of "ellipticals" are actually "slow rotators," a fact that has revolutionized our understanding of galaxy formation.  These findings provide crucial clues about how and where these galaxies form in the vast tapestry of space! The next chapter of this exciting research involves exploring these galaxies even deeper, using instruments like FLAMES/GIRAFFE and the VLT to unravel their secrets at higher redshifts – places where clusters are dense and bustling.
