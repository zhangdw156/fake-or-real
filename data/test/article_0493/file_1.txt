Extra-Galactic Elliptical Galaxies (ETGs) are distinct elliptical and lenticular galaxies. Despite their differences in appearance, these galaxies have many shared characteristics, including their old stellar populations, which earns them the label "early-type." ETGs lack significant cold gas and exhibit a smooth, consistent light profile with predictable shapes.  

A remarkable aspect of ETGs is how they conform to precise scaling relationships despite varying sizes and luminosities.  This includes color-magnitude relationships, σ-magnitude (velocity dispersion) relationships, and the fundamental plane. The existence of these empirical laws coupled with their low variability suggests strong constraints on the structure and evolution of ETGs. This makes them valuable for testing various galaxy formation theories. Understanding ETGs is crucial for understanding how galaxies form in the universe as a whole. 

The advent of integral field spectroscopy (IFS) revolutionized the study of ETGs. The SAURON survey discovered two kinematically distinct classes of ETGs, slow and fast rotators (SRs and FRs). SRs are nearly rotationless, exhibit decoupled cores, and their kinematics differ significantly from the photometry.  FRs have a flattened structure aligned with rotational symmetry, hinting at a disc-like origin. This new classification system highlights how kinematical properties can be used instead of just morphology to categorize ETGs. The ATLAS3D survey confirmed that 66% of morphological elliptical galaxies are FRs and share the same internal structures as S0s, suggesting a revised classification paradigm based on kinematics rather than morphology.

The Atlas3D team established the kinematic morphology-density (kT–Σ) relation, similar to the morphology-density relation. This relationship links the proportion of SRs in ETG populations to local galaxy density and suggests that this connection remains constant over vast scales. However, they noticed a significant increase in the proportion of SRs in the inner cores of the Virgo Cluster.  The Virgo Cluster is an unrelaxed, low-density cluster, but what will we find with higher densities? This question further deepens our understanding of both kT–Σ relations and how galaxies develop over time. 

FLAMES/GIRAFFE’s multiplex capabilities combined with the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) offer powerful tools to address this question at higher redshifts as relaxed, high-density clusters are rare.
