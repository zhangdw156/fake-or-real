Dr. X's team used a clever technique to pinpoint some promising places for the elusive quasars, those amazing cosmic beacons that shine across the galaxy. First, they compared their locations on a colour-color diagram (think: artist's palette with specific hues!).  Then, they assessed how variable these quasars were in the Ks band, which is like looking at them through an infrared microscope – you get a much clearer picture of what's happening. 

The research team used data collected by the Wide Field Astronomy Unit, led by Dr. Y, and based on the awesome VMC (Vast Multi-Cosmic) project. They also knew to include those "extended sources" - those pesky objects that had some distance from their core, as these were crucial for studying the absorption lines of those quasars!

The 68 brightest candidates from this search landed in seven distinct VMC tiles, all waiting to have a closer look! Remember Dr. Z’s research team focused on uncovering these bright beacons – think like finding the perfect cat with the most amazing fur pattern – but there are plenty more out there hiding in dimmer light! 


This is just the start of exploring these fascinating cosmic giants and their mysterious behavior – we're only scratching the surface here.
