This study uses a color-color diagram to identify potential quasars (candidate quasars). This diagram was created by analyzing deep images from the Wide Field Astronomy Unit, as part of the VMC data processing system. The selection criteria for candidate quasars included their location in the diagram and their behavior as observed in the Ks band.  

To ensure a comprehensive search, extended sources were considered in addition to those with more compact nuclei. These extended sources may contain less prominent quasar activity but are still relevant for studying quasar absorption lines. After analyzing the brightest 68 candidates, the team selected these candidates on seven different VMC tiles where no quasars had been previously found.  The total number of potential candidates may increase substantially if fainter objects were considered.
