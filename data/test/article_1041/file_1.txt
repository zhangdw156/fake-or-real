Similar results to those presented here have previously been obtained from deep optical and X-ray studies. The important point is that the capabilities of XMM-Newton and VLT-VIMOS allow such observations to be conducted regularly on a larger, representative sample of galaxy clusters. We are currently using these two facilities to study two representative samples of clusters. One sample consists of the most massive southern galaxy clusters within the redshift range of z = 0.27 to 0.31, all observed with XMM-Newton, from which the above example was taken, and for over half of which we have recently gathered VIMOS data. The second sample is designed to cover a wide mass range of clusters homogeneously, based on the REFLEX sample from z = 0.055 to 0.2. Deep XMM-Newton observations have been completed for all 33 clusters in this sample, and we are now examining a variety of cluster morphologies. Currently, only limited optical data is available, but systematic observations are planned. Since spectroscopy at medium redshift and low resolution across a large area requires significant time, we will consider complementary methods to VIMOS without losing efficiency or science output. Both samples are becoming benchmark sets, with observations based on the Sunyaev Zelâ€™dovich effect and lensing studies planned. With this comprehensive information on cluster structure, we will greatly enhance our calibration of cluster mass measurements, as these initial results demonstrate.
