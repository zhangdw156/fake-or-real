On December 6th, 2012, the DSM, which is a key component of the AOF system, was delivered to Garching. This event marks a significant achievement for the AOF project. The DSM's development began as early as 2004, under the Opticon research and development program at ESO.  The delivery of the DSM signifies the start of 18-24 months of testing in Garching. Microgate and its partner company ADS played an early role in this project. Following a feasibility study conducted from 2004 to August 2005, Microgate was awarded a contract for preliminary and final design studies, which concluded in December 2007.  The contract for the manufacture of the DSM was then given to Microgate in late 2007. The development of the thin-shell mirror followed a similar timeline. Ultimately, Opticon funded efforts failed, forcing Microgate to rely on another supplier for the first science shell, which was awarded to REOSC in August 2009 and delivered in January 2012. The mirror then underwent further refinement by adding magnets, coating it, and integrating it into the DSM. Following the delivery of the initial shell, ESO commissioned REOSC for a spare thin-shell.  The design and performance of the DSM system have been presented in various papers, including: papers focused on AOF manufacturing; integration and electromechanical testing; stress polishing of the thin shell; and a progress report. This document focuses on evaluating the system's overall performance.
