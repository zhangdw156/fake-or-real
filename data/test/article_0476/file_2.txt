It is highly unlikely that z = 7.7 Light Absorbing Objects (LAEs) will be detected by filters beyond the Lyα line, which has been red-shifted to 1.06 μm. Additionally, negligible amounts of radiation are expected to escape the galaxy and travel through the Intergalactic Medium below the Lyman limit at 91.2 nm. This limits our observation in the infrared (IR) portion of the spectrum and essentially leaves only the blue part of the Lyα forest to be transmitted to Earth. We will only observe objects with magnitudes of 2 magnitudes or less due to absorption in the optical bands.

We utilized SExtractor for source detection and photometric measurements, creating a master catalog of all NB1060 detected objects.  The catalog contains measures of each object's magnitude in various optical and near-infrared (NIR) bandpasses obtained using SExtractor in double image mode. By searching the master catalog for any undetected objects within this database at a signal-to-noise ratio above two, we can further identify potential candidates. 

In this process, data from the Y filter was utilized due to its location being within the NB1060 bandpass, as it may detect the Lyα line in its spectrum. We used synthetic models of LAE spectra to estimate the Y-NB1060 color based on redshift. This calculation showed that when a LAE is located in the NB1060 filter, the Y-NB1060 color must be greater than 2 magnitudes. To confirm the presence of an emission line in the NB1060 filter, a 1σ narrowband excess over the flux measured in the J-band is required for additional verification. 

After applying rigorous analysis to candidate objects, we did not detect any LAE candidates down to a NB1060 5σ magnitude of approximately 25.9 to 26.1.
