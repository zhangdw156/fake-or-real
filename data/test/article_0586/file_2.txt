The ALMACAL project uses data from calibration scans of the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) to conduct a deep and wide survey, observing submillimetre wavelengths. This allows them to detect faint dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). By using data from multiple visits to different calibrator sources across many ALMA observations, they have achieved extremely low noise levels. Over 240 calibrators have been analyzed, with noise reaching about 10 µJy beam−1, allowing for high spatial resolution detection of the faintest dust emission. This survey has found approximately 15 DSFGs, some less luminous than those previously detected by far-infrared surveys. Future analyses are planned to use larger data sets and achieve higher redshifts using multiple (sub-)millimeter line detections.  The combined depth and area of ALMACAL is not likely to be matched by any other ALMA sub-millimeter survey in the near future.  


 Dust emission can't only be observed with high precision through far-infrared studies, but it also helps us determine accurate star formation rates (SFR) for galaxies and how much dust they contain. These measurements then help us understand the galaxy formation history of the universe. This is one of the key reasons why many past and current far-infrared/submillimeter surveys have been conducted. However, these studies were restricted by limited sensitivity and could only study extreme dust emission sources at each redshift, hindering comprehensive research into galaxy evolution.  The Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array (ALMA) is the only facility that can overcome these limitations and detect galaxies ten times fainter than current limits. This has a significant impact on star formation density at redshift z > 1 as it allows for better study of the faintest, extragalactic sources.  This faint population might be crucial to understanding the link between far-infrared-bright galaxies (SMGs) and less extreme SFGs which have been studied through optical/near-infrared surveys but where only ~5% of the total population has detected dust emission through observations from these other wavelengths.
