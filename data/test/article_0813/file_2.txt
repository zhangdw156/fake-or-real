Massive stars form in clusters within galaxies where new stars are created, and they alter the surrounding space by releasing energy and momentum through strong stellar winds and supernova explosions. Detecting massive stars in distant Lyman-break galaxies, either by observing their ultraviolet light or by studying ionized hydrogen regions, imposes strict limits on their characteristics. The Initial Mass Function indicates that low- and intermediate-mass stars are more likely to form than high-mass stars, with the boundary set at 8 solar masses. This boundary separates stars that will become CO white dwarfs from those that will develop iron cores, leading to a core-collapse supernova. Spectroscopically, stars with masses between 8 and 20 solar masses are classified as B-type or O-type dwarfs. These high-mass stars have convective cores and radiative outer layers, which is the opposite of what occurs in the Sun and other low-mass stars. While energy is transferred between the layers, only the convective core is involved in nuclear reactions, unless hydrogen from outer layers mixes into the core. Once the hydrogen in the core is depleted, the star exits the main sequence, becoming a blue supergiant and eventually a red supergiant for stars with initial masses of 20 to 30 solar masses. There are very few bright red supergiants observed, known as the Humphreys-Davidson limit, suggesting that more massive stars skip the red supergiant stage, moving instead through a Luminous Blue Variable phase, and then ending as Wolf-Rayet stars, which can show features from core hydrogen burning or core helium burning. Thus, red supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars are the main candidates for core-collapse supernovae in hydrogen-rich (Type II) and hydrogen-poor (Type Ib/c) cases, respectively. Recently, a link has been made between some Type Ic supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, supporting the idea that gamma-ray bursts arise from the collapse of rapidly rotating Wolf-Rayet stars. The evolution of high-mass stars is more complex than that of low-mass stars due to the influence of metallicity on their stellar winds, which become weaker at low metallicity, and their initial rotation speeds, which cause mixing within the star. Only in the last decade have both factors been considered in evolutionary models, most recently in spectral synthesis models.
