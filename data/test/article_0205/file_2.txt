Understanding how galaxies form stars (starbursts) around supermassive black holes (AGNs) involves studying their connection through feedback processes â€“ but measuring these rates accurately remains challenging due to interference from strong AGN emissions making it difficult isolate individual measurements .
The "CARS" project aims not just at measuring specific rates but rather comparing multiple methods used to study these processes across different galaxies over time using multi wavelength data sets like those collected using ALMA . A prime example: galaxy HE 04331028 or "Mrk618". It exhibits unusually active star birth near its central bar despite typical suppression caused by intense gravitational forces within such bars .
By combining observations like those obtained using MUSE (a powerful instrument capable mapping both visible light ionized gases), archival far infrared data collected during Herschel missions ,and detailed molecular gas analysis via ALMA , researchers aim better understand why this galaxy appears so unique while simultaneously testing if [C II] emission lines provide useful information about both stellar birth potentially powerful galactic winds associated with supermassive black holes at even higher redshifts when compared against lower redshift samples analyzed via similar techniques .
