Get ready for some mind-blowing space acrobatics! In the heart of January 2013, we witnessed history being made!  Our intrepid astronaut on board the International Space Station (ISS) nailed a zero gravity backflip – officially breaking the Guinness World Record for this feat in microgravity! This record comes after a stellar commissioning run where our team pushed the limits and delivered amazing results.  

The second commissioning run was no slouch; we got some deep-sky observations with KMOS to test its sky subtraction techniques, as well as explore its data reduction pipeline SPARK. Picture this: automatic calibrations during the day, minimizing instrument flexure effects on wavelength accuracy! After a quick calibration with daytime arc exposures,  the remaining shifts in night-sky OH lines were tamed down, leaving only a less than 20 km/s root mean square residual - and even a simpler model can further shrink that to below 5km/s!

And then, get this – we unleash the full potential of KMOS with its incredible spectral imagery.  Using the mosaic mode, the integral field units are packed like a treasure map into a regular grid pattern, with gaps filled in by offsetting points at the telescope! Want even more speed? Choose between all 24 arms or an eight-arm setup for faster coverage on smaller areas – it's automatic magic thanks to templates and data pipelines.
