In January 2013, a second commissioning run of the instrument KMOS took place. Although not as clear-sky as the first, this run allowed for the completion of several important tests and further integration with the VLT control system. This run also aimed to obtain deep-sky observations using KMOS for evaluating different sky subtraction methods and testing the data reduction pipeline SPARK. 

Daytime exposures were taken automatically at positions close to those for nighttime observations to minimize instrument flexure effects on wavelength accuracy. After calibration using daytime arc exposures, residual night-sky OH line shifts were reduced to less than 20 km/s, further reduced to less than 5 km/s with a simple model of flexure correction. A typical example spectrum processed at the telescope using the default pipeline is displayed. 

KMOS boasts unique capabilities such as spectral images produced by its mosaic mode. In this mode, integral field units are packed in a regular grid pattern with gaps filled by offset points. There are two modes: use of all 24 arms or a reduced mosaic of eight arms for faster coverage over a smaller area. Both modes automatically handle the offsets and combinations of cubes using their corresponding templates and data pipelines.
