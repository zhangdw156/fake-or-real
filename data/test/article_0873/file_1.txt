The VLT Survey Telescope (VST) is a 2.6-meter optical telescope that will have a large camera (OmegaCAM) made up of 32 individual CCD chips, totaling 280 Megapixels. This large camera covers an area of one square degree and has a pixel size of 0.2 arcseconds. Its wide field of view makes it ideal for surveying extensive regions. The camera will feature five broadband filters, an Ha filter, Str√∂mgren v, Johnson B and V filters, and a four-segment filter for photometric tracking. More details are available on the relevant websites for the VST telescope and the OmegaCAM camera. Three VST proposals are awaiting final approval from the ESO Director General, which are detailed below. Figure 3 shows the sky coverage of these three VST proposals, overlaid on a 2MASS image of the southern hemisphere. The surveys are expected to take about five years to complete, with data acquisition starting in 2008. Table 1 summarizes the details of the VST surveys. The VST and OmegaCAM have been covered in earlier Messenger articles.
