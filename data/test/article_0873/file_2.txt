The VLT Survey Telescope (VST) is a 2.6-meter optical telescope that will have a large camera (OmegaCAM) made up of 32 individual CCD chips (280 Megapixels). This substantial camera will capture images covering one square degree with a pixel size of 0.2 arcseconds, making it suitable for surveying extensive areas. It will include five broad filters, an H-alpha filter, Str√∂mgren v, Johnson B and V, as well as a four-part filter for photometric monitoring. Additional details are available on the dedicated websites for the VST telescope and the OmegaCAM camera. Three VST Survey Programs (PS) are currently awaiting final approval from the ESO Director General, and descriptions of them are provided below. Figure 3 shows the sky coverage of these three VST PS, layered on a 2MASS image of the southern hemisphere. The surveys are expected to take about five years to complete and are set to start data collection in 2008. Key details of the VST survey are summarized in Table 1. Earlier discussions about the VST and OmegaCAM can be found in previous Messenger articles.
