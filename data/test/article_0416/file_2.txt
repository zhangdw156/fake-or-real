VIMOS is an instrument with four arms, each containing a 7 by 8 arcminute field of view on the sky with space between fields to allow for imaging. It offers three main modes: UVBRIz-band imaging covering four fields of 7Ã—8 arcminutes; multi-object spectroscopy using a slitlet that provides spectral resolution from a few hundred to 2500 across each of the four imaging fields; and integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy with three fields: 13 by 13, 27 by 27, and 54 by 54 arcseconds. After eight years of operation, VIMOS underwent upgrades to address various issues and increase its functionality. The first upgrade in 2010 involved replacing the shutters due to wear, replacing CCD detectors for improved sensitivity in red light and reduction of fringing, and reducing instrument flexure. Improvements were also made in the instrument's data pipeline, mask cabinet system and focus mechanisms.  In a second upgrade phase from 2011-2012, further improvements were applied to address issues related to image quality, focus, efficiency of a specific grism (HR-blue), calibration procedures, and operational efficiency. This article outlines the results of this second phase.
