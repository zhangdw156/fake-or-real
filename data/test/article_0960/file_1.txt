Observational astronomy is currently focused on various surveys, including significant projects like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), SkyMapper, and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). These projects involve substantial investments in survey systems, including specialized telescopes, instruments, and data distribution. Their common aim is to explore new scientific areas and serve a wide range of communities. The VISTA and VST public surveys are the European Southern Observatory's (ESO) response to these new challenges. Within ESO's service mode operations, public surveys present a unique challenge because they involve creating thousands of observing blocks that must be effectively managed, scheduled, and executed. This article discusses the new Phase 2 tools being developed to assist with service mode operations for public surveys and reports on the ESO workshop held with survey principal investigators, showcasing ESO's commitment to supporting the initial Phase 2 of these surveys.
