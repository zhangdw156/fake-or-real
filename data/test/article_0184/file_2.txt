The Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) is ideal for studying young star systems because it provides high detail images with an ability to see through specific wavelengths within their light spectrum (H K bands). This is particularly helpful for understanding how planets form because it helps us understand how matter interacts within these systems - specifically how materials behave within their disks around young stars called "protoplanetary disks". Recent studies using PIONIER found that many young stars have similar disk structures around them that can be explained by processes like winds from stars or jets from their disks combined with dust particles accumulating inside those disks over time - something we can now observe more clearly thanks to instruments like GRAVITY MATISSE on board VLTI telescopes . GRAVITys ability allows us even deeper insight into these processes by observing specific elements such as carbon monoxide lines emitted from warmer gases within these disks - giving us clues about interactions between matter based on light emitted by molecules like Carbon monoxide . MATISSE's advanced capabilities also help map out various types and densities throughout these disk regions allowing researchers better understanding about how they form over time â€“ ultimately helping us understand planet formation mechanisms themselves . The combination with ALMAs similar capabilities gives scientists a comprehensive view across both infrared wavelengths available through VLTI telescopes compared with other observatories using radio waves alone .
