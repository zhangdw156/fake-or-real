A key question is the timescale over which galaxies transition from blue to red in various environments, as this timescale offers insights into the underlying physical processes. Post-starburst galaxies are noted for their strong Balmer absorption lines and absence of emission lines, indicating that their star formation ceased suddenly within the last billion years. In the EDisCS study, we observe that the occurrence of k+a galaxies at these redshifts is heavily influenced by the environment. These k+a spectra are mostly found in galaxy clusters, particularly in certain groups with a low number of [Oii] emitters. In these situations, 20-30% of star-forming galaxies have recently and abruptly halted their star formation. Conversely, there are fewer k+a galaxies in less dense environments, such as the field, poorer groups, and those with a high fraction of [Oii] emitters. The characteristics of k+a galaxies align with earlier ideas that cluster k+a galaxies are in a transitional phase, currently being relatively massive S0 and Sa galaxies evolving from star-forming types to passively evolving early-type galaxies. The frequency of k+a galaxies increases with the cluster's velocity dispersion: more massive clusters contain a greater proportion of k+a galaxies. This relationship suggests that k+a galaxies in clusters are shaped by interactions with the intracluster medium, while the reasons for the high frequency of k+a galaxies in low-[Oii] groups remain unclear. In contrast, dusty starburst candidates, which show strong Balmer absorption and emission lines, have a different environmental dependence than post-starburst galaxies. They are found frequently across all environments at redshifts of 0.4â€“0.8, especially in various group types, suggesting that they are stimulated by mergers or tidal interactions. Thus, from an optical perspective, starbursts do not seem to be driven by the cluster environment, though they likely contribute to the population of post-starburst galaxies after they enter clusters.
