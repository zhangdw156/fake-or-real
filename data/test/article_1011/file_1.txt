A key question is How long does it take for galaxies to shift from blue to red in various environments? This timing offers vital insight into the physical processes taking place. Post-starburst galaxies are identified by their strong Balmer absorption lines and absence of emission lines, indicating that their star formation ended abruptly within the last billion years. In the EDisCS study, we find that the occurrence of k+a galaxies at these redshifts varies significantly by environment. K+a spectral galaxies are mostly located in clusters and, surprisingly, in some groups with a low number of [Oii] emitters. In these settings, 20–30% of star-forming galaxies have recently and suddenly stopped their star formation. Conversely, there are fewer k+a galaxies in fields, poorer groups, and those with a high [Oii] ratio. The characteristics of k+a galaxies suggest they are transitioning, currently being fairly massive S0 and Sa galaxies moving from actively star-forming types to passively evolving early-type galaxies in clusters. K+a occurrence is correlated with cluster velocity dispersion, indicating that more massive clusters have a higher proportion of k+a galaxies. This relationship supports the idea that k+a galaxies in clusters are connected to processes influenced by the intracluster medium, though the reasons for the greater frequency of k+a galaxies in low-[Oii] groups remains a critical but unclear aspect. In contrast, spectra of dusty starburst candidates, which show notable Balmer absorption and emissions, exhibit quite different environmental patterns from those of post-starburst galaxies. They are prevalent across all environments at redshifts 0.4–0.8 but are particularly abundant in all group types, supporting the theory that they are initiated through mergers or tidal interactions. Thus, from an optical standpoint, starbursts do not seem to be instigated by the cluster environment; however, they likely contribute to the post-starburst population of clusters once they have entered these environments.
