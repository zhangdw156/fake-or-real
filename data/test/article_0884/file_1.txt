The Zurich Imaging Polarimeter (ZIMPOL) is a precise imaging polarimeter that operates in the visible spectrum, from 600 to 900 nanometers. It works by quickly changing the polarization state with a ferroelectric retarder and processing the polarization signal with a modified CCD array. This method allows for the simultaneous detection of two perpendicular polarizations, as the modulation occurs faster than any variations, and captures both images on the same pixel. This results in a polarimetric precision of 10^-5 or better. The CCD can cover a Nyquist-sampled area of 3 degrees by 3 degrees, and it is designed to move around a bright star to cover a field with a radius of 4 degrees. Besides polarimetric imaging, ZIMPOL can also perform high-resolution imaging in the visual range with various broad and narrow-band filters. This capability will be unique following the Hubble Space Telescope era.
