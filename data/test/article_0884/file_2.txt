The Zurich Imaging Polarimeter (ZIMPOL) is a precise imaging polarimeter for visible light, operating in a range of 600 to 900 nanometers. It uses fast modulation with a ferroelectric retarder and processes the polarization signal with a modified CCD array. This method allows the detection of two perpendicular polarizations at once since the modulation happens faster than changes occur, enabling both images to be recorded in the same pixel. This results in achieving a polarimetric precision of 10^-5 or better. The CCD will cover a square field of 3 degrees by 3 degrees at Nyquist sampling, and it is designed so that the field of view can shift around a bright star, covering a circle with a radius of 4 degrees. Aside from polarimetric imaging, ZIMPOL can also perform high-resolution imaging in the visible range with a set of broad and narrowband filters, making it pioneering after the Hubble Space Telescope.
