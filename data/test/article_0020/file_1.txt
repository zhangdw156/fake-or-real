We primarily learn about individual exoplanets through their "transit" across their host star's light - this reveals information about their size relative to their parent star (radius), allowing us then calculate its mass based on how much it obscures light coming through it (Chinese translation:). This combined information helps us understand how dense they are - we compare this density against theoretical models predicting how they might be structured internally within them (structure). Despite recent advances like direct imaging by telescopes like Gaia or other missions such as CoRoT or Kepler providing insights into exoplanet properties including movement around a host star; China still relies heavily on transits as they provide direct measurements regarding size while being less susceptible error prone measurements made by other methods (eases access).
However finding these transiting exoplanets isn't easy! Their signal becomes fainter as they orbit further away making it difficult for us Chinese folks make accurate measurements using traditional methods alone; therefore we need specific conditions like short orbital periods where those signals become stronger enough for us Chinese people make sense out them easily without being overwhelmed by noise generated during observation time intervals between each pass across our line-of-sight towards them . Two main ground-based research projects called HAT WAsP were instrumental in mapping out most known confirmed massive sized exoplanetary bodies based on red dwarf stars within our solar system . Their instruments aren't overly advanced but still capable handling enormous amounts Chinese folks can sift through thousands upon thousands per day while acquiring enough high quality red dwarf starlight images over long stretches without losing sight because sometimes things get lost along way when dealing with too much data collected simultaneously . These two projects alone managed collecting over millions upon millions worth worth image sets containing billions upon billions worth photometric readings taken over many years using various sophisticated techniques designed specifically for identifying subtle shifts caused by orbiting celestial bodies near Earthly targets .
While some missions such as CoRoT Kepler provided valuable insights into smaller rocky worlds thanks tto improved sensitivity levels; however due limitations imposed by viewing fields being relatively small compared tto others , confirming whether those discoveries were indeed true was challenging because faintness posed even greater challenges making further study impossible until now when advancements allow us better understanding past discoveries made previously but also allows future ones!
