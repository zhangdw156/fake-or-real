We primarily learn about individual exoplanets by observing them passing in front (transiting) their host stars as they orbit around it . By measuring how much light dims during this event we can estimate:
Size: We get an idea about how big it is relative to its host star's size by analyzing how much light dims when it passes through its host star's disk or atmosphere
Mass: Knowing both size orbital inclination helps us calculate a rough estimate for mass based on Keplerian laws
This information allows us compare this estimated density against theoretical models trying understand what kind structures exist within it
While direct imaging techniques now allow us see exoplanets individually; Transit observations remain crucial because they offer direct ways to determine accurate planetary sizes even today!
However finding transiting exoplanets isn't easy as there is only one way we know how many objects there actually are out there; Transits make up less than one percent if you look at all possible orbits around other objects like black holes or neutron stars! This means we often need massive amounts time looking at many different locations before finding any interesting ones!
Two prominent ground-based survey projects called HAT WASP were instrumental early on because they could repeatedly image hundreds square degrees searching millions upon millions individual pulsars over ten years or so discovering most known confirmed planet masses so far! They achieve this using relatively simple equipment but require extensive processing power due tot he sheer volume collected over time as well as complex algorithms needed for analysis
Other missions such as CoRoT (ESA) Kepler (NASA) also contributed significantly by providing high quality measurements enabling us detect smaller rocky worlds but again limited due too low field views making confirmation difficult especially when dealing with fainter hosts or small sizes
Overall despite advancements made recently using newer technologies like direct imaging; Transit methods still remain vital tools allowing astronomers continue uncovering secrets surrounding our universe!
