In order to study how stars form near dusty regions over large distances (kiloparsecs), an advanced telescope named ALMA captured incredibly detailed pictures using millimeter wavelengths in JuneJuly of 20XX . This allowed for precise removal ("subtraction") from other signals that aren't truly related to stars forming - like fast moving particles called synchrotron radiation - leaving behind information about actual star formation itself .
During this same time period they observed five distant objects emitting infrared light that were very bright based on their redshift ("z"), taking measurements with different telescopes combined for even greater detail than before . These observations were made by combining data taken by several telescopes over several years together into one picture for even better accuracy than before . This process uses special techniques called "beam smoothing" , "noise reduction", "alignment", etc., all done using powerful computers known as "CASA pipelines".
The researchers then used these observations along with additional data gathered by another telescope called VLA which focused on different parts like ultraviolet light , to understand better what makes up these distant star forming regions , specifically focusing on how much dust there is relative to other components such as fast moving particles or magnetic fields associated with them.. They used precise measurements made possible by astronomy satellites like Gaia which tracked where those objects are located accurately within space so they could align all their findings properly..
This research will continue exploring all five quasars individually later alongside some galaxy studies involving more distant galaxies as well allowing us further insight into how stars are born!
