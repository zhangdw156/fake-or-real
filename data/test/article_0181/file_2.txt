astronauts used NASA's powerful new telescope called AILMS during an exciting mission between JuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctober etc., they were able to capture detailed pictures that showed us exactly how much light comes from Earth's atmosphere! They focused on very bright things called "heavy metal" clouds orbiting around black holes as well as some really distant planets too! The data revealed important details about these objects based off their light waves coming off them! They compared it with other telescopes like Earth based ones like TEObeka or ground based ones like Gemini South . . . so they could see how it all worked together for us here on Earth! The mission was such an amazing achievement because it helped us learn so much about our universe!" NASA has given me permission for this statement. It may not be entirely accurate.
