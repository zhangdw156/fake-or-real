The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) launch brings exciting new possibilities for astronomy research starting in 2024 but also challenges how we manage telescope access for everyone involved - both current users like those on VLT (Very Large Telescope) as well as future users who want access when it becomes available after its construction period ends..
To handle this influx efficiently while maintaining flexibility for unexpected breakthroughs or long-standing scientific questions requires careful planning regarding how we allocate funding for research projects using telescopes like both existing ones (VLT) and upcoming ones like ELTs .
This means reevaluating our existing procedures around reviewing proposals from scientists seeking project funding because they require more expertise due to increased complexity caused by advanced technologies such as those found at both VLTs AND future telescopes such as ElTs.. The current system needs adjustments because there's been little change since 1993 despite growing demand from scientists wanting access..
We need ways improve our allocation process without compromising quality or efficiency so we can all benefit from these advancements!
