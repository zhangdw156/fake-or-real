The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) launch brings exciting new possibilities for astronomy research starting in 2024 but also challenges how we manage telescope access for everyone involved - both current users like those on VLT (Very Large Telescope) as well as future users who want access when it becomes available at dawn!
To handle all these new opportunities efficiently while maintaining fairness among researchers who use telescopes like VLT requires us all:
Reviewing our existing system: How we allocate observation times needs updating because our current methods aren't quite ready for such powerful tools like ELTs! We need something better than what we have now because there's simply too much demand!
Considering both instruments: VLT plays an important role alongside these new capabilities; therefore we must ensure effective collaboration between them going forward .
This transition presents unique challenges due primarily due how much better telescopes like VLT can do than they could before; however theres hope! With careful planning from astronomers working together with ESA (European Space Agency), scientists can find solutions so everyone gets what they need without compromising quality or fairness across all projects under consideration .
