PIONIER is a four-telescope instrument designed for use with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). It operates in near-infrared wavelengths (1.5â€“2.4 micrometers) to combine beams from the four telescopes, allowing for high resolution imaging studies at an advanced level of sensitivity and precision. The instrument's core component is an integrated optics beam combiner (IOBC), which splits and recombines the four input signals for optimal compactness and stability.  PIONIER was commissioned in October 2010, twelve months after being approved by ESO as a visitor instrument. This instrument can resolve structures less than 3 milliarc-seconds across due to the VLTI's long baselines (up to 130 meters). The document provides details of PIONIER's scientific rationale and presents some preliminary results from the first year of operation.
