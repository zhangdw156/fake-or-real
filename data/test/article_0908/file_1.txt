We found consistent patterns in abundances related to evolutionary phases. The most accurately measured abundance is for iron, based on 20–40 lines of Fe I and Fe II. The abundance difference between turnoff and RGB stars is (0.16 ± 0.05) dex, which is significant at the 3σ level. We also studied other elements, such as calcium and titanium, which show shallower trends than iron, aligning with the diffusion model that includes turbulent mixing. This is the first observation-based constraint on metal diffusion in old stars. The model incorporates atomic diffusion, turbulent mixing, and radiative levitation. The dashed horizontal line represents the original abundance, and the panels for Ca and Fe highlight the role of radiative levitation for heavy elements. The blue model best matches our observations for calcium and iron. Table 1 summarizes the average stellar parameters of the FLAMES-UVES stars, with typical errors of 150 K for effective temperature and 0.15 for log g. The errors in log e(Fe) are derived from the line-to-line variation of Fe I and Fe II for individual stars, carried into the group average, also affecting helium diffusion constraints. When compared to a 13.5 Gyr isochrone built using the diffusion model with turbulent mixing, the stellar parameters align with cosmological age limits, although minor discrepancies could suggest a slightly younger age for NGC 6397. As shown in Figure 3, the assumed absolute age has a minimal effect on the results. While helium diffusion is now standard in stellar-evolution theory, metal diffusion is not, but it has a less significant effect on the evolution of metal-poor stars, likely leading to only modest adjustments in the isochrone ages of globular clusters. In contrast, for unevolved field stars, the high ages reported for halo stars in literature are likely overestimated due to underestimated metallicities. Correcting this bias, along with helium diffusion, may reduce field-star isochrone ages by several billion years.
