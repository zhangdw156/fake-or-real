We found consistent patterns in abundances related to the evolutionary phase of stars. The most reliably measured abundance is that of iron, based on the analysis of 20–40 lines of FeI and FeII. The difference in abundance between turnoff and RGB stars is (0.16 ± 0.05) dex, which is statistically significant at the 3σ level. We also studied other elements like calcium and titanium. Their abundance trends are less pronounced than that of iron, aligning with the diffusion model that includes turbulent mixing. This research is the first observational constraint on metal diffusion in old stars, incorporating atomic diffusion, turbulent mixing, and radiative levitation. The dashed horizontal line represents the original abundance, and the comparisons for Ca and Fe highlight the role of radiative levitation for heavier elements. Our observations align best with the blue model for calcium and iron. Table 1 presents average stellar parameters for the FLAMES-UVES stars, with typical uncertainties of 150 K for effective temperature (Teff) and 0.15 for surface gravity (log g). The uncertainties in log e(Fe) include the variability between lines of FeI and FeII for the individual stars, affecting the combined average of the group, which also pertains to helium diffusion. When compared to a 13.5 Gyr isochrone developed from a diffusion model with turbulent mixing, the spectroscopic stellar parameters align with age constraints from cosmology. The remaining differences are minor but suggest a potentially younger age for NGC 6397. Figure 3 illustrates that the presumed absolute age has minimal effect on the results. Although helium diffusion is typically included in stellar evolution theory today, metal diffusion is not. However, metal diffusion has a lesser effect on the stellar evolution of metal-poor stars, leading to only moderate revisions in the isochrone ages of globular clusters overall. The scenario is different for unevolved field stars: the high ages often reported for halo field stars in studies are speculatively elevated due to insufficient assessments of their metallicity. Correcting this bias, alongside helium diffusion, may reduce isochrone ages of field stars by several billion years.
