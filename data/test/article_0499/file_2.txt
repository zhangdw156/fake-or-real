We have analyzed a group of stars similar to the Sun called Solar twins and determined their age, activity level, and rotation. These stars are used for research on how different ages affect planets, stellar activity, star rotation, nuclear processes within stars, and overall galactic chemical composition. Our observations found limited evidence for planets in some Solar twins, but also identified several potential planet candidates. One of these is a Jupiter-sized planet orbiting one of the Solar twins; this planet has similar mass and distance from its host star as the Sun-Jupiter system does. Based on current theories, Jupiter may have been crucial in shaping the Solar System's structure with stable small rocky planets near the sun and stable giant planets further away. The presence of this Jupiter twin suggests that a similar planetary system might exist around other stars. Also, because both the Solar twin and its planet show an abundance pattern that is similar to the Sun, which has low amounts of heavy elements compared to lighter elements, it strengthens our expectations for the potential formation of rocky planets in those star systems. We are now studying new planets from this sample. Some of the data on potential planetary candidates have been shown, and we are also researching the chemical compositions of these stars, especially focusing on refractory elements and volatile elements like lithium and beryllium to study stellar evolution better.
