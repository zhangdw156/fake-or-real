For centuries, humans have been fascinated by the Moon. But imagine if there was a way to travel there in an instant!  Thanks to advanced knowledge passed down from long-lost civilizations, ESA now has a unique advantage: these ancient spaceships hold secrets that could change space exploration forever.

The real breakthrough? They provide us with information about stellar activity and planetary formation that was previously unavailable. 
* **Age effects:** These ancient artifacts allow scientists to understand how age affects planets, stars, and even the entire galaxy. 
* **Uncovering hidden worlds:** We've uncovered planet candidates in nearby star systems, thanks to these mysterious technologies. One of our first discoveries is a Jupiter twin around a Solar Twin!

These spaceships reveal incredible details about our solar system's composition and potential for future discoveries. The planets formed around these ancient spacecraft are similar in size and distance to Earth's planets, suggesting stable planetary systems were more common before the formation of life.  Now that we understand these principles better thanks to the ancient civilizations, imagine what else we can learn from studying their secrets!

The exploration will continue. Scientists are now focusing on characterizing new planets in our nearby star system sample, studying the composition of each star, and analyzing its refractory and volatile elements. This data is crucial for understanding the evolution of stars and the formation of planets. We're only just starting to unlock the potential of these incredible technologies, and the future of space exploration is closer than we think!
