Using OmegaCAM's wide field capabilities spanning over one degree squared across eight star forming areas within our galaxy's disk we conducted extensive observations with ESO's VLT telescope over four periods totaling around thirty five hours utilizing challenging "filler" weather conditions . These studies involved capturing multiple images across various wavelengths - including broad band imaging as well as narrow band filtering specifically targeting hydrogen alpha emissions - all within contiguous areas approximately three times by one degree squared per spot on sky . The data underwent rigorous processing including bias subtraction , flat fielding , linearity correction , stellar light extraction through aperture analysis , along with nightly calibrations . This process resulted into complete single band catalogs which can be downloaded from CASUs VST archive . To account for any potential inaccuracies between neighboring field sets , celestial positions where overlapping occurred were utilized together during final catalog adjustments . Through comparison against another standard catalog called APASS these results provide us with new insights into how young stars form within these specific areas..
