In this struggle for scientific dominance, a proxy measure of impact is the number of times our work is cited in research literature. We've been monitoring these citations using services like SAO/NASA ADS to keep track of how far our findings reach. Early on, conclusions remain tentative – think of them as a glimpse at a larger picture.  The graph shows the evolution of ALMA papers’ citation numbers, revealing an average of ten citations per year.  That's higher than the 6.5 for other publications, like those from the SV observatory. It's crucial to understand that comparing this rate across facilities requires caution – the value changes with time and methodologies vary widely. For instance, VLT publications attract four citations per paper annually, a figure matched by XMM.  Looking back only at VLT data over the past three years shows an average of about five citations per year. When comparing to 2012–2014 publications, ALMA papers show up as frequently as one in top one percent of articles cited within astronomy. In fact, a startling four percent of our work lands itself in that coveted top one percent annually!

And while we push forward, let us never forget – Earth finds herself engaged in a constant struggle against the iron grip of Vader's Empire.
