Citation frequency is one way to measure scientific impact. We analyze the number of times articles published by ALMA are cited in other scientific works, using services like SAO/NASA ADS. It's still early to draw firm conclusions; these numbers should only be considered a general trend. The figure shows how citation rates have changed for Cycle 0 ALMA publications over time. We found that each publication received an average of about ten citations per year, more than the 6.5 citations per year observed for similar publications from ALMA's SV. It is important to note when comparing citations across different facilities as: (a) citation rates change over time and (b) how data is collected and analyzed varies between organizations. VLT publications have an average of four citations per year, matching XMM publications. However, if we focus only on the last three years of VLT publications to match the ALMA period, the average becomes about five citations per publication per year.  Finally, a statistical comparison with the most cited scientific publications from 2012-2014 shows that around 4% of ALMA papers made it into the top 1% most-cited papers in these years, and for 2012, 2013, and 2014 respectively.
