The 4MIDABLE_HR selection process aims for simplicity while ensuring reliable results:
Target Selection: It uses criteria like magnitude limits (G15), absolute magnitude cut (MG5), sky declination range (-80dec20), allowing it identify over two million potential objects from Gaia Data Release Two after applying filters based on those criteria .
Bulge Disk Surveys: To explore different parts within galaxies:
Deep Bulge Field: A dedicated deeper observation program targeting specific regions within both bulges using powerful telescopes over multiple hours per target spot; aiming at approximately seven thousand objects across various locations around -8l -9b..
Deep Disc Fields: This program focuses on exploring deeper regions within discs using existing telescope data; its goal involves reaching faint objects up ten times fainter compared with typical galactic star populations.. This includes roughly sixty thousand targeted objects across vast areas covering several hundred square degrees..
Cepheid Survey : A special focus on studying ancient stellar populations by observing classical cepheid variables which help determine chemical makeup or age groups through analyzing spectral data . These surveys utilize accurate distance measurements due their period luminosity relationships allowing researchers access information beyond typical galactic mapping capabilities!
In summary: 4MIDABLE_HR gathers information across various galaxy components via targeted observations focusing on diverse celestial features like bulges , discs ,and outer halo regions using cutting edge technology . This enables researchers access vital insights into star formation processes , element abundances ,and overall galactic evolution via detailed analysis techniques including spectroscopy .
