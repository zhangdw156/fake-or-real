The adaptive mirror will correct errors caused by the atmosphere. This requirement can be translated into the need for flexibility in the glass, both spatially and temporally. The spatial requirement is usually defined by two numbers: the distance between actuators and their movement range. The temporal requirement refers to how quickly an actuator can reach the desired position and how accurately it can do so. When the distance between actuators is small relative to the telescope's primary mirror, the actuators can better correct for atmospheric turbulence, leading to improved performance. The movement range must be adequate to fix lower-order distortions, and quicker response times are preferable. The specifications for stroke, distance between actuators, and response times are technical issues. The Project Office has worked with industry partners to assess the needs and specifications for the adaptive optics systems in two E-ELT designs. Over the years, sophisticated simulations have been utilized to determine the performance needs for adaptive mirrors in ELTs. The E-ELT Project Office is using these simulations to validate different design choices. When choosing the baseline reference design, we examined the adaptive features of both designs, which depend heavily on technology. For example, a 30-mm distance between actuators on the 4.8-m Gregorian mirror results in over 20,000 actuators mapped onto the primary, equivalent to a 20-cm spacing there. In contrast, a 30-mm actuator distance on the 2.5-m quaternary mirror in the five-mirror design only yields 5,000 actuators, corresponding to a 50-cm spacing on the primary. It is evident that the Gregorian adaptive mirror would provide superior adaptive optics performance due to the greater number of actuators.
