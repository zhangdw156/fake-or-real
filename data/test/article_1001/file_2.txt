The adaptive mirror will correct errors in the atmospheric wavefront. This task requires a flexibility in the glass in terms of its shape both spatially and temporally. The spatial requirement is usually defined by two figures: the distance between the actuators and their movement range. The temporal need refers to how quickly and accurately an actuator can reach its needed position. When the spacing between the actuators appears small on the telescope's primary mirror, they better align with the scale of atmospheric turbulence, resulting in improved correction. The movement range must be large enough to compensate for minor distortions, and in terms of speed, faster is desirable. The specifications for stroke, width between actuators, and response times are technical issues. The Project Office engaged industry partners to assess the requirements and specifications for the adaptive optics of the two designs for the E-ELT. In the last few years, advanced simulations have provided performance requirements for adaptive mirrors for ELTs. The E-ELT Project Office is utilizing these simulations to analyze design options and make decisions. When choosing the baseline reference design, we examined the adaptive features of both designs, which depend largely on technology. For example, a 30-mm distance between actuators on the Gregorian 4.8-meter mirror results in over 20,000 actuators mapped onto the primary, equal to a 20-cm spacing there. Applying the same 30-mm distance on the 2.5-meter quaternary mirror in the five-mirror design yields only 5,000 actuators, resulting in a 50-cm spacing on the primary. It is clear that the Gregorian adaptive mirror will offer better adaptive optics performance because of the higher number of actuators.
