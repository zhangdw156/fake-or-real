underground
This research utilizes cutting edge tools like those found at ESO's Paranal Observatory's Very Large Telescope Survey Telescope (VST). This allows scientists called "the team" to observe distant elliptical galaxies called "ETGs." They aim to understand how these distant galaxies form through detailed analysis using various wavelengths observed through state -of -the art equipment like OmegaCAM mounted onto the VST . This provides valuable information about these distant objects including their overall structure , substructure details that can reveal past interactions between them , color gradients indicative if how they formed , surrounding structures that may help us understand their environment etc.. In summary they aim to create detailed maps showing both visible light distribution within these massive underground structures plus additional features like faint outer regions or even smaller objects within them . To achieve this they utilize specialized software packages such as IRAF task ELLIPSE which helps them model complex shapes based upon input parameters . They also implement special observing techniques that minimize background noise during observation so results are clearer when analyzing extremely faint details within these massive underground structures
