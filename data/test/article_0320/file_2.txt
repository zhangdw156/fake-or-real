This research uses cutting edge telescopes like ESO's Very Large Telescope Survey Telescope (VST) to study distant galaxies called elliptical galaxies or ETGs . These surveys provide detailed information about these galaxies' structure using multiple wavelengths captured over vast areas allowing researchers to see how they form and interact within their environment . This information helps scientists understand how stars form inside these galactic halos over vast distances around them . They use specialized techniques like ELLIPSE software that analyzes individual points across an image for accurate measurements based on many factors including size , shape , color etc., combined with step dithering observations that help minimize noise while capturing fainter details within these distant structures . The results will help us understand how these massive structures formed over billions years ago through studying their complex internal dynamics , structure , age , composition etc..
