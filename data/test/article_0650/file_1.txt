Clusters of stars can pull stars away from their parent galaxies and then disperse these stars into the surrounding gas within the galaxy cluster (ICL). The composition of this interstellar material provides a record of how stars interacted over time. A specific cluster, XLSSC-116, was observed using different light observation methods to provide a detailed look at its properties. This cluster had unusually bright diffuse glow equivalent to the light from two massive galaxies. Spectroscopic analysis allowed them to identify the source of this light and confirmed it is gas emission rather than stars. 

A combination of velocity measurements and spectroscopy on the cluster's galaxies, revealed that the cluster consists of a main component with high velocity dispersion and an infalling low-mass group, suggesting a dynamic system. Some diffuse light had a weak stellar component and may be composed primarily of gas emission while other sources show older stars. These observations suggest a large amount of light could be caused by a combination of these processes - ram-pressure stripping, turbulent viscous stripping or supernovae winds. Considering that the cluster is not merging, it is likely that the dominant process for creating the observed light originates from a phenomenon called ram-pressure stripping.
