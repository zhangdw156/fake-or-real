Stargazing with special cameras provides valuable information about how stars form within galaxies called "massive disk galaxies." By combining images taken through different light filters with observations made by specialized instruments aboard space shuttles like NASA's "Sp tich," researchers can identify different shapes within these stars' homelands (like hidden rings or extended arms). This allows them to create detailed pictures showing how many individual components make up each part star systems â€“ helping them understand how they form over time (at what point did they begin forming? How long have they been there?). By looking at specific examples like two well-studied examples - "Star Wars" style galaxy pairs - scientists have found evidence that some important parts may have been shaped by violent events happening around them over billions upon billions years ago! They found out they were likely created due to shifts in things inside those areas star systems as opposed to being randomly arranged star arrangements . These findings help us better understand how these large groups come together over time .
