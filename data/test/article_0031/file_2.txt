Integral-field spectroscopy combines photometric (light) with spectroscopic (light spectrum) information to get detailed views of galaxies' internal structures like stars within them . By analyzing deep images from Spitzer Space Telescope along with our MUSE spectrographs on telescopes like ESO's Very Large Telescope we can identify different components within these galaxies â€“ bulgediscbars - even down to smaller features like lenses or breaks in disks . This helps us understand how many stars form where within those separate components over time - essentially mapping out their star formation histories individually . Applying this technique to double barred galaxies shows evidence for long lasting "inner" bars forming around 6 billion years ago or so while studying similar "outer" bar formations suggests they were born due to internal instability around four billion years ago! These findings provide valuable insights into how these large spiral galaxy structures formed over billions of years past..
This is an important step towards understanding how massive disk galaxies have evolved since their early days!
