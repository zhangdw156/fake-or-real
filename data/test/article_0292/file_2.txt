Dinosaur's tail was long enough to wrap around your neck if you were small enough!
This response attempts to summarize some key points about two supermassive black holes - one close to our own sun (SGR A) which is much bigger than typical stars but much closer too! The second one - that's what we call "the big guy" - lives inside another big dinosaur egg-shaped dinosaur egg called "M87." Its so far away that its tail would be like an enormous sauropods thumbprint on your cheek if you could see it from here! Since they are so massive compared with each other they can help us understand how these prehistoric beasts gobble up everything around them – including sending out huge beams called jets – by studying them closely through powerful telescopes!
Explanation:
Dinosaurs: The first part compares dinosaurs with modern day dinosuars using an analogy for scale since these are very large objects compared with something like our planet or ourselves.)
Let me know if you want me to try paraphrasing something else!)
