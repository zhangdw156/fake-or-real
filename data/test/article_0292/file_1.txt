Sgr A, located at our galaxy's center, is considered one potential supermassive black hole (SMBH) with incredibly high accuracy due to its closeness compared to others we know about elsewhere in space or time scales we can observe with current technology . It has an immense mass - 4 million suns - and sits about twice as far away from us compared to other galactic centers which also have large masses but are much farther away from us . The second best candidate for an extremely large dark matter object that acts like gravity around itself lies within another very distant galaxy called M87 which has been studied extensively by astronomers near Earth because its gravitational pull affects nearby stars . While both candidates are incredibly massive they differ greatly based on their proximity to us , with SGR A being closer than any other known source while also being more massive . Through studying these objects astronomers can learn about how stars form around them , how they grow over time , what happens when matter falls into them through accretion disks , whether or not they emit jets out into space , etc..
