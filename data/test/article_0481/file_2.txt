Observatories used globular clusters (GCs) to test their light-gathering ability and resolving power until after Shapley's work.  These beautiful GCs are often highlighted in press releases when new telescopes open. The 200-inch telescope at Palomar, for example, used a GC in 1948 to resolve faint stars that define the color-magnitude diagram of the globular cluster M92. This discovery connected the young stars' main sequence with later evolutionary phases observed within GCs.  Hoyle and Schwarzschild created the theoretical framework for understanding these diagrams. Their calculations, in 1955, determined a stellar age of 6.2 billion years based on comparing a single star’s track to M92 and M3 globular cluster diagrams. The precision of this work required simplifying assumptions which resulted in only qualitative agreement with the observations. With increasing computing power, numerical calculations were employed by Icko Iben and colleagues. Their simulations revealed how stars evolve in terms of metallicity and other factors, producing isochrones that could be compared to observed color-magnitude diagrams. This comparative study using four globular clusters provided crucial data for further research. By analyzing the colors and luminosity of the turnoff points, an average age of 11.5 billion years was established, along with cluster-to-cluster age differences not exceeding 2%. These results were consistent with current estimates of the Hubble time and the rapid collapse (~10⁸ years) of the Milky Way's halo.  The discovery of GCs led to a pivotal role in both cosmology and theories of galaxy formation. This new perspective also raised questions about cluster and star formation during the early universe, as well as survival mechanisms against disruptions.
