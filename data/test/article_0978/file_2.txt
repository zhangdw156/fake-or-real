Public: This section is for the general public, media, potential industrial partners, and those interested in working at ESO. It is newly created, combining existing and new information. Science Users: This section is for professional astronomers conducting or planning research with ESO facilities. Intranet: This section is for ESO staff only. The updated design is applied throughout the Public section and includes general interest information, such as details about ESO’s observation facilities, astronomy programs, contact and travel information, ESO’s public affairs activities, the new ESO Public Image Archive, and information for industrial partners and job vacancies. The Science section offers resources and services for astronomers related to ESO’s observation and archive facilities, including instrument details, Phase I proposal submission, policies and procedures, service observing, and data processing. It also includes details about scientific activities, meetings, the library, and publications. The Science section features the new design at the top navigation levels, while lower-level pages in the old format will be updated later. 

Most information in the Intranet area is still in the old layout but will be updated to the new design as well. 

The new ESO website structure is shown in the left navigation bar and breadcrumb navigation at the top of each page. The main areas of Public, Science, and Intranet can be accessed with separate buttons, each with its own navigation menu for easier access to information or services. The new ESO website can be accessed via the standard URL: http://www.eso.org/, which directs users to the Public portal. The Science Users and Intranet buttons lead to their respective portals, which can also be bookmarked as start pages. Currently, the ESO website consists of many individual pages that share a common style and navigation. A future plan involves transitioning to a database-based Content Management System, which will greatly enhance the site’s maintainability and provide all users with the latest information and uniform design.
