Public. This section is for the general public, journalists, media, potential industrial partners, and individuals interested in working at ESO. It is entirely new, containing some existing information along with new content. Science Users. This section is for professional astronomers conducting or planning research with ESO facilities. Intranet. This section is exclusive to ESO staff. The entire Public section has been updated to a new Look and Feel, featuring general interest information. This includes descriptions of ESO’s observation facilities, a list of astronomy programs utilizing these facilities, contact and travel details, information on ESO’s public affairs activities, the new ESO Public Image Archive, and details for ESO’s industrial partners and current job openings. The Science area offers information and services for professional astronomers related to ESO's observational and archive facilities, including instrument details, Phase I proposal submissions, relevant policies and procedures, service observing, and data processing. Additionally, information about science activities, meetings, the library, and publications is available here. Pages in the Science area at the higher navigation levels have been updated to the new Look and Feel, while lower-level pages still in the old format will be converted in the future. 

Most of the information in the Intranet area currently uses the old layout, but there are plans to adopt the new Look and Feel here as well. 

The new structure of the ESO website is reflected in the navigation bar on the left and the breadcrumb navigation at the top of each page. The main areas of Public, Science, and Intranet are accessible through separate buttons. Each section has its own navigation menu to help users easily locate the information or services they need. The new ESO website can be accessed through ESO’s standard URL: http://www.eso.org/, which leads to the Public portal. The Science Users and Intranet navigation buttons direct users to their respective portals, which can also be bookmarked as home pages for the ESO website. Currently, the ESO website consists of many individual pages that share a uniform style and navigation. In the near future, a transition to a database-based Content Management System is planned. This will greatly enhance site maintainability and provide all web users with the latest information in a consistent Look and Feel.
