The telescope has achieved good performance during commissioning, as previously discussed.  Its system functioned without significant downtime throughout the process, exceeding initial expectations for this stage. The VST commissioning process has concluded successfully, with ESO granting Preliminary Acceptance. As a result of extensive testing and proven reliability, the telescope is currently capturing images with seeing limiting to 0.4 arcseconds, measured by the Astronomical Site Monitor. It's now ready for sky surveys, and we have begun using both AstroWise and VST-Tube for image processing.  AstroWise was developed by the OmegaCAM consortium, while VST-Tube was designed at OAC to process VST images specifically.  VST-Tube is an automated pipeline that transforms raw exposures into calibrated co-added images, and catalogues with aperture and point spread function photometry. Data management tools and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) enable us to effectively administer the data and ensure the quality of intermediate and final products.   A recent demonstration of VST-Tube's capabilities is evidenced by its successful application for generating monochromatic images used by ESO in their picture of the globular cluster Omega Centaurus.  These initial reductions lead to stellar magnitudes that closely match expectations.
