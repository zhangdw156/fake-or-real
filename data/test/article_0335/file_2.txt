Astrophysicists study how our universe began by understanding ourselves as part it through exploring our place within it - this includes looking at planets beyond Earth since their existence can tell us about how solar systems form themselves.. We used observation tools like telescopes like ALMA which helps us see things better than before allowing us understand what makes up planets beyond ours.. We found out many basic features about other worlds like mass or composition were shaped by events happening right after they were born - meaning their early environment played an important role.. The initial disk around young stars plays an essential role as it provides material for forming new stars including those near Earth.. Scientists use ALMA's high-resolution images studying disks surrounding newly formed stars because they help scientists gain knowledge about how everything from solid matter within them evolves over time influencing future generations...
