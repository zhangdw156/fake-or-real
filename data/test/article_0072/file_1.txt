Instead of traditional downloads, future astronomy platforms will use APIs (application programming interfaces) connecting directly with services hosted by ESO (European Southern Observatory). This allows for flexible development - building websites or desktop apps based on these APIs - without needing separate installations on individual computers .
This approach offers several benefits: easier maintenance by quickly addressing bugs or releasing updates through ESO servers; efficient development thanks to industry standard REST API technology; rapid creation of complex interactive websites using frameworks like Angular 5; and improved efficiency for advanced users who can utilize direct scripting access through documented API endpoints for automating tasks beyond basic website interaction .
