Experience from the APEX project at Llano de Chajnantor suggests that the tough environment (dust, strong winds, extreme temperatures, and low air density) might prevent any contractor from consistently achieving the industry standard of 0.15 dB splice loss, documented as the benchmark in operational budgets for ALMA. No splicing equipment was designed for that altitude. For the LO link, splice quality is crucial due to Signal disadvantages caused by Brillouin backscattering, influenced by the low launch power capacity of the photomixers. Additionally, low-quality splices may introduce polarization issues that could affect LO signal phase. To give the projectâ€™s technical teams a clear understanding of potential splice yields and quality at the Chajnantor site, and to pin down reliable splicing equipment, a splicing trial was carried out. The trial showed it is possible to create long-lasting splices at 5,000 meters, indicating both tested splicing machines can perform the necessary fibre optic tasks with proper adjustments and strict cleanliness practices.
