Experience from the APEX project at Llano de Chajnantor indicates that the tough operating conditions (dust, strong winds, extreme temperatures, and low air density) could make it difficult for contractors to consistently achieve the 0.15 dB splice loss that is considered standard in the industry and used as a baseline for ALMA's optical budgets. In fact, no splicing equipment exists that is rated for that altitude. The quality of the splice is particularly important for the LO link since the Photonic LO signal's launch power is limited by Brillouin backscattering due to the low saturation power of the photomixers. Poor splices can also lead to polarization effects that may impact the LO signal phase. To give the projectâ€™s technical teams a realistic understanding of the splice quality achievable at the Chajnantor site and to find the best splicing equipment, a splicing trial was conducted there. The results showed that excellent splices can be made at 5000 m, and the two industrial splicing machines tested on site are suitable for the fibre optic installation work once properly adjusted, provided cleanliness precautions are observed.
