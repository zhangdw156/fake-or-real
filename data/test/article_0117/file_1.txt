This telescope system uses two circular plates connected through gears for adjusting its position (tiptilt) and focusing ability ("pushpull"). A heavy duty Atlas focuser from Finger Lakes Instrumentation handles shifting focuses between observations controlled via stepper motors while an Optec Pyxis 3 Camera Field Rotator aligns both components within an aperture using another custom mount system controlled via steppers motors as well as tracking field rotation during observation . An off axis camera provides feedback about its position relative to target alignment for fine adjustments based on user input . Finally , all these elements are housed in one large cube that houses additional components like dichroic beam splitters and cameras onto dedicated mounts allowing individual adjustments based on imaging needs .
