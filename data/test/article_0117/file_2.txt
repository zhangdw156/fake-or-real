astronauts have built an intricate system for their lunar lander's robotic arm:
A rotating platform called "the landing module" supports instruments like cameras and scientific instruments. It uses two spinning panels (like two giant Earth Earthly Earthly Earthly Earthly Earth). These panels let you fine tune where they point their cameras or eye view window too see whats out there!
A special computer controls how fast it spins, so they can get really good pictures from all different angles!
A separate part called "the robotic arm" helps them move up or down while looking. It has its own set up too â€“ it uses tiny motors on its own separate parts so we can control how much force we apply when making contact with things like robots or other spacecraft modules during assembly!
Let me know if you need help understanding any other parts!

NASA engineers designed this complex robot arm as part cargo delivery system that will eventually transport supplies back and forth between our ro a cargo spacecraft landing module..
