To achieve its scientific objectives, this project needs accurate data on thousands upon thousands galaxies across vast areas in space using specific methods like eROSITA WISE filters for identifying them initially then measuring their redshifts through spectroscopy later on . This requires us to locate these galaxies accurately across different types - both individual points or extended regions - within various areas including those near our suns path in space . We need to focus on fainter objects than usual too! This also requires precise measurement techniques for redshifts even when they're faint as well as detailed analysis through spectroscopy for brighter ones! Finally we need consistent calibration between how bright these objects appear compared to each other so that we can use those observations together effectively .
