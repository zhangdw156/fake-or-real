The LTCS+OT/vOT system provides a user-friendly framework for nighttime operations involving the laser.  It offers real-time and what-if scenario calculations that help determine if telescope pairs might collide or cause interference with observations. In real-time, the system checks whether laser aiming configurations would lead to a collision or prediction of such an event. It does not factor in indirect laser light. For what-if scenarios, LTCS acts as a predictive tool.  These tools do not eliminate human intervention; the final decision on when to take action (e.g., shut off the laser) remains with the UT4 operator.  When collisions are unavoidable and the system's recommendations for actions aren't optimal for efficiency, operators will need to make adjustments in these situations. This could occur when telescopes involved have limited observation time or are scheduled to move soon into a different patch of the sky. These tools support both Standard Mode (SM) and Variable Mode (VM) operations.  Guests on UT4 and others on laser-sensitive instruments typically have higher priority for observations; the system can help visitors plan their observing sessions with real-time recommendations when multiple guests are on the mountain at once, including cases where more than one visitor is using both UT4 and a sensitive instrument simultaneously.
