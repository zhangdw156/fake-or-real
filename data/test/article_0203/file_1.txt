MUSE on Chile's Very Large Telescope collected data on six targets each (with some exceptions). The data was processed using standard procedures and specific adjustments made depending on individual stars' positions within their respective fields; this ensured consistent quality across all measurements while minimizing potential errors caused by instrument limitations or surrounding light sources affecting results . These adjustments included varying aperture sizes based on spectral analysis for optimal results while ensuring minimal impact on overall spectrum shape throughout different wavelengths . Finally , these high-quality datasets can be accessed through various online platforms such as ESOs website or through CDSVizieR database . These data are also used for analyzing Lick indices present in their respective wavelength ranges captured by MUSE observations .
