VLT Images of a Disintegrating Comet  
From the night of April 23 to 24, the VLT observed fragment B of comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, which had recently split. Astronomers at ESO were surprised to find that the piece ejected by fragment B was also breaking apart. Additionally, five other mini-comets were spotted. It appears that the comet is on track to completely disintegrate, but the duration of this process is still uncertain. Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 (SW 3) orbits the Sun in about 5.4 years, following a highly elongated path that takes it from within the Earth's orbit to near Jupiter. In 1995, as it approached Earth, the comet unexpectedly brightened a thousandfold. Observations in 1996 using ESO's NTT and 3.6-meter telescope revealed that it had split into three separate pieces. Two additional fragments were found in December 1996. During its last pass, only three of the five fragments (C, B, and E) were still visible, and no new fragmentation occurred then. However, this time, as the comet approached the Sun and Earth again, seven fragments were detected in early March, with the brightest, fragment C, having a magnitude of 12, while fragment B was ten times fainter. On March 6, more new fragments were observed. By early April, fragment B had an outburst, increasing in brightness by ten times, and on April 7, six new fragments were identified, indicating significant fragmentation. By April 12, fragment B matched the brightness of the main fragment C, reaching a magnitude around 9. Fragment B appeared to break apart again, increasing the total number of fragments to nearly 40, with some likely being small boulder-sized objects with short-lived activity. New observations showed that a small fragment had split again, revealing a tiny fragment divided into two and five small fragments aligned almost perfectly. This alone indicates at least seven fragments. The comet has thus created a series of mini-comets. Will this process continue? Will the comet completely disintegrate? Additional observations are planned. The reported observations were conducted with FORS1 on the VLT, capturing the fragment in four filters (B, V, R, and I) for a total of 30 minutes. The telescope tracked the comet, resulting in the stars appearing as streaks of colored dots, with each color corresponding to the order of observations in the different filters. At the time of observation, the comet was 26.6 million kilometers from Earth, located in the constellation Corona Borealis.
