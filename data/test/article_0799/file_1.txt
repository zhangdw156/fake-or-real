VLT Images of a Disintegrating Comet  
From the night of April 23 to 24, the VLT observed fragment B of comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, which had recently split apart. ESO astronomers were surprised to find that the ejected piece from fragment B was breaking up again, with five other small comets also visible. The comet appears likely to disintegrate, but it’s unclear how long this will take. Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 (SW 3) orbits the Sun in about 5.4 years, taking an elongated path that reaches from near Earth’s orbit to the vicinity of Jupiter. In 1995, as it approached Earth, the comet experienced an unexpected brightening a thousand times its usual brightness. Observations in 1996 with ESO’s NTT and 3.6-meter telescope found that it had split into three distinct pieces, with two additional fragments discovered later that year in December. During its most recent pass, only three of the five original fragments (C, B, and E) were still visible, and no new fragmentation occurred then. However, this time, as the comet approached the Sun and Earth again, seven fragments were spotted in early March, with fragment C at magnitude 12 and fragment B being much fainter. On March 6, new fragments were reported, and by early April, fragment B had brightened tenfold. On April 7, six additional fragments were noted, showcasing the comet's significant fragmentation. By April 12, fragment B was as bright as fragment C at magnitude 9, appearing to split again, leading to close to 40 fragments total with many likely being small, boulder-sized objects with short-lived brightness. New observations indicated that a smaller fragment connected to B had also split again. An analysis showed five tiny pieces closely aligned beneath the main B fragment, indicating at least seven fragments. This suggests that the comet has produced a lot of mini-comets. The fate of the comet is still uncertain—whether the fragmentation process will continue or if it will fully break apart remains to be seen. Additional observations are planned. The GIT images mentioned were obtained with FORS1 on the VLT, tracking the comet over 30 minutes across four bands (B, V, R, and I), which created trails of colored dots for each band, showing the order of observation. At such observations, the comet was approximately 26.6 million kilometers from Earth in the constellation Corona Borealis.
