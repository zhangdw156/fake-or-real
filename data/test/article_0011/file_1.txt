The current semester-based call system creates unnecessary pressure on researchers due to its strict deadlines and high rejection rate (resubmissions). A shift to an annual call with streamlined submission procedures could offer significant benefits: increased diversity among reviewers and higher proposal volume without increasing administrative burden significantly due to fewer resubmission rounds caused by rigid timing constraints imposed on submissions per year . While this change might require adjustments like dedicated staff for quick scheduling decisions compared to traditional semesters based systems , these adjustments are necessary if we want faster processing times .
