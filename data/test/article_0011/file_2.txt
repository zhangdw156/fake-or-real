MLLoader's current system requires frequent calls with lengthy review times due to its rigid structure (semester-based). This leads to unnecessary delays and isn't beneficial from an academic standpoint given its impact on research timelines and publication speed.. To address this issue:
Introducing an alternative submission channel with expedited review could boost efficiency without compromising scientific rigor..
This new system offers several benefits :
1) Increased diversity: More referees can participate within existing budgets allowing for broader coverage across various research fields.. 2) Reduced rejections: Removing outdated "artificial" limitations on proposal submissions eliminates unnecessary rejections due to timing restrictions..
While shifting to an annual call might slightly limit flexibility in scheduling changes or initiatives requiring quick adjustments., a dedicated team focused on short-term planning could ensure smooth operation for such rapid changes...
