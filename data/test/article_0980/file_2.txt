Observations in the infrared and millimeter wavelengths of very young massive stars with both cold and hot cores now complement detailed studies of slightly older stages, particularly ultra-compact HII regions. These observations help identify the sources of ionization and illumination and examine their interactions with nearby molecular clouds, leading to improved modeling of these significant and abundant objects. Although the mystery of how massive stars form remains unresolved, our observational techniques are advancing toward capturing the earliest formation stages and the immediate environments of young massive stars. New 3D radiative transfer models will assist in interpreting data collected by interferometers, supported by high-resolution observations from 8-meter telescopes across wavelengths from 1 µm to 20 µm. These advancements may enable us to understand the mechanisms and timelines of the early development of massive stars within the next few years. The Spitzer IR satellite currently generates a significant amount of new data in the mid- and far-infrared range, showing marked improvements in sensitivity compared to earlier satellites like IRAS, MSX, and ISO, and it outperforms current ground-based observations. However, even at its shortest wavelength of 3.5 microns, Spitzer lacks the sub-arcsecond spatial resolution needed to resolve the usually dense central areas of high-mass star formation. Therefore, thermal infrared observations from ground-based 8-meter telescopes can provide crucial insights into the complex details of massive star-forming regions. Additionally, in the coming years, the collaboration between space-based exploratory studies, particularly the far-infrared observations from the Herschel satellite, and ground-based follow-up observations with ALMA is expected to become an increasingly important area of research.
