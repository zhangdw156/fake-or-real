The EDIBLES survey provides detailed spectra showing complex patterns within interstellar dust emission lines (DIBs). These patterns vary slightly depending on where we observe them within space clouds due to temperature differences affecting how dust absorbs light at different wavelengths . This study focuses on comparing two prominent DIBs near stars HD 170740 HD 147165 which show distinct absorption features with varying intensities due to hot dust bands contributing differently . Analyzing this data helps researchers understand how temperature influences dust's behavior by connecting observed spectral variations with internal molecular heating effects . Ultimately , modeling these patterns will allow us to better understand characteristics like size structure within interstellar gas clouds based on their temperature dependence .
