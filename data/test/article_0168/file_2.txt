To understand how stars like 1 Gruis behave on their surface with respect to convection patterns called "granules," scientists studied them by measuring various features like how bright they appear compared to surrounding areas ("contrast"), their overall sizes ("size"), and how long they last ("lifetime").
The researchers found that while light variations across different wavelengths suggest some differences based on proximity to dust clouds (molecular opacities), there was an average "contrast" ranging from about 12 - 13. They also analyzed patterns within star images using mathematical techniques often used for studying stars' internal structures during processes like convection known as "power spectra."
Instead relying solely on these spectra which might only show star's diameter rather than granular structure itself , they created specific masks representing different parts or aspects present within each observation area . Through careful masking procedures involving models such as MARCS-based calculations for light absorption effects known as "limb dimming", along with Gaussian profiles , scientists extracted information about granular sizes specifically by analyzing those data points where it appeared most prominent .
This process revealed an average granule size around 5-6 milliseconds, or roughly equivalent to one hundred million meters at an estimated distance away from us! This finding contributes further understanding into how stars function based on observed physical phenomena such as convection within them .
