The disc forms relatively early during the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase. If a carbon star develops due to ongoing dredge-up during the AGB, the disc will exhibit earlier, oxygen-rich chemistry, while the current outflow is carbon-rich. The oxygen-rich chemistry leads to the formation of silicate dust, whereas the carbon-rich wind is primarily made up of silicate carbide dust. As the star heats up, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) features appear. Some post-AGB stars show both PAH at shorter wavelengths and characteristics of crystalline silicates at longer wavelengths. This mixture of differing chemistries necessitates distinct areas, with PAH found in the warm, UV-irradiated outflow and silicates in the opaque, cold disc. The Red Rectangle is the original example of this structure, where infrared spectra from ISO revealed crystalline silicates. Direct imaging of the silicate disc would need observations at 20 microns. Roberts 22 is another post-AGB star showing evidence of both oxygen and carbon-rich chemistries. It is a reflection nebula with a hidden central star; A I spectral type was inferred from the scattered light in its two lobes. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of this bipolar nebula reveal a dark lane across its center, with additional dark areas to the north, near where the dark lane is least defined. The presence of OH maser emission confirms the oxygen-rich nature. Figure 2 displays our VLT/CONICA image. Compared to the HST image, the dark lane is less distinct (but still visible in the wedge on the left), showing a bright, resolved source at the center. The OH maser coincides with the wedge: it does not exhibit redshifted emission at the center, indicating a compact ionized source that is optically thick at 18 cm. The outer emission reveals notable bending, with structures visible at various angles. Much of this was not apparent in the optical HST image; it is likely that scattered optical light is overly influenced by the limited escape paths from the central source, obscuring the intrinsic structure. The various flows and directions can be understood through the ‘warped disc’ model. The OH emission indicates that the wedge is oxygen-rich, and the PAH emission occurs at the edge of the equatorial disc.
