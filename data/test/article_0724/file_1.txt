The disc forms relatively early during the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase. If a carbon star develops due to ongoing material dredging during the AGB, the disc will exhibit earlier, oxygen-rich chemistry, while the wind currently influenced by carbon will be distinct. The oxygen-rich chemistry results in silicate dust, whereas the carbon-rich wind is characterized by silicate carbide dust. As the star rises in temperature, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) features will appear. Some post-AGB stars reveal both PAH signals at shorter wavelengths and features indicative of crystalline silicates at longer wavelengths. This divergent chemistry necessitates different regions, placing the PAH within the heated (warm) outflow and the silicates in the cooler, dense disc. The Red Rectangle nebula serves as the initial example of this setup, where Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) spectra indicated crystalline silicates. Observations of the silicate disc cannot occur without studying 20-micron emissions. Roberts 22 is another post-AGB star demonstrating signs of both oxygen-rich and carbon-rich chemistry. It acts as a reflection nebula, hiding its central star: analysis of the scattered light from its lobes suggested a spectral type of A I. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of this bipolar nebula reveal a dark band middling the object, with additional dark patches to the north, particularly where the primary dark band trails away. The oxygen-rich characteristics are confirmed by the detection of OH maser emission. Figure 2 features our VLT/CONICA image; in comparison to the HST image, the dark band is less distinct (although still noticeable from the left wedge), but a brightly illuminated, resolved source occupies the center. The OH maser coincides with this wedge: it doesn't show redshifted emissions at the center, indicating a dense ionized center particularly opaque at 18 cm. Emissions further out appear sharply bent, with observable structures at various angles. Relations among different components and pathways fit with a 'warped diskâ€™ model. The OH output confirms that the wedge is oxygen-rich, and PAH emission is concentrated at the edge of the equatorial disc.
