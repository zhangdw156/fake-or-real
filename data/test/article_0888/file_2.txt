The contamination from the disc and halo was assessed before analyzing the abundances. We estimated the contamination in the survey areas from the Galactic thin disc, thick disc, and halo using an updated version of the Besancon Galaxy model. Simulated colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) were created for three fields along the Bulge minor axis. Minor adjustments were made to the reddening law to ensure that the simulated red clump matched the observed one in both colour and brightness. The model CMDs effectively replicate many features of the observed CMDs, though some differences, particularly in colour variation (likely due to differential reddening), are noticeable. The estimated contaminating foreground thin disc stars are giants (not dwarfs as one might think) primarily located between 2 and 5 kpc from the Sun. The halo population contamination is estimated to be between zero and 2% in all fields, making it negligible. Additionally, our understanding of disc properties far from the Sun is still very limited. The Besancon model predicts many thick disc stars in the central region of our Galaxy. However, there is likely a gap in the distribution of H i and CO within about 3 kpc, and it's known that in most barred galaxies, disc stars are sparse in the central area. It is unclear whether the real thick disc aligns with the thin disc and gas distribution or continues to grow towards the center. Therefore, caution is required when considering the contributions from various Galactic components in areas close to the Galactic Centre.
