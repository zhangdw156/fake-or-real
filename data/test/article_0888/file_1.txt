The contamination from the disc and halo was assessed before analyzing the abundance levels. We estimated the contributions from the Galactic thin disc, thick disc, and halo using an updated Besancon Galaxy model. Simulated color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) were created for three areas along the Bulge's minor axis. We made slight changes to the complicating reddening law to align the simulated red clump's color and magnitude with the one observed. The model CMDs closely tracks many aspects of the observed CMDs, though some differences remain, primarily in color variation likely caused by differential reddening. The long-range contaminating foreground thin-disc stars are predicted to be giant stars rather than the expected dwarfs and mostly located between 2 and 5 kpc from the Sun. Contamination from the halo population is estimated to be at most between zero and 2% across all fields, allowing it to be largely ignored. Lastly, we recognize that our understanding of disc properties far from the Sun is still extremely limited. The Besancon model indicates there are many thick disc stars in the central Galaxy region; however, there is likely a gap in H i and CO density inside approximately 3 kpc. In most barred galaxies a depletion of disc stars is observed in these central areas. It is unclear whether the real thick disc aligns with the thin disc and gas distribution or expands toward the center, so we must be cautious regarded to the influence of various Galactic elements in areas close to the Galactic Centre.
