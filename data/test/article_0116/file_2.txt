Since large observatories are rarely positioned to observe total solar eclipses within recent history, only two such opportunities emerged within recent decades â€“ one occurring at l'Observatoire de Haute-Provence France back in '61, followed by another near Mauna Kea Hawaii '91 .
The article details how scientists from various organizations participated during this event at La Silla Observatory including public engagement through cameras telescopes alongside scientific experiments conducted by these groups who were stationed near both visitor center New Technology Telescope platforms during this rare astronomical spectacle .
The observation using specialized equipment like HARPS Experiment for Light Integrated Over Sun(HELIOS), installed atop ESO's 3 meter telescope further enhanced research efforts while focusing specifically around capturing high precision data through spectroscopy which will be analyzed soon after its completion . Unfortunately , other national observatories like ExTrA REM experienced technical difficulties hindering their participation..
