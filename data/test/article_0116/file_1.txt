Since eclipses rarely align perfectly with observatories like those used for deep space research, only two such opportunities have occurred within recent decades: one at l'Observatoire de Haute-Provence France back in '61, followed by another near Mauna Kea Hawaii '91 .
The article details how scientists from various organizations participated during this specific event at La Silla Observatory . They used cameras equipped to capture images during totality as well as multiple large telescopes to observe celestial objects throughout totality . These efforts resulted from collaboration between both public members who attended along with scientific experts from across various fields , including astronomers seeking new knowledge about our universe through these unique events .
Furthermore , the article highlights how some smaller instruments like HELIOS contributed to capturing detailed information about light emitted by celestial bodies during totality through specialized equipment present within its framework . Another group attempted observation but faced technical difficulties despite their best efforts .
