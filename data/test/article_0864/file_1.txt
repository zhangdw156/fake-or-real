To understand the changes in radial velocity, we analyzed the variations in the shapes of photospheric lines by examining the line bisector. We also assessed chromospheric activity by looking at the asymmetry of the Calcium II K line core, which is a strong indicator of chromospheric activity. We identified eight G and K giants whose radial velocity changes are linked to variations in the asymmetry of their spectral line profiles and the emission core of the Calcium II K line. The relationship between bisector velocity span and radial velocity for one of these stars, HD 81797, demonstrates this link. Several of these stars have large sizes, reaching up to 20 milliarcseconds, which could be easily observed by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope Interferometer. As such, they are ideal candidates for observations with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, where surface inhomogeneities can be studied in detail through the analysis of fringe contrast over different wavelengths. AMBER, the near-infrared/red instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, can utilize three telescopes to provide insights into spot geometry as well, with baselines offering up to 1 milliarcsecond angular resolution and a spectral resolution of up to 10,000.
