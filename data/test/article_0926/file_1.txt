NGAS has shown to be a dependable and efficient system. It has handled tens of millions of files, with most issues arising from hardware and software interactions. Considering the use of affordable, off-the-shelf hardware, its reliability is impressive and supports research indicating that inexpensive hardware does not fail much more often than expensive hardware. Currently, the NGAS archive stores all data from the La Silla Paranal Observatory, and nearly all historical ESO data has been transferred to it, making NGAS the main storage solution for the ESO archive. The NG/AMS software's flexibility allows for quick adaptation of the entire system to meet other needs, such as those of ALMA and HST, or for changes in hardware. Recent advancements include using NGAS for a reference implementation of the VOSpace standard from the International Virtual Observatory Alliance. Additionally, a prototype WebDAV interface has been developed on top of NGAS, allowing it to be used as a mountable file system.
