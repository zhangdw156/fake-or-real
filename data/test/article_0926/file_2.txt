NGAS has shown to be a reliable and efficient system. It has handled millions of files, with most issues arising from hardware and software interactions. The reliability is impressive, especially considering the low-cost off-the-shelf hardware used, supporting the finding that inexpensive hardware doesn't fail significantly more than costly hardware. Currently, the NGAS archive stores all data from the La Silla Paranal Observatory and has nearly completed migrating most historical ESO data, establishing itself as the main storage solution for the ESO archive. The NG/AMS software offers flexibility for quick customization to meet different needs, such as for ALMA and HST, or for use with various hardware. Recent developments include utilizing NGAS for a reference implementation of the VOSpace standard by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance. Additionally, a prototype WebDAV interface has been created over NGAS, allowing it to be used as a mountable file system.
