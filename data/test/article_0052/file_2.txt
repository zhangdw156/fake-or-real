The goal is an extensive study called "the 4MOST AGNs" surveying thousands upon thousands of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This project aims at obtaining spectra from roughly eighty percent or more of these objects across both x ray infrared wavelengths—yielding redshifts for as many as one million galaxies!
The project uses data collected by ESA's "eRosita" telescope which covers much larger areas compared to previous surveys like Hubble Space Telescope; it focuses on specific regions within those areas where it has better sensitivity—about three hundred squares degrees around south ecliptic pole are targeted first'. It then adds another component that uses infrared light observations – targeting objects that are likely obscured by dust clouds – this helps build up an even more comprehensive sample!
To identify potential targets within these surveys scientists rely on several methods including analyzing existing catalogs like those made by NASAs Spitzer Space Telescope or combining them together through advanced machine learning algorithms . Using this information they can then select suitable candidates that meet stringent criteria before sending probes towards them via telescopes like James Webb Space Telescope .
