Social Engagement at ESO

In 2007, a presentation was given to the non-profit organization Lebenshilfe Freising e.V., discussing the scientific and technical difficulties that staff members face while working at the ESO observatories in Chile. Lebenshilfe e.V. aims to assist in the development of people with disabilities. This year, seven students and two lecturers from Lebenshilfe e.V. attended a presentation at the ESO headquarters about the Solar System. As an engaging experience for the students, Gerardo Avila from the ESO Instrumentation Division allowed them to look at the Sun through the telescope of the AGAPE amateur astronomers’ group at ESO headquarters. The young adults valued the educational and fascinating afternoon that ESO organized as they approached the end of their schooling. A group of these young people from Lebenshilfe Freising e.V. is shown posed alongside Michael Böcker and Martin Kümmel from ESO in front of the AGAPE telescope in Garching.
