Social Engagement at ESO

In 2007, a presentation was given to the Lebenshilfe Freising e.V. regarding the scientific and technical challenges faced by staff at the ESO observatories in Chile. Lebenshilfe e.V. is a non-profit organization focused on promoting the development of people with disabilities. This year, seven students and two lecturers from Lebenshilfe e.V. were invited to ESO headquarters for a presentation on the Solar System. As a practical highlight for the students, Gerardo Avila from the ESO Instrumentation Division provided a view of the Sun through the AGAPE amateur astronomer’s association telescope at ESO headquarters. The young adults, shown in the above image, greatly enjoyed the informative and engaging afternoon arranged by ESO as a culmination of their school education. A group of young people from Lebenshilfe Freising e.V., along with Michael Böcker and Martin Kümmel from ESO, are pictured in front of the AGAPE telescope in Garching.
