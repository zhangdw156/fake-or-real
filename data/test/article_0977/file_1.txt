All four objects display evidence of the compact discs associated with the ISW model. These discs suggest the likely presence of binary partners, evolving through one of the described scenarios. However, there is no direct evidence for an accompanying star in any case. This lack of evidence might be explained by the significant brightness difference between an AGB star and a main-sequence or white-dwarf companion, but it creates a weak point in the argument. The IR-[WC] stars also exhibit disc structures, and dual-star systems seem probable for these objects. Nonetheless, the strong connection between emission-line central stars and the IR-bright, mixed-chemistry nebulae remains unexplained. The late thermal pulse theory for the [WC] stars does not imply any relationship between the unusual stars and their corresponding nebulae. One possible explanation involves binary merger, which could shed the hydrogen layer in the process. Alternatively, mass transfer from the surrounding disc to the post-AGB star or a white-dwarf companion might be at play. The findings demonstrate the capability of the new high-resolution observation techniques available at the VLT. The sources of the structures observed in these objects are located within 100 AU of the star. Adaptive optics and optical interferometry are particularly effective in analyzing these scale sizes. If only we could also identify the binary companions!
