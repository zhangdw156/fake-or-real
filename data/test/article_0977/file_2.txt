All four objects display signs of the compact disc associated with the ISW model. These discs suggest the presence of binary companions evolving through one of the two scenarios described earlier. However, we do not have direct evidence of a stellar companion in any case. This absence can be explained by the significant brightness difference between an AGB star and a main-sequence or white-dwarf companion, but it weakens the overall argument. The IR-[WC] stars also exhibit a disc shape, and it is likely that these objects are binary. Nonetheless, the strong connection between emission-line central stars and the bright, dual-chemical nebulae remains unclear. The late thermal pulse theory for [WC] stars does not establish a relationship between the peculiar star and the atypical nebula. Binary coalescence might account for this, potentially removing the hydrogen envelope in the process. Alternatively, accretion from the circumstellar disc onto the post-AGB star or a white-dwarf companion could play a role. The findings highlight the effectiveness of the new high-angular-resolution observing techniques available at the VLT. The structures observed in these objects are located within 100 AU of the star. Adaptive optics and optical interferometry are particularly suited to analyze these small scales. If only we could identify the binary companions!
