The most rapidly spinning stars with masses between 6 and 15 times our sun's mass experience breakup due to their high speeds (critical velocity). Early blue-type (B) stars tend to rotate at these highest rates among all types observed so far; we can measure their speed through analyzing how they appear distorted or through observing Doppler shifts within their light spectra caused by rotations themselves - where moving parts shift light frequencies based on movement relative to us on Earth! Using tools like AMBER allows us scientists access unique details about how these rotating bodies change over time - like measuring how much they spin around an axis compared against specific points on them over time - and has been used successfully for studying fast-spinning B star Achernar which spins at roughly 298 kms! This rapid spin enables Be Stars (a less common type) to eject material into surrounding discs called circumstellar discs because they have enough momentum! Utilizing data from AMBER helped confirm what was already suspected: those discs rotate smoothly around central points according Keplers Laws â€“ something first suggested back when Be Stars were discovered centuries ago! Furthermore research has shown those disks expand outward over time forming spiral patterns precessing every few years around their center point .
