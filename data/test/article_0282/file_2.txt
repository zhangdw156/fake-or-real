In October of 2016, a group of experts from across Europe met at Chalmers University to address challenges related to calibrating ALMA's observations (specifically those taken with its Band-5 instrument). They finalized these calibrations before releasing all relevant materials - including raw data sets - on December seventh, 2016 through an online platform called "ALMA SV." A follow-up workshop that took place later that year allowed researchers worldwide to analyze these initial findings about this specific band of light; this analysis helped refine how scientists operate within ALMA's system. This process led directly to incorporating band-five observation into future proposal calls for research projects using this powerful telescope (Cycle-5). Now scientists can use these datasets themselves or contribute new insights through their own research proposals submitted for upcoming cycles of observation with ALMA .
