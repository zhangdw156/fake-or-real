A laser frequency comb consists of thousands of evenly spaced frequencies covering a range of several terahertz (THz). It is derived from femtosecond mode-locked lasers. Shorter laser pulses lead to a wider range of frequencies in the comb. The combâ€™s frequency modes come from the consistent pulse train of the mode-locked laser. The distance between these modes, which is constant in frequency, is determined by the laser's pulse repetition rate and occurs in the radio frequency domain. This repetition rate can easily be synchronized with an exact radio frequency reference like an atomic clock. Atomic clocks currently provide the most accurate measurements of time and frequency. Frequency combs meet two essential features of the ideal calibration source that other methods do not offer: uniform line spacing and long-term stability and reproducibility. The significance of laser comb technology has been broadly recognized, earning the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics for groundbreaking advancements in optical frequency comb methods. Laser frequency combs provide multiple benefits over traditional wavelength calibration sources, including lasting stability for many years; pre-determined absolute wavelengths for each line in the comb; a high precision level limited only by the reference signal, such as atomic clocks or GPS receivers based on required precision. Additionally, the high density and equal spacing of the emission lines across a broad wavelength range allow for very precise tracing and modeling of wavelength solutions in solar spectrum displays, enabling greater signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios.
