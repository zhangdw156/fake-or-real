A laser frequency comb is made up of many evenly spaced frequencies that cover a range of several terahertz (THz). It relies on the characteristics of femtosecond mode-locked lasers. The shorter the laser pulses, the wider the range of frequencies in the comb. The distinct modes of the frequency comb come from the repeating pulse pattern of the mode-locked laser. The spacing between these modes is consistent in frequency and depends on the laser's pulse repetition frequency, which is in the radio frequency range. This repetition frequency can easily be synchronized with an accurate radio frequency reference, like an atomic clock. Atomic clocks provide the most precise measurements of time and frequency, making them among the most accurately determined quantities in physics. Because of this, frequency combs meet two requirements for an ideal calibration source that other methods do not: consistent line spacing and long-term stability and reliability. The innovation of laser combs has been widely acknowledged, and the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for groundbreaking work on the optical frequency comb technique. Laser frequency combs have several advantages over traditional wavelength calibration sources. They offer long-term stability for many years, the absolute wavelength of each line is known without needing prior laboratory measurements, and they provide extremely high precision, limited only by the reference signal, such as an atomic clock or a GPS receiver, depending on the stability needed. Additionally, the high density and equal spacing of the emission lines over a broad wavelength range enable precise tracing and modeling of the wavelength solution at the spectrograph's focal plane, leading to better signal-to-noise detection in spectra.
