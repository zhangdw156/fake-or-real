The spectra of the HCLs are being recorded using a commercial Fourier Transform (FT) spectrometer at ESO. This spectrometer is primarily used for industrial purposes with absorption spectroscopy, but it also has a port for external sources. To mimic the optical path used for internal sources, the light from the external source is focused using an elliptical and a parabolic mirror. Spectra are captured within the spectral range of 3,000 cm–1 to 14,000 cm–1 (3.3 µm to 0.7 µm). For each lamp, the spectrum is recorded at six different operating currents (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 mA) with a resolution of 0.125 cm–1. Between 128 and 1,200 scans (1 hour to 10 hours) are combined for each spectrum to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of all lines. Additionally, to further study the spectral properties of the lamps, spectra are recorded at lower resolutions (1, 4, and 8 cm–1). The spectral lines are identified using various resources, including compilations, databases, publications, and comparisons to Ritz wave numbers, which are calculated from differences in energy between known energy level values. Gaussian profiles are fitted to all visible spectral lines, and the integrated intensity is analyzed based on the lamp's operating current. For each spectral line, the intensity ratio of the line to its intensity in the 10-mA spectrum is calculated. These ratios are then averaged for all lines of the same species at each current, revealing notable differences between the behaviors of gas lines and metal lines. The average behavior of line intensities in relation to current is presented, including only those resolved lines that are present at all currents. This distinct behavior, which can be qualitatively linked to the sputtering effect in HCLs, serves as a valuable method for differentiating between gas and metal lines.
