The spectra of high-current lamps (HCLs) are being recorded using a commercial Fourier Transform (FT) spectrometer at ESO. This type of spectrometer is primarily used in industry for absorption spectroscopy, but it also allows for external light sources. To match the optical path of internal sources, the external light is focused using an elliptical and a parabolic mirror. Spectra are measured within the spectral range from 3,000 cm–1 to 14,000 cm–1 (3.3 µm to 0.7 µm). For each lamp, six different operating currents (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 mA) are used, with a resolution of 0.125 cm–1. Between 128 and 1,200 scans (taking 1 to 10 hours) are combined for each spectrum to enhance signal-to-noise levels. Spectra are also collected with lower resolutions (1, 4, and 8 cm–1) to further analyze the lamps' spectral characteristics. The spectral lines are identified using various references, compilations, and calculations based on published energy levels. Gaussian profiles are fit to all visible spectral lines, and the integrated intensity for each line is examined relative to the lamp current. For each spectral line, the intensity ratio of that line to the intensity in the 10-mA spectrum is computed and then averaged across all lines for each ion species at each current, revealing noticeable differences between gas and metal lines conduction. The average intensity trends as a function of operating current are presented, including only those lines that are clearly resolved at all currents. This characteristic behavior, which can be understood in relation to the sputtering effect in HCLs, serves as an effective means to differentiate between gas and metal lines.
