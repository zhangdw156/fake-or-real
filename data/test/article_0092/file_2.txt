To ensure everyone in ESO has access to these new pipelines, CASU is making them part of an easy-to-use tool called "Reflex." Reflex makes understanding how these complex pipelines work simple because they provide clear visuals on their structure and output along with tools for customization based on individual data needs. For example, users can adjust parameters within one specific pipeline (like HAWK-I) while seeing interactive results that help optimize scientific findings right away when using Reflex workflows from April 2017 onwards! These workflows will be available for anyone interested after this release date alongside tutorials specifically tailored to using them alongside basic sample datasets ready for processing immediately upon download .
