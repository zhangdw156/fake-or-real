The signal journey from injection unit to integrated combiner in this beastly piece of equipment is paved with a peculiar cocktail of light manipulation: specifically, polarisation-maintaining fibres. These fibers, while vital for their task, become a bit like those odd, double vision moments we experience - the signal they carry isn't just passing through; it's being warped and skewed in fascinating ways, leaving behind a phase difference between its principal axes. The consequences are not to be trifled with: imagine one turn of the optical wheel every couple of millimeters, or even less! Even if each fiber is meticulously cut from the same batch, their inherent birefringence will never quite align perfectly - a discrepancy on the level of wavelengths.

We were left grappling with this reality, staring down a daunting road map. We needed to get the signal back in alignment.  And so, the idea arose: we'd insert a special plate within the signal path, like an enigmatic doorman that shifts our polarized dance around. 

This plate is made of lithium niobate, a uniaxial material that has good transmission through the H- and K-bands. We decided to go X-cut – in simpler terms, the extraordinary axis runs parallel to the plane of the plate.  Now, this isn't just any ordinary plate; it’s a player with a special skillset. When placed perpendicular to the beam's path, it introduces a difference in optical path – a differential OPD that boils down to the product of its thickness and the refractive index differential between the ordinary and extraordinary rays (no - ne).

But wait, there's more! If the plate is tilted even slightly about an axis, something truly remarkable happens. Both polarizations follow different geometrical paths, experience distinct optical indices – a dynamic dance that creates a net OPD change based on the angle. Imagine it like throwing a pebble into a still pond; the ripple effect of light traveling through this tilted plate.

Lithium niobate’s qualities made it the perfect candidate for this task - its birefringence (no - ne) = –0.073 at 1.6 μm is no slouch!  And as for wavelength dependence, well, quartz might offer a fleeting glimpse of that, but lithium niobate stands out with only small fluctuations. The plates are a bit like miniature stars aligning - each one is 2 mm thick and tilted by about 20°. This meticulous alignment ensures we get those familiar fringes and wavepackets to line up for optimal detection. Finally, the Wollaston prism is used as an aid to bring this all together – it's not always needed, but when it comes time for analysis, both polarizations are observed jointly on the same pixel detector.

This dance of light has been carefully choreographed -  just like Bowie's "Space Oddity" suggests, "There was a shadow cast/ And I heard the sound of my name/ Through the cosmic dust and stars..." This is how we create a reality, one pixel at a time, where the signal shines.
