The use of special fibers to carry signals from a source to a combiner causes them to exhibit strong birefringence, meaning they generate a phase difference between their axis at a rate of one full turn per few millimeters.  Even with careful fiber length matching and using identical batches, these fibres don't perfectly match in their birefringence, leading to a noticeable difference in the optical path distance (OPD) for each polarization, typically around several wavelengths. In the initial design, two linearly polarized signals were separated by a Wollaston prism and then detected separately. This method is known to have drawbacks concerning signal-to-noise ratio and reading speed. To address this, a birefringent plate made of lithium niobate was inserted into the signal path between the tip-tilt mirror and injection parabola. 

Lithium niobate is a good material for this approach because it transmits well in the H- and K-bands. Additionally, its large birefringence difference (no - ne) of -0.073 at 1.6 μm and low wavelength dependence makes it suitable for compensation in this case. The plates are 2 mm thick and tilted around 20°. A Wollaston prism is inserted first, followed by adjusting the tilt to ensure that both wave packets and individual fringes coincide between the two polarizations on each of the six baselines. Then, the Wollaston prism is removed. Co-aligned fringes from both polarization signals are then detected jointly on a single detector pixel.
