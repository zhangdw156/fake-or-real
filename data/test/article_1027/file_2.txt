The simulation results mentioned suggest that it should be feasible to acquire good quality spectra for faint astronomical objects using VIMOS spectroscopic observations in MOS mode, with a stare mode observing approach. The primary benefit of this method is the ability to use MOS slits that are, on average, half the length of those employed in traditional jitter mode observations. This shorter slits technique could roughly double the efficiency or total yield of spectroscopic surveys conducted with VIMOS, relative to what has been achieved with previous surveys like the VVDS and zCOSMOS. However, this improvement would only be possible for deeper surveys where the number of target candidates is at least twice the number of slits available for a MOS mask. Recognizing the significant implications of these findings for upcoming spectroscopic surveys, we proposed a verification of our results. Thus, we submitted a small Directorâ€™s Discretionary Time proposal to ESO for one survey-like observation using VIMOS, short-slit masks, and stare mode exposures. This was approved and carried out as program 281.A-5044 (A) on September 26, 2008. The data analysis using both the traditional method and our proposed approach shows clear differences. Comparing the two methods indicates that the new fringing subtraction technique is quite effective. To better assess its impact, we systematically compared the fluctuations in the residual background levels in the blue region (free of fringing) and the red region (affected by fringing) of the two-dimensional spectra. In cases where the old method retains the full fringing pattern, variations in the red section of the background are six to eight times larger than in the blue section. However, for data processed with the new fringing removal method, the variations in the red part are only two to four times greater than in the blue part. To illustrate how these residuals affect the final one-dimensional spectra for the same object from both data processing methods, a comparison shows a considerable reduction in noise in the red area of the final spectra with our new technique. This technique will be implemented in the VIMOS Interactive Pipeline Graphical Interface (VIPGI) data reduction pipeline and made available to the entire astronomical community with the public release of VIPGI 1.4.
