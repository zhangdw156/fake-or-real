The simulation results mentioned earlier suggest that good quality spectra for faint astronomical targets can be achieved from VIMOS spectroscopic observations in MOS mode using a stare mode observing technique. The main benefit of using stare mode is that it allows for MOS slits that are, on average, half the length of those used in traditional jitter mode observations. This reduction in slit length would effectively double either the efficiency or total yield for spectroscopic surveys using VIMOS compared to the efficiency or yield from the VVDS and zCOSMOS surveys. However, this improvement can only be realized in a deep survey where potential targets are at least twice the number of slits that can fit on a MOS mask. Recognizing the significant impact of this finding on future spectroscopic surveys, we proposed a direct on-sky verification of our results. We submitted a small Directorâ€™s Discretionary Time proposal to ESO for one spectroscopic survey-like observation with VIMOS using short-slit masks and stare mode exposures. This proposal was approved as program 281.A-5044 (A) and executed on September 26, 2008. The data reduction results using both traditional methods and the new technique clearly show that the new fringing subtraction method is highly effective. To quantify this impact, we systematically compared the root mean square variations in the residual background level (after sky subtraction) of the two-dimensional spectra between the red spectral region (which is affected by fringing) and the blue region (which is not affected). In cases where the data still contained the full fringing pattern, variations in the red background were six to eight times larger than those in the blue. However, for the data reduced with the new fringing removal technique, the variations in the red background were only two to four times larger than in the blue. To illustrate the effect of these residuals on the final one-dimensional spectra, a comparison of extracted one-dimensional spectra for the same object from both processing methods clearly shows that the noise in the red part of the final spectra is significantly reduced by our new data reduction technique. This new technique is included in the VIMOS Interactive Pipeline Graphical Interface (VIPGI) data reduction pipeline and will be made available to the entire astronomical community with the public release of VIPGI version 1.4.
