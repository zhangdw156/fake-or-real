Omega_g is approximately equal to 0.02205 ± 0.00028. Baryons constitute a small proportion of the overall matter and energy density of the universe. Recent observations have significantly altered our understanding of baryonic matter within the observable universe. Baryonic gas plays a key role in star formation, transforming into neutral hydrogen clouds which later coalesce into molecules in molecular clouds.  The evolution of neutral hydrogen density (Omega_g) on cosmological scales can offer insights into the consumption of gas as it fuels star formation. The observed Omega_g value for high-redshift quasar absorbers is expressed as a fraction of today's critical density. However, previous estimations of baryonic contributions from sub-Damped Lyman-alpha systems were limited.  Simulations suggest that the gas in sub-Damped Lyman-alpha systems are dispersed across extended halos while those in Damped Lyman-alpha systems tend to be located in denser and more compact regions. Both systems contribute a reservoir of neutral gas, serving as indicators for recent star formation activity. Researchers utilized a curated subset of the EUADP dataset to analyze statistical properties of Damped Lyman-alpha and sub-Damped Lyman-alpha systems, exploring their column density distribution and the contribution of sub-Damped Lyman-alpha systems to the total gas mass density. The researchers combined samples from Péroux et al. (2003) and Péroux et al. (2005), respectively, for improved statistical results.  The high spectral resolution of EUADP allowed for a determination of hydrogen column density distribution (f_HI(N,z)) down to log N_HI = 19.0. The column density distribution describes the evolution of quasar absorbers as a function of atomic column density and redshift. A flattening in f_HI(N,z) is observed within sub-Damped Lyman-alpha systems at higher redshifts, suggesting these systems might merge or be more shielded by cosmic time as it progresses. The f_HI(N,z) distribution was split into two redshift bins (1.5 < z < 3 and 3 < z < 5). The redshift evolution of f_HI(N,z) is evident, implying the presence of more sub-Damped Lyman-alpha systems at high redshift compared to low redshift. This development suggests that sub-Damped Lyman-alpha systems might merge or become more self-shielded over cosmic time.  Analysis of the six redshift bins (with a step increase of z = 0.5) further determined the total neutral hydrogen gas mass density, Omega_g, between 1.5 < z < 5.0. The findings indicate that sub-Damped Lyman-alpha systems play an important role across all redshifts, and their contribution to Omega_g increases from 8–20 percent, with a greater fraction observed at higher redshift.
