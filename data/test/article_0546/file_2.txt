Accurately modeling telluric absorption isn't just about crafting a good theoretical model; it provides a crucial window into the real-world spectral complexities of our target celestial bodies. This precision is vital, particularly when dealing with high-resolution near- and mid-infrared spectra where wavelength calibration presents an arduous challenge. Unlike simple gas lamps used in low-resolution instruments, rare gases (like Helium or Xenon) offer meager line density, severely limiting accuracy. Even the rich ThAr emission lines, widely employed in high-resolution optical spectrographs, are a poor fit for this task, particularly at near-infrared wavelengths.  

The typical spectral coverage of CRIRES detectors is often too narrow to capture full spectral detail needed for optimal calibration. The vast contrast between Th and Ar lines in the ThAr emission spectrum results in an extreme dynamic range, leaving weaker spectral features struggling with low signal-to-noise ratios while stronger lines overpower them all, hindering effective calibration.  For many years now, chemical radicals like OH* emission from atmospheric airglow have played a role in wavelength calibration. While they appear as emission lines, and are more readily available in the near-infrared, these lines often lack the sufficient density for accurate calibration at higher resolutions. 

Furthermore, the use of OH* for calibration is hampered by their weak line density and limited spatial coverage.  CRIRES's small pixel scale (86 milliarcseconds per pixel) further complicates matters as each individual pixel spans a tiny portion of the celestial target. This means we need to rely on regular molecules within our model, like LBLRTM, whose strong absorption lines provide a natural in situ wavelength calibration source. Since these lines are imprinted during data acquisition and captured by the spectrograph instrument right when they reach the detector,  we get rid of the "lamp emission" effect that often plagues spectral analysis. This inherent precision offers a much greater level of accuracy than the emission-based sources we've discussed so far, especially considering that lamp emissions may vary due to potential changes in the spectrograph setup over hours later.
