Fitting telluric absorption lines to observed spectra provides not only a model of those lines but also accurate wavelength solutions. This is valuable because accurately calibrating wavelengths for high-resolution near-infrared and mid-infrared spectroscopy can be difficult. 

Commonly used lamps, like Helium, Neon, Xenon, and Krypton (HeNeXeKr), provide sparse line density and are inadequate for highly resolved spectrometers. Even though the ThAr emission line lamp often employed by high-resolution optical spectrographs has rich spectra, it exhibits lower line density in the near-infrared compared to the red optical part of the spectrum.  The typical spectral coverage of a CRIRES detector is about l/200, leading to many remaining poorly calibrated settings. Additionally, the dynamic range of the ThAr emission spectrum is exceptionally high due to strong contrast between Th and Ar lines. This results in weaker lines with low signal-to-noise ratios and saturation of brighter nearby lines, making calibration difficult. 

Near-infrared wavelength calibration often relies on airglow emission from OH*. However, this chemical radical exhibits weak line density and its transitions originate from non-LTE processes, which means they don't appear clearly in astronomical spectra as well as in absorption measurements. The small spatial pixel scale of CRIRES (86 milliarcseconds/pixel) makes the use of OH* lines particularly challenging. 

In contrast, regular molecules like those modeled by LBLRTM exhibit a high density of strong absorption lines, making them suitable for direct wavelength calibration. These features are imprinted in the source spectrum before reaching the spectrograph. Consequently, these lines undergo the same instrumental effects as the intrinsic lines observed in stellar spectra, providing a more precise and stable calibration compared to emission line sources commonly used with long-slit spectroscopy. Since these lamp emissions are recorded separately from the science spectra, they often happen hours after the data acquisition for potential changes within the spectrograph setup.
