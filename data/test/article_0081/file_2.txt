The Cosmic Structure Survey (CRS) will provide detailed views of how galaxies are arranged across vast cosmic distances—from tiny voids between galaxies all the way out into vast clusters—and across different points in time during galaxy evolution (redshift). This ability comes from its extensive collection of distant galaxies and quasars which allows it track how much space has expanded since then universe began forming structures like those we see today! The CRS Lya survey goes even deeper by analyzing faint light from hydrogen atoms called Lyman-alpha emissions at extremely fine resolutions making it possible for scientists study even smaller structures within those very same regions where they look for evidence on dark matter or other mysterious phenomena affecting their evolution! By combining this data with observations about how fast space is expanding over time (BAO), researchers can test fundamental ideas about cosmology like whether space itself is constantly changing shape or not - essentially checking whether our understanding holds true under extreme conditions!
