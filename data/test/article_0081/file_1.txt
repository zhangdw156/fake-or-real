The Cosmic Structure Survey (CRS) will provide detailed views of how galaxies are arranged across vast cosmic distancesâ€”from tiny voids within clusters all the way out past large structures like galaxy clusters themselves at different points in time (redshift). This ability comes from its extensive sample size including many galaxies at various redshifts which allows scientists studying these structures at smaller scales than ever before thanks largely due it's greater sensitivity compared with other surveys like DESI . This data can help determine cosmological parameters such as distance between objects across vast stretches of space and how quickly they expand through measuring light emitted by distant objects called quasars or near infrared emission from early star formation regions known as Ly forest . By combining this information with measures taken on how fast spacetime is expanding over time , scientists can test existing theories about how our universe works by examining if there are inconsistencies or deviations from what we currently understand about gravity's influence on spacetime evolution .
