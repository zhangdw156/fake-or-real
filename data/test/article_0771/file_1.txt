For NGC 5135 and the second object, NGC 7469, we estimate that within the closest 3.0 arcseconds around the AGN, roughly 45 percent of the mid-infrared flux comes from sources other than the AGN. This result for NGC 7469 aligns well with a direct comparison of our VISIR data to archived spectra taken by the IRS instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope, which tracks down to about 3.0 arcseconds. We made similar comparisons for all objects that we observed with at least two mid-infrared filters and had accompanying IRS archival data. We encountered discrepancies between the IRS and VISIR fluxes in some instances, particularly where continuous emission was absent in the VISIR imagery. One instance is detailed in the text. We believe this inconsistency arises from smooth, extended emission that VISIR misses due to its lower sensitivity for such flux. In a few situations, temporal variations in flux between the two observing periods might contribute to this effect; however, it's unlikely to be the cause. The non-nuclear emission spotted, either directly via VISIR or via comparisons to the Spitzer results, emphasizes that focusing on high angular resolution instead of the superior sensitivity of space telescopes was ideal for our goals. While we cannot completely eliminate the possibility of significant contamination in our own data, it is assuredly less than for analyses performed with larger aperture settings. We will delve deeper into the issue of contamination in our data in the next section.
