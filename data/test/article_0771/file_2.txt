For NGC 5135 and another object, NGC 7469, we estimate that about 45 percent of the mid-infrared (MIR) flux within the innermost 3.0 arcseconds around the active galactic nucleus (AGN) does not come from the AGN itself. For NGC 7469, this aligns well with a comparison of our VISIR data and archival spectra obtained with the IRS instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope, which has a resolution of about 3.0 arcseconds. We conducted this comparison for all objects where we had observations in at least two MIR filters and corresponding archival IRS data. Notably, we observed some significant differences between the IRS and VISIR fluxes in cases where no extended emission was evident in the VISIR images. One example of this is described in the text. We attribute this discrepancy to smooth, extended emission not seen in VISIR due to its limited sensitivity to such emissions. While variations in flux due to time changes between the two observation periods are unlikely to be the cause of this issue, they cannot be entirely dismissed. The extra-nuclear emission, whether detected by VISIR or inferred from the Spitzer data, emphasizes that prioritizing high angular resolution over the sensitivity of space telescopes was the correct choice for our study. Although we cannot exclude significant contamination in our data, it is expected to be much less than in larger aperture observations. We will discuss the issue of contamination in our data in more detail in the following section.
