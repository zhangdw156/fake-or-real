We used the VIMOS IFU to study the star-forming regions, galactic superwinds, and metal enrichment in a gravitationally lensed galaxy at redshift z = 5, which corresponds to a time when the Universe was only about 10% of its current age. These findings allow us to examine galaxy formation and evolution in unprecedented detail and open up new opportunities for future research on early galaxies. The challenge with galaxy-formation models lies not in explaining how galaxies form—this occurs due to the cooling and condensing of gas in dark matter halos—but in understanding why such a small proportion of baryons cool to become stars. Current models suggest that over 50% of baryons should lead to star formation, but surveys in the local Universe reveal that less than 10% are actually turned into stars, with the remainder in a hot, diffuse state similar to that found in the inter-cluster medium. To resolve this contradiction, some form of feedback is needed—an approach that expels gas from galaxies and restricts star formation, thereby regulating the process of galaxy formation.
