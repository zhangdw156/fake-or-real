When the Very Large Telescope (VLT) began its science operations in 1999, it marked a significant breakthrough in Polish observational techniques.  The way it was operated differed dramatically from La Silla's model. For instance, the introduction of observation blocks (OBs), along with its unprecedented pointing precision through UTs, eliminated the need for manual instrument adjustments or fine-tuning, transforming astronomical observations into a streamlined process. 

However, learning to build efficient OBs proved crucial. If not perfected, time could be wasted readjusting instruments constantly or adjusting telescope settings.  Although the optical concept behind FORS appears straightforward, its technical implementation turned out to be remarkably complex. Each FORS instrument is equipped with over fifty motors, many of which are small precision units that control multi-slits with sub-arcsecond accuracy and even larger ones responsible for heavy filters and grism wheels or collimator exchange – all meticulously engineered into a unified system.  Despite these technical challenges, the FORS instruments consistently maintain top spots for reliability at Paranal due to the meticulous design, engineering, manufacturing, and testing undertaken by the FORS consortium over a decade ago.

The fact that each FORS instrument boasts over 50 motors, most of them small precision units for fine-tuning multi-slits with sub-arcsecond accuracy, and even larger ones used for heavy filters and grism wheels or collimator exchange underscores its technological complexity.  These instruments require a particularly adept operational team at Paranal to accurately insert the correct components and execute the necessary calibration OBs – each evening. This meticulous process is now supported by sophisticated software tools that were developed in response to the challenges our early Paranal post-doctoral team faced when piecing together calibration sequences from outdated log entries.

Considering how far we've come since then, the success achieved with FORS instruments is undeniable. Many users did not welcome the decision to mothball FORS1 for its successor, X-shooter.  However, we are eagerly awaiting the exciting future of FORS2 observations and their potential contribution to astronomical understanding, not only as a powerful tool for imaging but also for low-resolution spectroscopy. After all, how could the VLT remain truly innovative without a reliable imaging/low-resolution spectrograph like FORS?
