The Very Large Telescope (VLT) began using its advanced systems for observation in 1999. However, the initial setup was different from La Silla's approach. The new system featured innovative observation blocks (OBs), precise pointing of UTs (using techniques that automatically adjusted and minimized manual focus adjustments) and a more streamlined design.  

While these improvements greatly simplified observations, operators had to learn how to build efficient OBs to minimize time spent on instrument reconfiguration or telescope settings adjustments. The FORS system's advanced technical aspects are visible in its complexity despite the simplicity of its optical design. 

FORS instruments feature over 50 motors, some very small and precise, driving multi-slits with sub-arcsecond accuracy, others large for turning heavy filter and grism wheels or exchanging collimators like a small telescope. Despite this intricate nature, both FORS instruments maintain high reliability due to careful design by the FORS consortium years ago.  

Because they can operate as multi-mode instruments with numerous filters and gratings, the FORS instruments pose unique challenges for Paranal's operations team each evening; they require precise component insertion and calibration procedures before observations start. To overcome these complexities, software tools were developed after early difficulties during their initial implementation. 

The development of these tools stemmed from challenges faced by early Paranal post-doctoral researchers in assembling the calibration sequences from entries made in paper log sheets written during long night shifts for astronomers experiencing fatigue. Considering the significant advances and successes achieved with FORS instruments, it is understandable why users were initially hesitant regarding the mothballing of FORS1 to make way for the newer X-shooter. However, exciting FORS2 observations and findings are anticipated in the future - as these tools will remain essential components in VLT's operation.
