The Zodiacal Light originates within our inner solar system where tiny ice and dust grains orbit around our sun due to its influence on them via two main forces: the Poynting-Robertson effect which pulls them inward due to absorbing sunlight; and Solar Radiation Pressure which pushes them outward but not fast enough for long term survival so they need constant replenishment .
This replenishment comes mostly through decaying icy comets but also potentially asteroids or interstellar debris which contributes significantly towards creating what we see as Zodiac Light â€“ scattered sunlight coming toward us because it hits these tiny cosmic debris like microscopic mirrors across our sky!
A significant portion (over 85) originates specifically from Dust associated with short period comets called Jupiter Family Comets which have orbits influenced heavily by gravity's pull exerted by Jupiter .
You can observe this phenomenon best when viewing it directly overhead or near its center where you will see a faint band across constellations forming an arc shape called "Zodiac". As you move further away or look towards opposite directions (antisolar point) there will be variations seen based on how much scattering occurs!
