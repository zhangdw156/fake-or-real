wandera the source can be traced back within our own solar system's interior where tiny ice and dust grains orbit near our sun based on infrared observations made by various space observatories like IRAS COBE we see these magic little bits move under two main forces: gravity pulling them inwards due to its own heat energy (the PoYnting - Robertson effect) and another force fueled by absorbing more energy which keeps it moving outward (The Magic Bullet). Because they're constantly being pulled down into closer proximity with other objects they have been around since time immemorial! However there isn's enough magic for us all so some additional supplies come through older celestial bodies such as rogue asteroids or even remnants left over after other star systems were born! Our own earth doesn' You can think about it like looking up at night when you see those bright lights sprinkled across your vision... That's just what we call "The Magic Carpet" because each individual grain acts like an extension arm sending forth tiny pieces off into space while also getting its fill if you will... What makes things even more interesting though? It turns out most magic carpet fibers actually come straight down form different parts outside our local neighborhood filled with different types o f debris including some really old ones called 'Jupiter Family Comets'. One example recently examined was '67PChuryumov - Gerasim enko', which became an international sensation when someone went on board a rocket ship named 'Rosetta'. For instance one can observe how much each individual piece contributes towards filling up this beautiful sight for us here on earth! And speaking about observation points.. Those who pay attention will notice something neat happening near where our sun resides â€“ there Here we have another fascinating phenomenon called "The Magic Eye", or "The Anti-Magic Carpet," residing somewhere else entirely outside EarthS orbit!
