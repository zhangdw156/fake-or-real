ymce explanation
To understand massive stars in a particular region called "the central molecular zone," researchers are observing them at different points in time using powerful telescopes like VLT's SINFONI KMOS instruments. This allows them to identify pairs or groups within these clusters as well as study fainter stars hidden by dust clouds. These findings are further analyzed using data obtained through other means like NASA's Hubble Space Telescope's NICMOS WFC3 instruments star characteristics can then be estimated based on how much light they emit across different wavelengths compared to what we know about how real stars should behave under specific conditions known as nonlocal thermal equilibrium models .
