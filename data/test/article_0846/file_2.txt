Key questions include: How do planetary systems form? What role does feedback play in star formation? What determines stellar masses and the Initial Mass Function? The radial velocity technique, which detects planets by observing their effect on their stars through Doppler shifts, is a powerful method for studying low-mass planets and could potentially identify Earth-mass planets with an Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Achieving radial velocity measurement accuracy of 0.1 m/s would clarify the entire theoretical formation model. The black dots represent expected detections, while the blue circles depict a comparable group of known exoplanets. A sharp cutoff at about 5 AU results from a ten-year duration for the radial velocity survey. This method will estimate the masses of planets found through future transit studies like COROT and KEPLER. The ELT’s large collecting area and spatial resolution will enable direct detection of exoplanets, as previously mentioned. Additionally, direct luminosity measurements of planets will provide critical information about their formation conditions. ELT thermal-IR spectroscopy may differentiate between brown dwarfs and exoplanets using carbon monoxide lines.

Direct imaging with an ELT can search for planets around white dwarfs 4–5 magnitudes deeper than current capabilities, revealing new targets and enabling the detection of planets with masses around 1–3 MJup, which will inform us about the later stages of planetary system evolution. The ELT’s spatial resolution is particularly valuable for conducting a census of binary stars in clusters, helping to understand their formation processes. For instance, the ELT can measure the dynamical masses of brown dwarf binaries through astrometry. Its high spatial resolution will also facilitate studies of dust accumulation and processing in proto-planetary disks. Indicators of planet formation, such as gaps and warping in disks, should be detectable through near- and mid-infrared imaging in dust and debris disks. New simulations suggest that the ELT could observe local heating in disks caused by a planet. The ELT's capacity for detecting a wide dynamic range makes it well-suited for examining the outer planet-forming regions of disks, complementing interferometric studies of the inner areas. Furthermore, the ELT could map the magnetic field strength in the disks of T-Tauri stars in nearby star-forming regions and assess the magnetic field topology on stellar surfaces using techniques like Zeeman-Doppler imaging.
