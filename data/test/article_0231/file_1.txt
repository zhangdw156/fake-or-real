Infrared interferometry allows astronomers to create incredibly detailed images by combining light signals from multiple telescopes like pieces fitting together perfectly like puzzle pieces! This technique can resolve features as small as milliseconds making it ideal for studying everything from distant planets orbiting other stars to understanding active galactic nuclei at their core .
The quality depends on how far apart these telescopes are placed - this distance forms what we call "baselines." The baseline provides information about how bright different parts appear across our sky and this information forms "visibilities", which essentially act like fingerprints showing us all those tiny details within those bright spots across our sky!
The challenge lies in reconstructing these visual fingerprints into recognizable images because there's simply too much detail compared with what we have for capturing it; think about trying fit all those puzzle pieces together perfectly! To overcome this problem scientists use special mathematical techniques called "iterative regularised least squares minimisation" that work by finding patterns within these blurry pictures until they form clear shapes!
