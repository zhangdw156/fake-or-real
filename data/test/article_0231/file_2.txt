astronauts can use powerful ground-based robotic systems called "robotic arms" that combine their views by looking at Earth's surface with high precision cameras and then combine those separate views into one big picture for better results when looking for faint signals like faint light coming from other planets... they also get really good at seeing details like fine details on things like asteroid tracks... they can see these things because they have many eyes working together...
