While the color selection is very precise based on the detailed data provided, it's still crucial to obtain a spectrum of the candidates to accurately measure their redshift and learn about their physical and chemical properties. Accurate redshifts give the time information needed to understand the evolution of galaxy mass, shape, clustering, and star formation. This is the purpose of the spectroscopic follow-up conducted by our team with FORS2 at the ESO/VLT. I-band dropouts (along with B- and V-band dropouts) have been recorded in multiple spectroscopic masks and combined to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, with total exposure times ranging from 10,000 to about 80,000 seconds. The quality of redshift determinations varies (7 are definite, 13 are possible, and 13 are tentative) and will be detailed in an upcoming paper. Currently, the success rate of color selection for these very high-redshift galaxies is 96%. As expected, most galaxies with a redshift above 5.4 have an (i–z) color greater than 1.3, while five sources have an (i–z) color less than 1.3. These are galaxies with redshifts between 5.4 and 5.6, close to the redshift selection limit using a simple color criterion. Some have been identified as V-dropout sources. Utilizing the photometric redshift technique, which leverages all available photometric data in the GOODS field, will enhance the selection process for high-redshift galaxies.
