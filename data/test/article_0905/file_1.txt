Even the most advanced space missions that gather data on-site still require remote sensing data to better understand their findings in a broader scientific context. Our knowledge of the Solar System is incomplete, and more surveys are urgently needed. A chance occurrence, called occultation, shows potential for detecting faint objects. For studying asteroids and comets, systematic statistical analyses of their shapes, sizes, brightness, and rotation will heavily rely on both ground-based telescopes and the James Webb Space Telescope. The same applies to examining their surface chemistry. Significant discoveries may be expected in the study of planetary atmospheres. Currently, we do not fully understand how planetary atmospheres resist erosion from solar UV radiation and particle flux; high-resolution spectral and spatial observations could greatly enhance our understanding of these processes. To connect observations and theories about extra-solar protoplanetary discs with our own Solar System, more mineralogical information about primitive bodies in our Solar System is essential. European astronomers are well-positioned for these research initiatives, thanks to their involvement with ALMA and the tools being developed for the E-ELT. The METIS instrument and EPICS are particularly important for Solar System research. During a breakout session, some attendees gathered to form a working group aimed at enhancing the Science Case of the E-ELT with a specific section on the Solar System. Plans for follow-up activities for this group are currently in the works.
