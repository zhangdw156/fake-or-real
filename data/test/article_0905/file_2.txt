High-level space missions that gather data directly need remote sensing data to understand their findings better. The inventory of the Solar System is not complete, and more surveys are required. New methods for observing faint objects show potential. Ground-based telescopes, along with the James Webb Space Telescope, will be essential for studying the shapes, sizes, brightness, and rotation of asteroids and comets. The same applies to analyzing their surface chemistry. Significant discoveries can be anticipated in studying planetary atmospheres, where the impact of solar UV radiation and particle tracks is still unclear. High-resolution observations could greatly enhance our understanding of these processes. To connect the observations of protoplanetary discs beyond our Solar System with our own, we need more mineral data on primitive bodies within the Solar System. European astronomers will play a key role in these research efforts due to their involvement with ALMA and the instruments being developed for the E-ELT. The METIS instrument and EPICS will be particularly important for Solar System research. In a separate session, some attendees formed a working group to add a Solar System section to the E-ELT Science Case, and plans for future activities among the group are forthcoming.
