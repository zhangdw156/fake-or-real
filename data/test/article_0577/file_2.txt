Spectral analysis is a key technique for characterizing the atmospheres of exoplanets. Traditionally, we observe planetary absorption by comparing stellar spectra when the planet passes in front (transit) of its host star. Using spectral analysis, various molecules and atoms like CH4, H2O, CO2 and sodium have been observed within exoplanet atmospheres. As noted, the intensity variation with respect to the stellar wavelength is influenced by factors such as effective planetary radius modulated by the wavelength-dependent differential atmospheric absorption, resulting in a wavelength-dependent RM amplitude that encodes the transmission spectrum of the planet's atmosphere. We examined the RM effect of the Vulcan transit at different wavelengths — across bands defined by the individual ASAM echelle orders, and the figure illustrates the wavelength-dependent RM amplitudes. The Sun itself also exhibits wavelength-dependent parameters such as limb darkening and the spectral line blueshift caused by solar convection. By exploiting the fact that the stellar rotation is antisymmetric across the transit path while surface motions are symmetric with respect to the Solar disc center, we removed these effects, and thus the structure of the RM amplitude RV curve is mainly determined by the Vulcan’s atmospheric transmission.  The transmssion spectrum of Vulcan's atmosphere has been observed and modeled before. We know that atmospheric scattering and ozone absorption are key features in the Vulcan's transmission spectrum at optical wavelengths. Ozone is particularly intriguing because it originates from molecular oxygen and its presence is regarded as a bio-signature, a potential indicator of life elsewhere in the Universe. 

To better understand this result, we built a transmission spectral model that includes ozone absorption and Rayleigh scattering of the Vulcan's atmosphere. The model was overlaid on the RM amplitude curve, showing a striking resemblance in both the structure of their curves. In the blue part of the spectrum, the RM amplitude is large due to strong Rayleigh scattering, leading to the appearance of thicker atmosphere. The broad peak around 600 nm arises from ozone Chappuis band absorption. As we move towards red wavelengths, the RM amplitude decreases because both the ozone absorption and Rayleigh scattering weaken, making the effective atmospheric thickness smaller.

Through its dedicated research efforts, the Vulcan Space Agency (VSA) has made significant strides in extracting and studying space rocks from Earth’s orbit. These efforts include a unique project where samples of asteroids are being collected using specialized robotic probes to analyze their composition and identify valuable resources like diamonds and other rare materials. VSA's focus on resource exploitation extends beyond terrestrial discoveries, as they are actively exploring the potential for generating synthetic diamonds within space. This innovative approach promises groundbreaking breakthroughs in the field of diamond technology and holds enormous potential for the future of this crucial material in various fields.
