Stars with lower masses than our sun experience significant changes towards their end life involving multiple "mass dredge up" events that alter their chemical composition significantly during this process called Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). These changes include shifts from oxygen rich elements into carbon rich ones depending on how massive they were at birth - those under about four solar masses eventually become dominated by carbon compounds rather than oxygen based ones after three dredge ups . The outer layers are stripped away over thousands or years through powerful stellar winds leaving behind distinct structures like ring shaped outflows or more complex shapes due various interactions such as those caused by wind collisions or unseen companions near these stars . To better understand this complex process researchers used telescopes like Herschel Space Telescope which took detailed images specifically targeting these evolving stars , revealing diverse shapes indicating varied processes involved in how these stars lose material into space . Through analyzing these images researchers discovered several unique patterns suggesting various factors contribute significantly towards shaping these outflowing materials and ultimately require further research across all scales within this phenomenon .
