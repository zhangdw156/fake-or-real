KMOS will be one of the most intricate astronomical instruments ever made for a ground-based telescope, featuring over 60 moving parts in its cryogenic systems alone. Strong and effective software, along with dependable control electronics, will be critical for long-term success. KMOS will convey control software and operational diagnostics, and will include an optimized tool known as KARMA within the ESO’s observation preparation software. KARMA will allocate targets to different arms by prioritizing selections, while preventing invalid positions, and will allow for manual adjustments to the target list. A special data processing pipeline will enable rescuing targets across different visits and checking data quality after each collection. Given that it captures over 4000 spectra per lighting, automated data processing and reduction techniques will be crucial to harness KMOS’s full scientific capabilities. The project is currently in its preliminary design phase expected to be shipped to Paranal by mid-2010, with a schedule of essential milestones included.
