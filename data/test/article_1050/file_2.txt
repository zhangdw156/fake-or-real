KMOS will be one of the most intricate astronomical instruments ever made for a ground-based telescope, featuring over 60 degrees of freedom in its cryogenic mechanisms alone. Effective software and dependable control electronics will be critical for its long-term success. Besides the instrument control software and housekeeping diagnostics, KMOS will include an optimized target allocation tool known as KARMA, part of the ESO observation preparation software. KARMA will prioritize targets while ensuring that no invalid arm positions are chosen and will allow users to manually adjust the list of assigned targets. A tailored data reduction pipeline will be available, enabling observers to accurately locate targets during multiple visits to the same area and assess data quality after each readout. With more than 4000 spectra per integration, automated data processing and reduction techniques will be crucial to maximize KMOS's scientific capabilities. The project is currently in the preliminary design phase and is projected to be shipped to Paranal in mid-2010. A list of important milestones is included.
