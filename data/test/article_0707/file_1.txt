The main result of the workshop is that there are two instruments available at the VLT—VIMOS and FLAMES—that can be used right away to address some key scientific issues discussed during the meeting. The current ESO wide-field multi-object spectrographs will keep the ESO community at the forefront of research until 2015, when new global facilities are expected to become operational. However, while FLAMES has recently received upgrades with a new detector, VIMOS urgently needs repairs to achieve the survey efficiency necessary for its scientific objectives. An upgrade for VIMOS is planned for next year, which is expected to improve its reliability. The workshop participants support ESO's plan to enhance VIMOS's red sensitivity (by replacing its CCDs) and to resolve some mechanical issues that have affected its operation in the past. There is a suggestion to conduct large public surveys to tackle some of the astrophysics problems mentioned earlier, which could position the European community advantageously before other observatories launch instruments with significant multiplexing capabilities. This topic was presented to the STC for recommendations and advice. A timely call for large cosmological redshift surveys could place European astronomy at the leading edge of these fields, provided the surveys are finished before 2014. Likewise, initiating ground-based Gaia preparatory surveys soon would significantly help generate the data needed to complement Gaia. Regarding new instrument proposals, the workshop's conclusion is to recommend that ESO solicit concepts for wide-field instruments, which could consist of either new instruments or upgrades to existing ones, following the ideas presented during the workshop. Consistent with a prior STC recommendation, these concepts must not include changes to the VLT telescopes that could compromise their interferometric mode. Therefore, any instrument at the VLT should have a maximum field of view of 30 arcminutes while maintaining a large multiplexing capability of 500 or more. The scientific requirements necessitate resolutions ranging from R = 1000 to R = 40,000, with a broad wavelength range spanning 350 nm to 2.2 microns.
