A blue multiplexed spectrograph on a 4 or 8-meter telescope, equipped with over 100 fibers, offers high sensitivity in the blue range (signal-to-noise ratio of about 30-40) and a high resolving power (20,000-30,000) to analyze the chemical makeup of 20,000-50,000 stars in the halo, thick disk, and outer thin disk. This can be mounted on an 8-meter telescope with a field of view (FOV) of approximately 0.5 square degrees, or on a 4-meter telescope with a FOV of around 2.5 square degrees. An infrared multiplexed spectrograph designed for a dedicated 4-meter telescope, featuring adaptive optics correction, extensive multiplexing (over 500 fibers), a signal-to-noise ratio of about 20-30, high resolving power (20,000-30,000), and a large field of view, would enable the measurement of detailed abundances and radial velocities for 20,000-50,000 stars in the obscured Bulge and thin disk. A lower resolution mode would be beneficial for fainter targets not observed by the RVS on Gaia. ESO may also explore partnerships with teams initiating the development of these instruments. In addition, an infrared multiplexed spectrograph on an 8-meter telescope should be considered for enhancing the capabilities of current VLT multiplexed spectrographs for a larger field of view and infrared wavelengths.
