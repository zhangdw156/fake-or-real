A blue multiplexed spectrograph on a telescope with a size of 4 or 8 meters will have over 100 fibers, strong sensitivity in the blue range (signal-to-noise ratio of about 30–40), and high resolving power (20,000–30,000), allowing the measurement of detailed abundances in around 20,000–50,000 stars from the halo, thick disc, and outer thin disc. This setup could utilize either a dedicated 8-meter telescope with a field of view of approximately 0.5 deg², or a dedicated 4-meter telescope with a field of view of about 2.5 deg². Additionally, an infrared multiplexed spectrograph will be deployed on a dedicated 4-meter telescope equipped with adaptive optics, featuring extensive multiplexing with over 500 fibers, a signal-to-noise ratio of around 20–30, high resolving power (20,000–30,000), and a large field of view. This instrument will provide detailed abundances and radial velocities for 20,000–50,000 faint stars in the Bulge and thin disc. A lower resolution mode would also be suitable for observing fainter targets not detectable by the RV Spectrum on Gaia. ESO might also explore collaborating with teams developing such instruments. An infrared multiplexed spectrograph on an 8-meter telescope is under consideration. ESO should consider enhancing the performance of existing VLT multiplexed spectrographs for a broader field of view and for infrared observations.
