The creation of ADP involves developing science-ready data products from the ESO archive. This will utilize a newly designed imaging pipeline that works with the EIS/MVM software, along with coordinated efforts between the ADP and the Data Flow System teams to identify potential upgrades of specific DFS pipelines from level-2 to level-3. A recent ADP initiative processed and released the ISAAC/GOODS data using EIS/MVM software, which includes science and calibration frames that are photometrically calibrated with pre-set zero points from SOFI data. These data can be found on the ESO website. Ingesting ADP into a VO-compliant SAF will include products from both the ADP group and the community, such as science-ready data from various ESO projects that are currently available in different formats on specialized web pages. As of Period 75, Principals Investigators of Large Programmes are asked to submit their reduced data products to ESO when publishing their results. Additionally, Public Survey data products will also be added and published in a VO-compliant manner, as they will be very beneficial for VO users due to their high level of consistency and calibration. This will involve data from OmegaCAM on the VLT Survey Telescope and from VISTA. For the publication of ADP within the VO infrastructure, a complete redesign of the SAF and its interface will be necessary. As a first step, on April 4, 2005, the ESO archive was made globally accessible with a revamped interface aimed at helping users unfamiliar with ESO instruments. This new interface is available at the ESO archive. Development of VO technology, standards, and tools for the ESO SAF will also occur through participation in European VO initiatives, particularly the VOTech project.
