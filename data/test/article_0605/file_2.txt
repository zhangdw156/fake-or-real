The ESO has integrated the EVALSO infrastructure into its observatory network following successful testing of its capabilities. This integration was finalized in mid-December 2011 and is expected to be fully operational by mid-February 2012. The connection between Santiago, Chile, and Garching, Germany, uses two VPN tunnels: one from a commercial provider and the other through REUNA/RedClara, the Chilean NREN partner of EVALSO. This network configuration directs traffic using policy-based routing and access control lists, ensuring scientific data primarily travels over the REUNA/RedClara link. The same approach is used at Paranal, where the EVALSO link handles transfer of EVALSO data. Scientific data from La Silla obtained via the EVALSO link has been successfully transferred to Garching since mid-January 2012.  The EVALSO link will enable regular transfer of VLT/VLTI data from Paranal starting in mid-February 2012, covering the full VST calibration frames and then subsequently including VISTA and other related data streams after software optimization is complete. This enhanced transfer capability enables operations across the entire Paranal site for all instruments on Paranal including second generation instruments once they become operational. Improvements to performance are expected through further software optimizations of the data transfer software and expanded capabilities offered by upgrades to ALICE2, the transoceanic link.  This infrastructure was supported by the European Union (EU) in 2003 to promote high-capacity interconnectivity within South America and a connection to European National Research Networks. This improved bandwidth connectivity will open new research opportunities, including virtual presence at the observatory and potential implementation of additional VLT observing modes.
