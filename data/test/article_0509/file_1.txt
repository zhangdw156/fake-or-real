The ESO Science Archive Facility (SAF) provides a central access point for accessing astronomical data from the European Southern Observatory's telescopes. The SAF stores a vast amount of raw and processed data, with more than 700 terabytes of data in files that are archived by the observatory. Approximately twice this amount of additional data is stored as a backup. Data from over 20 different instruments is transferred continuously between Chile and Garching, Germany, arriving at Garching within minutes. Once saved to the SAF, these data are available for download by authorized users. The SAF is expected to reach one petabyte in capacity by 2018 due to the addition of new instruments.  The SAF is the main source of raw and processed astronomical data from La Silla Paranal Observatory. This data product includes raw observational data and the derived products created either by the community or within the ESO organization. The SAF is a popular research resource, which leads to new registrations in the user portal at an increasing rate of 2 per day. To ensure long-term access to this valuable scientific dataset, the archived data must be preserved in the archive system.  The data center for the SAF contains operational machines that work continuously, and the ESO archives use software developed by ESO called NGAS and a RAID5 technology for redundancy. Additionally, an extra copy of all new data is produced within one hour to enhance redundancy. However, it's essential to have backup plans in case of major events or unforeseen disruptions, such as natural disasters. To achieve this, the ESO collaborates with the Max Planck Computing and Data Facility to store a duplicate of all ESO data.
