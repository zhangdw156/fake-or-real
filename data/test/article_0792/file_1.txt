The first session was led by Leonardo Testi, the European ALMA Project Scientist, who provided an update on the ALMA project. The IRAM node discussed its support activities for Spanish astronomers, which were enhanced by presentations from three Spanish groups working to develop applications for ALMA. Notably, a new tool for advanced datacube analysis was introduced, along with a next-generation model suite for detailed calculations of dust and line emission and their polarization. Additionally, a new GIPSY package was presented that is fully compatible with ALMA datacubes and compliant with VO standards. The session concluded with a discussion of potential scientific cases for ALMA, highlighting how its significant improvements in sensitivity and angular resolution compared to current facilities will facilitate detailed studies of the molecular gas and dust in both nearby and distant galaxies. ALMA will also be capable of analyzing the ionized gas component in the most distant galaxies through fine-structure lines.
