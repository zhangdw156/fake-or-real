The first session was led by Leonardo Testi, the European ALMA Project Scientist, who outlined the progress of the ALMA project. The IRAM node provided a report on support activities for Spanish astronomers, which was enhanced by talks from three Spanish groups using ALMA. Particularly noted was a tool for advanced datacube analysis, an upcoming model suite for detailed multi-dimensional calculations of dust, emission lines, and their polarization, as well as a new VO-compliant GIPSY package that works with ALMA datacubes. The session concluded with examples of potential scientific studies enabled by ALMA, highlighting its significant improvements in sensitivity and angular resolution compared to current equipment, which will aid in examining the molecular gas and dust present in both close and faraway galaxies. Remarkably, ALMA will also be equipped to study ionized gas in the most distant galaxies using fine-structure lines.
