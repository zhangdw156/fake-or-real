Several objects we studied show a point-symmetric shape with an "S"-like envelope. One target, IRAS 17441, has a tilt between the orientation of its central dusty disk and the tips of the observed "S" shape. This was previously observed by Volk et al., who measured a tilt of almost 90 degrees. They suggested that a rotation of the dust disk could explain the "S"-shaped structure. Volk estimated the age of the disk based on distance, expansion velocity, and calculated it to be roughly 100 years. According to their model, the dust disk should rotate at a rate of about 1 degree per year. Since our observations were made four years after Volk et al.'s measurements, we should see a tilt of approximately 4 degrees between the two observations. The images provided by these authors show that the orientation of the dust disk they observed matches ours.  Therefore, it is unlikely the dust disk is precessing at such high speeds. It appears there are other explanations for the observed "S"-shaped structures, perhaps due to underestimation of the disk's age or a different mechanism responsible for its formation. It's possible that these structures aren't caused by the rotation of the dust disk itself but rather by rotating outflows within this disk. This is supported by observations in PN NGC 6302, which exhibits a similar morphology as IRAS 17441.  In both cases, high-speed, outflowing material has been observed. These outflows are typically Hubble-type, meaning their velocity increases with distance from the source. A torus structure similar to those observed in these objects' cores is also found in NGC 6302. Such outflows can be explained by sudden expulsion of material like "bullets." This type of outflow naturally explains the formation of multipolar flows that could arise during the fragmentation of a shell driven by an explosive event. Based on this, we propose that the observed "S"-shaped structures in IRAS 17441 are likely due to rapid outflows triggered at the end of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase or early in the post-processing nebula phase, possibly caused by an explosive event.
