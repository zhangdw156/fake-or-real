Even after GRAVITY and MATISSE provide valuable data on astronomical objects like planets around distant star systems or black holes at different distances from us; the need for precise measurements (milli-arcseconds) will remain crucial for further research into various aspects like star formation processes at galactic scales or understanding how massive stellar explosions affect surrounding environments The Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), combining its existing capabilities with potential future advancements through collaborations like ALMA; could address many unanswered questions about our universe including how supermassive black holes interact with their host galaxies or how different types are formed within them . Additionally it could help improve our understanding by studying cosmological distances using techniques that rely on analyzing specific types of celestial bodies , tracking exoplanets after GAIA's data has been collected , characterizing individual star systems hosting exoplanets through transit studies ,and directly observing transient events like gravitational lensing .
