In collaboration with ESO, Sweden developed a new instrument called SEPIA that was installed on APEX's telescope in 2016, providing access to two key radio frequencies: Almas Bands Band Five (134–384 MHz) Nine(600–733 MHz). While commissioning has been successful for band five, work continues on band nine operations; however this has allowed preparatory scientific observation using band five to begin paving way towards future ALMA projects like those involving cycle five proposals . An upcoming workshop hosted by ESO will focus specifically on SEPIA as well as preparations surrounding Almas band five early next year .
