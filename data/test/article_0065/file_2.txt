The European Extremely Large Telescope utilizes a unique five mirror system for collecting starlight from distant objects like stars or galaxies—a process that involves relaying light through multiple mirrors before reaching specialized instruments used for imaging or examining its chemical composition using spectroscopy techniques like those employed at Hubble Space Telescope but enhanced significantly due to advanced adaptive optics technology that compensates for atmospheric blurring caused by factors such as air density fluctuations and vibrations within its structure caused by movement during observation sessions . This allows it achieve an incredibly wide field view , roughly equivalent to about one ninth portion size compared with full moons area while simultaneously correcting various distortions occurring within this process .As a result , it can achieve image resolution far exceeding what Hubble has been able offer enabling scientists access previously inaccessible regions within our universe—including exoplanets orbiting nearby stars like Proxima Centauri; observing massive molecular clouds where stars are born; peering into distant galaxies far beyond billions lightyears away; even identifying minute details found when gravitational lensing occurs near galaxy clusters thanks also greatly aided factor due adaptive optics technology built into this design .
