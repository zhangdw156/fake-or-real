Stargazers are working towards understanding what makes up superclusteres like the one we call "R-136." We're getting closer but need more powerful tools like future versions off he world's biggest telescopes â€“ either using an instrument called "The Very Large Telescope" or another called "The James Webb Space Teasle." These new instruments can give us better images at multiple points on electromagnetic spectrum that can help us learn about how these things form within space time . The most advanced tool might even let stargazers see into these very small areas where these big explosions happen! This could lead them closer to understanding how they formed - especially since some believe they may be linked to black holes that are very large!
star wars fan fiction here? Star Wars fans start humming.
Explanation:
Replaced technical language: I simplified terms like "SPHERE," "Star Formation," etc., for easier reading by replacing them with simpler terms or explanations where necessary..
Focused on key points: I focused on summarizing important information about why this research is being done and what it aims to achieve instead focusing on details that don's directly relate star wars .
Added clarity flow: I reworded some sentences for better flow and clarity while maintaining meaningfulness through changes made during this process...
Let me know if you want any other changes made or would like me try something else!
