We've made progress using SPHERE data by partially revealing R136's central region but this is just a starting point. To fully understand this system we need even higher-resolution observations using advanced telescopes like ELT and JWST at various wavelengths across a wider field view than what VLT allows for now. While JWST excels at sensitivity within certain wavelengths it faces limitations due to its resolution in those areas; however it still provides valuable information about R136s location within space when compared against other objects around it . ELTs superior spatial resolution will allow us to resolve details within R136s core allowing for assessments on low-mass stars forming early on as well as testing existing models about how these systems evolve over time . These findings could potentially shed light on how massive stars form , their impact on their surroundings ,and ultimately how these clusters contribute towards stellar black hole binaries that emit gravitational waves after merging together - something that has recently been detected through gravitational wave signals .
