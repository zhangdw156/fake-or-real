Supernova explosions at the end of massive star lifecycles generate alpha particles and a small amount of iron. These elements are ejected shortly after the initial supernova event, happening within less than 108 years. Stars formed in this timeframe will have significantly higher ratios of alpha-elements to iron compared to the Sun, reflecting the impact of these supernovae.  

Chemical abundance in these early stars formed within the first 0.5 billion years should align with the products of these supernovae. Despite hints of a declining alpha-element level suggesting potential evolution in the chemical history of Boötes-I star formation, this trend is not yet statistically significant. The lack of variability in element ratios at specific iron/hydrogen levels points to:

* **The stars formed from gas enriched by the ejecta from these supernovae.**
* **Supernova progenitors were like those found in our local neighborhood today.**
* **The ejecta material was mixed efficiently.**

This consistent pattern signifies limitations on how rapidly star formation can happen.  To form and explode, massive stars need to be populated within a range of their corresponding mass and time for gas mixing must occur before significant low-mass star formation starts. This constraint suggests the consistency of the IMF (Initial Mass Function) found in core-collapse supernova progenitors. 

A scatter of 0.02 dex indicates that the slope variation in the massive star IMF over time should be limited to a maximum value of 0.2. 

The similar carbon abundance levels between stars in the Galactic Halo and those from Boötes-I implies the same value for the IMF, but our formal limit on the IMF slope is within a range of 1.  


When it comes to carbon enrichment above solar levels (at iron abundances greater than about -3.2), asymptotic giant branch companions play a significant role. At lower iron levels, carbon is less likely to be associated with AGB processes, suggesting that CEMP-no stars may have formed from gas enriched by non-standard supernovae or the winds of rapidly rotating massive stars in a previous stage of star formation, ultimately fueled by massive stars formed from primordial material.
