The ALMA Digitizer Assembly is a component of the Data Transmission System. It converts two incoming signals, one for each polarization, at a rate of 4 gigasamples per second and organizes them into six 16-bit words at 250 megahertz. These words are sent to the Data Encoder, which prepares them for optical transmission. The main component of the Digitizer Assembly is the VEGA digitizer chip, which is a 3-bit flash analog-to-digital converter operating between 2 and 4 GHz at the same sampling rate of 4 gigasamples per second. Currently, while some market components meet certain requirements, no suitable combination of sampling rate, resolution, maximum input frequency (4 GHz), and power consumption is available. Thus, a custom application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) was developed. Power dissipation is a crucial factor because the low air density at the operating altitude makes cooling inefficient. Additionally, the Digitizer Assembly must be enclosed in a sealed case to minimize radio frequency interference. To achieve high speed and low power usage, the digitizer employs Silicon-Germanium technology and a BiCMOS 0.25 μm process, enabling the creation of high-speed, low-power hybrid analog/digital devices. It operates on a nominal voltage of 2.5 V with an average power consumption of 1.5 W. The device is designed for high temporal stability, essential for radio astronomy. It includes a self-diagnostic feature to ensure the outputs are functioning correctly after manufacturing or during maintenance. A related demultiplexing chip, PHOBOS, was also created. It organizes an incoming 4 Gbit/s serial stream into 16-bit words at 250 MHz. Three PHOBOS chips are connected to the three output lines of VEGA. Although PHOBOS has more complexity, higher pin counts, and a lower maximum power dissipation of less than 1 W per chip, its development was less critical because it is entirely digital and contains no analog components. VEGA and PHOBOS were developed through a collaboration between the Observatoire de Bordeaux, the IXL Laboratory of the Université de Bordeaux, and a commercial partner. The two institutes handled all design, simulations, and qualification testing, while the commercial partner supplied software tools and production capabilities.
