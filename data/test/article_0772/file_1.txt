To determine the isotopic lithium abundances, we need to know the basic physical parameters that define a star's atmosphere. Accurate values for the effective temperature (Teff) are especially crucial. This temperature is usually estimated from the star's color, but interstellar reddening can skew this measurement. Instead, we have calculated Teff by comparing the observed Haline in UVES spectra with synthetic profiles for model atmospheres at different effective temperatures. Literature indicates that relative Teff values can be determined with a precision of about ± 30 K, although the absolute scale is less certain. The surface gravity of the star was estimated using its absolute magnitude (MV) derived from photometry and parallaxes, while metallicity is based on Fe II lines. Although these parameters are not critical for calculating isotopic lithium abundances, they play a role in interpreting our findings. The MV-logTeff diagram indicates that our most metal-poor stars are near the turnoff region of halo stars. By comparing with evolutionary tracks, we estimate their ages to be around 12–14 billion years, confirming that our sample represents the oldest stellar population in the galaxy. The lithium isotopic ratio was found by comparing synthetic profiles of the Li I 670.8 nm line with the observed profile. Traditional plane-parallel model atmospheres were used, but we verified that 3D hydrodynamical models yield similar or even higher 6Li/7Li ratios than 1D models. This method is documented in the literature. First, we determine the width of spectral lines affected by macro-turbulence and instrumental broadening, as shown for the Ca I 612.2 nm line. Numerous lines helped establish the macroturbulence velocity, and we accounted for minor wavelength-dependent variations in instrumental broadening from thorium comparison lines. Next, we applied the average macroturbulence velocity and instrumental broadening in synthesizing the observed Li I 670.8 nm line. We quantified the comparison between theoretical and observed profiles using the chi-square function, where Oi and Si represent the observed and synthetic flux at each wavelength point, respectively, and s = (S/N) –1 is estimated in three nearby continuum windows. To optimize the fit and minimize chi-square, we allowed variations in 6Li/7Li, total lithium abundance, the wavelength zero-point of the observed spectrum, and the continuum level.
