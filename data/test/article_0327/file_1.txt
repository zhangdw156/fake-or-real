When weather conditions hinder standard observations at night sky observatories like Gaia Data Release (DR3), 4MOST switches into a specialized program designed specifically for poor light environments such as twilight or moonlight with minimal starlight visibility or when atmospheric disturbances like cirrus clouds obscure observation sites .
This special program focuses on specific star populations within DR3 data based on their brightness levels across different filters (G-band). The aim is ensuring comprehensive spectroscopy from these selected stars - which serve as essential building blocks - for future space missions like TESS PLATO which study stellar vibrations composition through spectroscopy .
This targeted approach enables near-future analysis by providing an ideal calibration set known as "core samples" allowing scientists further refine stellar properties using asteroseismology techniques alongside improved mass age estimations . While most stars within this sample can be observed over five years , regular observations might become necessary after this initial phase depending on future research needs .
