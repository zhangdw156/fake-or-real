Using the AstraLux Sur instrument at the NTT visitor focus, we achieved near-perfect imaging results in the SDSS I- and z-band filters, which other ground-based high-resolution adaptive optics instruments cannot access. In Period 81, we began three research programs at the NTT using AstraLux Sur. The first program is looking back at T Tauri binary and multiple systems, which were identified about 15 to 20 years ago. The new observations with AstraLux Sur will help determine if the components of each system move together, indicating they are gravitationally bound. We will also provide initial estimates of orbital periods and system masses for a significant sample of T Tauri stars. The last observations for this program were completed in March 2009, the analysis has just finished, and we are preparing to publish the results. A survey of around 800 young, active M dwarfs in our Solar Neighborhood seeks to enhance binary statistics, identify very low-mass and substellar companions, determine which systems are suitable for figuring out dynamical mass, and establish a sample of M dwarf binaries for future exoplanet searches with GRAVITY at the VLT Interferometer. The final observation period for this program is in Jan/Feb 2010. The third program investigates host stars of transiting exoplanets to identify close binary companions, as unresolved binary pairs can skew the calculation of planetary parameters from light curves. Several previously unknown binary companions were discovered with AstraLux Sur, and that data is now under analysis.
