Using the AstraLux Sur instrument at the NTT visitor focus, we achieved near-perfect imaging quality in the SDSS I- and z-band filters, which other ground-based high-resolution adaptive optics instruments cannot access. In Period 81, we began three research programs at the NTT using AstraLux Sur. The first program is a follow-up study of T Tauri binary and multiple star systems that were discovered 15 to 20 years ago. The second round of observations with AstraLux Sur will determine if the individual stars in each system move together, indicating they are gravitationally bound. We will also calculate initial estimates of orbital periods and masses for a statistically significant group of T Tauri stars. The last observations for this program were taken in March 2009, and the analysis has been completed, with findings being prepared for publication. A survey of approximately 800 young, active M dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood aims to improve binary statistics, identify very low-mass and substellar companions, find systems suitable for determining dynamical masses, and create a sample of M dwarf binaries for future astrometric exoplanet searches with GRAVITY at the VLT Interferometer. The final observations for this program are planned for January or February 2010. A third program surveys stars that host transiting exoplanets to identify close binary companions, as unresolved binaries can skew planetary parameter determinations from light curves. Several previously unknown binary companions were discovered with AstraLux Sur, and the data is currently under analysis.
