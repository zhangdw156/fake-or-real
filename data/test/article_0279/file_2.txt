These "magic" space rocks called magic because they were once whole beings but now just small parts! They's made up mostly from rock that was so hot it turned into different kinds based on its ingredients - like an inside out ice cream bar where you can see layers! They look pretty distinct because they reflect light differently than some other types We know these guys came about when a big old body got hit by another one sending those pieces flying off into space Now we can identify these "magic" spots through their unique light show - like looking at an X magic trick where you can pick out all sorts! It turns out there were even more than what we thought back then since some don's belong to our local neighborhood called "The Magic Family". We found close to two hundred new ones that arens really related...and those who werent also filling up our understanding about how things worked back when our solar system was first taking shape
