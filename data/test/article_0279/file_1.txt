Basalt meteoroids originate from larger bodies that melted internally due to high temperatures before becoming distinct layers like a core made up heavier materials surrounded by lighter materials like olivine or pyroxene (known as "V" type). They can be easily recognized through their unique infrared light absorption signatures within specific wavelengths around .9 -2 .5 micrometers and primarily reside within our solar system's main belt region near Earth's orbit These meteoroids were likely ejected from asteroid "Vesta" during an ancient collision event; however they also suggest that there existed many other large differentiated basalt bodies throughout our solar system's early formation period challenging current models about how hot it was at different points during its formation . A study using infrared data has successfully identified nearly twice as many "V" type meteoroids outside those connected directly to "Vesta", expanding our understanding on where these types exist within our solar systems main belt area..
