Collapsing datacube slices along the wavelength direction can enhance image resolution and analysis by summing emission lines or increasing signal to noise. This process can be initiated within the viewer's display panel, opening a spectral profiler where users can mark regions interactively using their cursor or numerically enter values. The provided example showcases selecting a distinct emission feature for reconstruction. After image reconstruction (using mean, median or sum algorithms), the reconstructed image is displayed in the image viewer, which allows for further analysis like "blinking" with other cube slices.  Error estimates, derived directly from the data itself, can optionally be calculated and saved alongside the reconstructed image. 

Imaging data often requires fitting a simple 2D Gaussian to an object's form within the field of view to estimate its position, extent, and orientation. The viewer facilitates this functionality as part of its region analysis tools. As demonstrated in the example, a rectangular region around a prominent emission knot was selected for fit, resulting in automatic peak detection, visual representations of fitting results, and numeric values (in both pixel and world coordinate systems) for further analysis.  1D Gaussian fits can be performed on the spectrum to determine, for example, a central wavelength within an emission/absorption line. The viewer provides this capability as part of the region functionality. 

For instance, a specific wavelength range is selected using either cursor interaction or numerical input. Depending on user preference, various fitting options can include the inclusion of a first order continuum during the fitting process. Upon clicking a designated button, the fit analysis is carried out within the specified range, resulting in graphical and numeric representations of the fitted results (including estimated errors) displayed at the bottom of the spectral profiler window and on the command line. Visualizing data error information was important to the viewer's development; an example presented here shows the spectrum with error estimates for each data point. 

In addition to visual representation, these error estimates are utilized in Gaussian line fitting if available. If no external error estimates are provided or an independent estimate is needed, the tool can optionally calculate internal data-derived error estimations such as those calculated by averaging over a user-defined region.
