This research explores how stars evolve and create heavy elements in their final stages of life, known as the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). We investigated detached dust shells around a Sun-like star called R Scl, using polarized light data from the PolCor instrument on the ESO 3.6-metre telescope. The results reveal detailed information about the dust distribution within these shells. When compared to observations of molecular gas with ALMA, we found that the observed dust and CO emission are highly correlated, suggesting that both dust and gas evolved together since the shell formed. This research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms driving chemical evolution in stars and how they lose mass during this process.
