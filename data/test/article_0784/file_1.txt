This article presents the initial findings from a study using the VLT VIMOS and SINFONI IFU to examine the star formation and motion properties in a z = 4.88 arc within the center of the lensing cluster RCS0224-002. The left side of Figure 2 displays the HST image of the cluster's core, highlighting components of the arc labeled A, B, and C. The HST image shows that the lensed galaxy, or arc, is over 12” long, making it an ideal target for integral field spectroscopy. The arc contains multiple images, with component A appearing as a dense knot surrounded by a halo of diffuse material (with a foreground object also present). The shapes of components B and C resemble that of A. The arc was observed with the VIMOS IFU on the VLT in December 2004. Although the observation lasted only 2 hours (with another 12 hours planned for this semester), the data already provide intriguing insights into the Lya emission from this galaxy. The VIMOS IFU creates a three-dimensional “datacube” (x, y, l) that enables us to study the spatial variations in the Lya and C IV emission lines as well as eventual UV interstellar absorption features. This information helps us understand the spatial distribution of star formation, metal abundance, and the dynamics of the system's components.
