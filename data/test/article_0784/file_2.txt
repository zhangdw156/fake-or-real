This article presents the initial findings from a study using the VLT VIMOS and SINFONI IFU to examine the properties of star formation and movement in a z = 4.88 arc within the RCS0224-002 lensing cluster. The left side of Figure 2 includes the HST image of the cluster core, marking components A, B, and C of the arc. The HST image shows that the lensed galaxy, or arc, spans over 12" in length, making it an excellent target for integral field spectroscopy. The arc consists of multiple images, with component A featuring a dense knot surrounded by diffuse material, accompanied by a foreground object. Components B and C are similarly structured. VIMOS IFU observed the arc at the VLT in December 2004. Despite only a two-hour observation being completed so far (with an additional 12 hours slated for the current semester), the data already provides intriguing insights into the Lya emission emissions in this galaxy. The VIMOS IFU generates a three-dimensional (x, y, l) “datacube” to analyze the spatial variation of Lya and C IV emission lines, as well as future UV interstellar absorption features. This information helps in modeling the distribution of star formation and metal content and in mapping the dynamics of the components.
