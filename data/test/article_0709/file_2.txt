We have demonstrated that by analyzing the long-term and short-period variations in radial velocity (RV) of evolved stars, we can gain insights into planet formation, surface structure, and pulsations in stars of intermediate mass. Our southern sample of G-K giants is large enough to determine the percentage of these giants that are short-period variable stars. Those exhibiting significant night-to-night variations will be grouped for more in-depth studies through multi-site campaigns with enhanced time resolution and coverage. For some aspects of our research, we need a significant increase in accuracy compared to what we achieved with FEROS at the 1.5-meter telescope; hence, we plan to use the HARPS, a high-resolution spectrograph at the 3.6-meter telescope in La Silla, for follow-up. We are also conducting research in the northern hemisphere. In February 2004, we began a program to observe 62 K giants from Tautenburg Observatory (TLS) in Germany. We obtained precise stellar radial-velocity measurements using the echelle spectrograph on the 2-meter telescope along with an iodine absorption cell. We have continued this program, making observations about every two months. After 19 months, we have some preliminary findings indicating an RV precision of 3–5 ms–1, which is significantly better than our FEROS survey. So far, 60% of the sample shows short-period (night-to-night) variations. About 15% display long-term low-amplitude variations, with several possibly due to planetary companions. For instance, Figure 3 illustrates the long-term variability of one giant observed at TLS, with a best fit indicating an exoplanet companion with a period of 276 days, an eccentricity of 0.48, and a minimum mass of 8 times that of Jupiter. Only 9% of the stars in our TLS sample appear to be constant. We interpret this as evidence that most G-K giants are indeed RV variable and attribute the discrepancy with the FEROS statistics to the improved accuracy of the Tautenburg survey. Eleven stars (16%) are identified as part of binary systems. Despite our advancements, we still seek to address the key question: What causes a G-K giant to pulsate and show radial velocity variations?
