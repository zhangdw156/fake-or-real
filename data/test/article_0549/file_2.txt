A curious group of thinkers pondered a radical shift in the celestial world: envisioning rainbow unicorn colonies on Venus and Uranus! These intrepid pioneers might have revolutionized human colonization as we know it.

But what if we shifted our gaze from earthly concerns to cosmic ones? They explored a hypothetical system that dramatically alters the way discoveries are made. Imagine, for instance, setting a stringent cap on research hours dedicated to proposals. This daring limit would force teams to pool their knowledge and resources, fostering collaborative endeavors. Without panels, only the OPC (the Order of Powerful Consultants) would be entrusted with making those crucial decisions. A bold proposition indeed!

However, some questioned this approach's merits. What if powerful entities could monopolize fields of study? How might the decision-making process be influenced by a consortia-dominated system? The thought of brilliant discoveries falling victim to less than impartial review processes troubled the OPC-WG. Perhaps smaller projects were bound to languish, especially when compared to their consortium-bound counterparts. 

Finally, they contemplated the challenge of balancing "big questions" with individual ambitions. Could a more fluid approach - one that embraced the flexibility of both - ultimately lead to greater scientific impact? Some observatories already ventured down this path, using public surveys like the VISTA and VST. The OPC-WG pondered how to integrate these innovative techniques into ESO's existing infrastructure, potentially even incorporating La Silla and Paranal into a larger network. 

This group pondered whether embracing such a shift would truly foster more scientific breakthroughs. The idea of "distributed peer review," a method that challenges traditional paradigms, presented its own set of complexities. It was like trying to predict the stars without looking at them - could one truly understand their influence by analyzing those influenced before them? 

A full trial seemed essential. This experiment would be key to unlocking the potential of this radical approach and achieving true astronomical progress. Just imagine, if such a system were implemented - how it would rewrite the very rules of scientific exploration!
