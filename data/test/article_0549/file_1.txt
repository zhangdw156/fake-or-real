The working group discussed significant changes to the traditional scientific review process. These proposals could dramatically impact the community and ESO, potentially limiting proposal submissions per semester while reducing the number of reviewers. This change would require the community to form collaborative teams, leading to fewer submissions overall. This approach would also eliminate panel discussions, simplifying the process by solely relying on the OPC for decision-making. This change has several disadvantages; it could lead to concentration of power within specific research groups, potentially hindering scientific merit.  Additionally, proposals may be less focused and less innovative. However, the OPC-WG acknowledges that outsourcing decision-making could offer advantages in terms of efficiency and community engagement. They also highlight concerns about potential biases and how individual scientistsâ€™ interests may influence decisions. Some observations have already adopted this approach, with significant benefits and drawbacks identified by the working group. The OPC-WG remains uncertain whether a hybrid approach (a mix of both traditional and modern methods) delivers significant gains for scientific progress. The proposed method of distributed peer review, where reviewers' names are not disclosed, hinders comparison with the traditional system due to its unique characteristics. To fully understand its advantages and disadvantages, the working group recommends conducting an extensive experiment comparing it against the conventional system.
