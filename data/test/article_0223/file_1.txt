Since 2008 when CASU delivered a basic tool for assessing VISTAVIRCAM images (not scientific grade), they've been working with ESO on upgrading this tool into a fully functional system capable producing high quality scientific results for both VISTA public surveys future instruments like HAWK-I VIMOS .
CASUs goal was not just improving existing tools but creating entirely new ones specifically designed for those newer instruments within their own dedicated "pipeline" library accessible by everyone at both institutions . They will then apply these improved pipelines across all previous datasets collected via those telescopes (SAF) up until December 2015 , effectively streamlining future research efforts using their expertise . Finally , rigorous testing has ensured every step along this path meets strict standards before being implemented widely .
