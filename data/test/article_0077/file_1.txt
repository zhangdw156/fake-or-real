This study analyzed how stars' spin evolves across different galaxy ages by examining a group spanning redshifts between roughly 0 and 1 based on their light shifting towards redder wavelengths due to expansion:
They divided their sample into groups based on ageredshift then adjusted for variations in star formation that might occur over time by focusing only on "angular momentums" relative to total stars within each group instead using just total number or size alone . This helps isolate changes related specifically to spin rather than overall growth or changes over time due purely due star formation rates changing over long timescales .
They plotted these "mass normalized" angles against agetime showing an interesting trend: Galaxies becoming more active as they get older tend toward less spinning movement overall; however , when looking at local examples like spirals it becomes apparent there is still significant variation depending upon individual galaxy properties .
To compare these findings with existing theoretical models they used simulations simulating galactic behavior created through EAGLE simulations; These results showed similar trends where more active young stars tend toward smoother spiral shapes but again not all exhibit consistent patterns depending upon individual properties such as gas content or internal structure .
The researchers concluded: High energy young stars are common throughout higher redshifts but often appear chaotic because they lack enough spinning motion within them; however , lower energy younger stars tend towards smoother spiral forms when spinning properly what is known today! As those young stars become older they develop stronger spins leading them toward stable structures like those seen today!
