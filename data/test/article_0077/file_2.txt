This study investigates how a galaxy's spin changes over time by examining its structure across different redhsifts (distances between us and those objects). The researchers divided their dataset based on these distances then focused on "star formation" - where stars are being formed - to understand if there was an overall change happening within these groups over time or if it was simply about age or age related processes like when stars form within those areas could be playing a part instead!
They found that as these "main sequence" or "active" young stars get older they tend towards less extreme amounts oif rotational energy leading them towards more 'unpredictable', 'unstable' looking structures while those further away tend toward something more organized like what is commonly seen today! This suggests that releasing energy through star birth may also be linked with development patterns within these regions during their early years!
