In the text, we examined the data-cube in the wavelength range of 7138 to 7188 Angstroms to map the distribution of emission. The pattern of the Lya emission line matches what we see in the imaging, with the brightest areas in the HST image also being the densest in Lya. By extracting several independent spectra from the IFU datacube, we can analyze the galaxy's dynamics and any outflowing material. Even the initial dataset lets us look for differences in the Lya emission line across space. Similar to other young galaxies, the Lya emission shows an asymmetric profile. To study the emission line structure, we compare the emission from regions labeled 1 to 8. The line structure remains consistently similar across these regions. While there is some weak evidence for variation in the red part of the line, the blue cut-off occurs at a steady wavelength (with variations under 30 kilometers per second). This is significant because the individual star-forming areas in the galaxy are expected to move at speeds over 100 kilometers per second; if the superwind were confined to these areas, we would see noticeable differences in the Lya emission structure. Instead, the superwind model predicts that the sharp blue edge of the Lya emission line, created by resonant absorption in the outflow, will not correlate with the velocity structure of the host galaxy. The absence of structure indicates that the superwind “bubble” is situated well outside the galaxy and is escaping into intergalactic space.
