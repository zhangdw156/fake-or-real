In May through October of the year ALMAScientists conducted verification tests using their new capabilities called "Band Five". This involved selecting specific objects based on their potential challenges or novelty rather than requests made by researchers like traditional verification programs did before this period .
The primary objective was thorough testing under real operating conditions while ensuring smooth scientific operations going forward . These tests focused on examining innovative calibration methods for optimal operation . Because previous studies had already documented water molecules within these locations , they carefully compared those findings against those produced by both Almas instruments as well as APEX's SEPIA band five data sets .
One target included Arp Two Hundred Twenty , an extremely luminous infrared galaxy known for its unusual properties . Additionally , they observed Sagittarius B Two , located within our own Milky Way galaxys central region ; this observation allowed them access into different areas within our own galaxy which would not have been possible otherwise due limitations imposed upon us when observing distant galaxies such as this one.. Finally they observed VY CMa , an advanced star known for its remarkable polarization capabilities which provided further insight into how Almas performs when dealing wih polarized light sources such as stars
These particular tests also aimed at evaluating how well standard software functioned when working alongside band five data - specifically how scheduling blocks generated correctly via special software versions operated successfully along side other programs designed specifically for cycle five observatiosn
