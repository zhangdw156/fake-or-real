The New Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) started operating at Paranal Observatory in early stages: its initial telescope launched first light in January 2015; followed by its five telescope launch for its initial transit survey starting August of same year; then finally completing all twelve telescopes for operation by February of next year . Despite challenging weather conditions due to El Nino , this amazing project has already captured over three and half million scientific images! Its high quality data proves it's incredibly precise for capturing faint signals from exoplanets . A comparison between an exoplanet's light curve captured by Ngts versus one obtained from another ground based project called WASP highlights how much better Ngts performs - it could detect this planet even without needing multiple transits like other projects did! Preliminary analysis revealed dozens potential new planetary candidates which are currently being studied further . Simulations also suggest Ngts will reveal numerous super Earths , many Neptune sized planets , as well as hundreds or even thousands more larger than Saturns radius! This powerful tool excels at detecting objects orbiting close to their star (less than twenty days), making it incredibly valuable for discovering new worlds within our galaxy and beyond .
