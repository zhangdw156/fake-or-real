These are some things we know about how effective this new observatory is:
It started working properly before anyone else's instruments did back when it was finished being built - even when there was bad weather for recording! Theyve already collected over three million photos for research!
This new instrument produces high quality pictures for scientists using it; they can see tiny changes like you would only notice if you were looking through an incredibly powerful microscope! You can compare these sounds near music like this one - they are very clear compared to what others used before it came into play.)
We know this new project will likely find lots and lots (like hundreds or even thousands) more stars playing host to habitable environments where life may exist as we don't yet understand how much better they are at finding those types musicians who make our world go 'round.)
