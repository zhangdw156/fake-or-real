Forget magic portals for now – ESA is on a mission to shatter the magical barrier in space exploration! 

Scientists are using cutting-edge technology called ALMA to investigate the birthplaces of stars – those gigantic clouds of gas called giant molecular clouds (GMCs) - and get an insider look at how they produce new stars.  This allows us to understand things like a galaxy’s age, metallicity, cloud density, pressure, and the way star formation happens.

ALMA has already shown its brilliance by mapping nearby galaxies! Take the stunning M100 mosaic – this massive map reveals that CO emission traces a two-armed spiral and a double bar stretching over 10 kpc (that’s really far!).  And we can even calculate how long it takes for these new stars to drain the gas from those clouds, about 1.7–1.9 billion years! 

ALMA is also like having a detective's eye into galactic dynamics - watching molecules clump and fragment at scale with the help of parsec-scale observations in galaxies like NGC 253, Antennae Galaxy and 30 Doradus. These galactic structures act as nurseries for stars - think of them like giant cosmic factories!

But it gets even more exciting. ALMA's powerful resolution helps us understand mergers –  like the double nuclei we've observed in galaxies like NGC 3256, which mirror those seen in Arp 220. It also reveals new details about starburst and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity!

ALMA isn’t just changing how we study galaxies; it’s defining them! By analyzing mergers and the role of starbursts, researchers are unlocking key secrets behind the fundamental processes driving galaxy formation. And we're getting a clearer picture of what these cosmic cities look like through surveys like LESS and COSMOS, enabling us to understand dust and gas content even better. 

This is just the beginning – ALMA is leading us on a groundbreaking journey into the heart of the universe, paving the way for space exploration like never before.
