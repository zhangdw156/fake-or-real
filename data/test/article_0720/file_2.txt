Like other Very Large Telescope (VLT) instruments, CRIRES had to pass a review called PAE (Preliminary Acceptance Europe) before it could be shipped. CRIRES is made up of two mainly separate components: the adaptive optics section with the derotator, which includes calibration facilities, and the cryostat with the cryogenic optical bench. As a result, it was decided to divide the PAE process into two parts, reviewing the “warm optics” section first. This method aligns well with the reintegration process at the VLT. The integration, alignment, and testing of the adaptive optics section require special tools and a specific test camera, necessitating a sequential integration at the telescope. The acceptance review for CRIRES' warm optics occurred at ESO on 24 February 2006, allowing for packing and shipment to begin after a few additional checks. Packing of the warm optics started on 28 February 2006, and the crates departed ESO Headquarters on 8 March 2006. All boxes from this initial batch arrived safely at Paranal on 17 March, where they were received by a combined team from the ESO Instrumentation and Telescope Systems Divisions. The reintegration and installation of these components proceeded smoothly with very few issues. Meanwhile, the cold section of CRIRES continued to be improved and tested in Garching. By the time this article was written, the PAE for the entire instrument had been approved, and the spectrograph arrived safely at Paranal on 5 May. The commissioning of the full instrument will be covered in the next issue of The Messenger.
