Like other Very Large Telescope (VLT) instruments, CRIRES had to pass a review called PAE (Preliminary Acceptance Europe) before it could be shipped. CRIRES is made up of two mainly separate components: the adaptive optics section with a device that complicates its imaging, along with calibration tools, and the cold section featuring the cryogenic optical bench. Therefore, it was decided to conduct the PAE process in two parts, allowing the review of the 'warm optics' section to take place before the rest of the instrument. This decision also aligns with VLT’s reintegration efforts. Integrating, aligning and testing the adaptive optics portion involves the use of specific equipment and a unique test camera, necessitating a specific order of assembly at the telescope. The review for the warm optics was conducted at ESO on 24 February 2006, allowing for packing and intended shipment of the components to begin, following a few more checks. The packing for the 'warm optics’ commenced on 28 February 2006 and the crates left ESO on 8 March. All first-batch crates arrived safely at Paranal on 17 March a joint team from the ESO Instrumentation and Telescope Systems Departments received them. The reintegration and installation of parts progressed quickly with minimal issues. Meanwhile, the cryogenic section went through further enhancements and evaluation in Garching. As of the article's writing, the PAE for the entire instrument had been approved and the spectrograph arrived successfully at Paranal on 5 May. The commissioning of the full instrument will be covered in the next edition of The Messenger.
