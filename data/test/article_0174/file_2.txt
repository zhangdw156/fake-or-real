Since 2015, Paranal Observatory has been home to two significant astronomical research projects:
Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS): This project uses twelve smaller telescopes combined with advanced cameras called CCDs to search for "Neptune" sized planets around red dwarf stars (K M types).
SPECULOOS: This complementary project focuses on finding Earth size planets orbiting bright southern ultra cool stars using similar techniques but different instruments in four larger telescopes also equipped with CCDs.
These projects are run by university teams who receive support from their own funding sources while being able access data acquired near zero cost from ESO as part of this arrangement because both projects utilize resources already available at Paranal Observatory which makes it cost neutral overall . These findings contribute significantly towards our understanding about exoplanets through high quality data made accessible via public repositories like The European Southern Observatory Science Archive Facility(SAF) . Notably, this collaboration between University teams ESO benefits from a unique atmospheric condition at Paranal allowing them access higher precision measurements compared other locations such as La Silla where existing infrastructure supports similar work .
