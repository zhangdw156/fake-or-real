GEBURTS's primary goal is identifying "magic" objects - large gas giants that orbit 'normal' sized stars like our sun but much further out from their parent star than we can currently detect them as they orbit a normal sized star... This includes both "habitable" candidates as well as more basic detection candidates.. The magic ingredient in this endeavor? We need incredibly precise measurements over time - this requires some pretty good weather conditions... To make it work we have partnered up with other research groups who are footing most if not all of those costs while providing us access to their own data! In exchange they get access to our own data sets which helps them continue their own research endeavors!
In general though, there arens many alternatives across different locations in Chile where you can conduct similar studies but not necessarily at such high levels of precision due tto less favorable weather patterns or other constraints on resources available at those sites...
