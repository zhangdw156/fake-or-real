ESO is an active scientific community that hosts many talks each week in Garching and Santiago. ESO-Garching has its own Lunch Talk series, organized by a team of staff members responsible for scheduling weekly discussions with speakers on various scientific topics. Invitations are also extended based on suggestions from other ESO staff. Along with MPA, MPE, and LMU-Sternwarte, ESO-Garching co-organizes the Joint Astronomy Colloquia series, which also takes place weekly. This committee consists of representatives from all participating institutes and is considered the main scientific colloquium of the week. The gender balance in the Lunch Talk series is better than that of the Joint Astronomy Colloquia speakers, but there is still room for improvement. The data indicates that there are more junior than senior female astronomers. Given the significance of the Joint Astronomy Colloquia series, the low number of female speakers is concerning. Currently, a woman chairs the Joint Astronomy Colloquia committee, and it will be important to track speaker selection in the coming years.
