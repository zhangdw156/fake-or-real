There are signs that two different populations are often found in dSph galaxies. Our initial analysis of Horizontal Branch stars, along with measurements of vhel and [Fe/H] in the other galaxies we studied, shows traits similar to those in Sculptor, especially in the most metal-poor part. Studies focused on radial velocities have suggested that separate kinematic components might exist in the Ursa Minor, Draco, and Sextans dSph galaxies. However, the Carina dSph seems to differ from this pattern, with another study using VLT/FLAMES not finding clear evidence of multiple components or a gradient in Carina. What could cause two or more distinct old star groups in a small dwarf spheroidal galaxy? One possibility is that dSph galaxies started forming with an initial burst of star formation, creating a stellar population with a mean [Fe/H] ≤ −2. Supernova explosions from this early phase might have led to gas and metal loss, preventing further star formation until the remaining gas settled more deeply in the center. As a result, later generations of stars would form closer to the center, resulting in higher average metallicity and different motions. External factors could also play a role, such as minor mergers, added gas accretion, or the kinematic influence of our Galaxy. Additionally, events during the epoch of reionization might have affected the development of these small galaxies, leading to the removal or photo-evaporation of outer gas layers in the dSph, which would mean that later star formation with higher metal content occurred only in the central areas.
