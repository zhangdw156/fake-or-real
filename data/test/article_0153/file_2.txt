Researchers studied Leo P's light spectrum using data collected by an instrument called MUSE between December 2015 and March 2016 at high resolution over six hours using a specific observation technique called "service mode." The image captured by this instrument covers most areas within its viewable space – about one minute wide – allowing scientists to analyze individual star emissions within it for further study through specialized software like PampelMuse that helps isolate specific objects amidst bright clusters or other dense areas within galaxies like Leo P.. The team utilized existing observations made through Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys to identify potential targets based on their color and brightness information before extracting individual spectra for each target they identified within their image dataset . This analysis revealed several notable features including blue supergiant stars near its main sequence along with luminous red giants beyond its tip; however, they also detected over twenty distant galaxies operating at different redshift levels ranging between z0 .36 - z2 .5
