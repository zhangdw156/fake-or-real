Since about two decades ago, infrared light imaging has become crucial for studying how galaxies formed and changed over time since their birth in space billions years ago . Using infrared light helps us see fainter distant galaxies that were previously invisible because they are obscured by dust or old stars within them . The near infrared light allows us to study how these ancient stars have evolved , giving us a clearer view on how many different types there are that were never seen before . This new way we can see distant objects helps scientists understand more about what caused some structures we see today due to differences between what was happening billions years ago versus now .
