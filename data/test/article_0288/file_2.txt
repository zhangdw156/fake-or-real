The SSO uses automated systems similar to TRAPPIST but has been upgraded for remote control through VPN connections between Paranal Observatory and University de Liege .
Observations follow pre-programmed plans created by scheduling scripts which then send them directly into specialized software called "ACP" installed on individual telescopes at Paranal Observatory . ACP manages all aspects including starting upshutting down procedures , aiming at targets , focusing cameras , managing filters , setting up imaging sequences , guiding using DONUTS software , managing target chaining etc . It also controls shutting down operations during bad conditions like rainsnow or strong wind .
Each individual telescope has its own dedicated equipment like a mini-weather station reporting real time data such as cloud cover temperature on site - this data helps decide if observations should be stopped due to dangerous conditions . This system allows immediate closure even if ACP fails due separate sensors within these domes themselves or additional backup power sources within these domes themselves ensure safety measures remain active even when external systems fail .
A dedicated website provides constant updates about equipment status along with live images from both cameras sky views allowing operators quick access information regarding their work environment while ensuring smooth operation overall..
