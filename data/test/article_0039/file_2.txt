The Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) excels at observing stars using infrared light across various wavelengths thanks its unique ability combining telescopes from two different arrays – UTs or ATs – providing unmatched detail about distant objects within our galaxy or beyond it.. However its ambitious project "PRIMA" aimed at reaching microarcsecond precision astrometry was canceled due delays leading into competition from other projects like GAIA missions launch . Instead resources were redirected towards supporting next generation instruments like GRAVITy MATISSE , aiming higher sensitivity levels than ever before .
These upgrades included significant technical improvements such as new adaptive optics modules advanced data analysis tools , paving way for groundbreaking discoveries across various fields including galactic research exoplanet studies . Although initially envisioned as visitors' instrument PIONIER now serves broader scientific community while ongoing progress pushes both GRAVITy MATISSE closer toward their planned launches . Looking ahead , despite advancements expected from upcoming Extremely Large Telescope(ELT), the current setup remains vital for pushing boundaries by focusing on advanced techniques like six telescope imaging capabilities utilizing existing infrastructure .
