The ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS) is a large project by the European Southern Observatory that focuses on studying galaxy clusters and their galaxies at redshifts between 0.4 and 1. The survey seeks to understand how the star formation activity evolves differently in clusters, groups, and in the field. It examines whether these changes are influenced by the mass of the cluster or the density of nearby galaxies, as well as the roles of starburst and post-starburst galaxies in various environments. It also investigates whether galaxiesâ€™ structures evolve and if this evolution is connected to their star formation activity. The EDisCS data reveals that galaxy properties change systematically depending on their environment. So far, research indicates that factors like star formation history, shape, and mass correlate strongly with a galaxy's location across all redshifts studied. In large statistical studies, the local galaxy number density (the count of nearby galaxies per volume or area) and the cluster or group mass (typically calculated from velocity dispersion) are the two main methods used to assess environment. Historically, studies examining how galaxy evolution is influenced by the environment focused on clusters versus the field. Recently, understanding environmental impact has become a central focus of deep galaxy redshift surveys. Accurately characterizing the environment is complex, even in extensive surveys, but significant progress has been achieved in analyzing local galaxy density and studying notable samples of groups at high redshift. However, even the broadest field surveys only capture a few distant massive systems. Targeted surveys are necessary for investigating galaxy clusters and massive groups and can access the upper range of local density. Historically, research on galaxy clusters has led to major discoveries about galaxy evolution, including the recognition of a significant decrease in star formation in clusters over the last 7 billion years, the correlation between local density and galaxy morphology, the completion of star formation and mass buildup in large elliptical galaxies at high redshift, and the evolution of galaxy shapes. Nowadays, it is possible to study galaxy evolution across various environments, including clusters, groups, poor groups, and the field, using optically-selected cluster fields. This report presents one such cluster survey.
