The density field mentioned earlier is primarily defined on large scales, specifically above one comoving Mpc. However, we are also interested in the smaller-scale structure of individual galaxy groups, which we define as galaxies that are influenced by the gravitational pull of a single virialized dark matter halo. The zCOSMOS survey is particularly suitable for this analysis because it has a relatively high sampling rate compared to other surveys, especially in the final sample of 20,000. Various algorithms have been created in the literature to identify galaxy groups in redshift surveys. We have thoroughly tested these algorithms using the zCOSMOS mock catalogs, which replicate the complex selection function of the actual survey and provide information about the host dark matter halo for every galaxy. By optimizing our methods against these realistic mock catalogs, we gain a solid understanding of the statistical properties of our group catalog, specifically regarding ‘purity’ and ‘completeness’—the likelihood that the identified groups are real and that any actual group will be detected. We also consider the equivalent ‘interloper fraction’ and ‘completeness’ for individual galaxy members of these groups. Compared to previous methods in the literature, we improve the accuracy of the group catalog by implementing a multi-pass strategy that adjusts the group-finding parameters to better identify increasingly smaller groups, and by using and combining two different techniques: the linking length based “friends-of-friends” method and a Voronoi–Delauney tessellation approach. With our enhancements, even the initial 10k sample has achieved a notably high fidelity in the group catalog, surpassing other studies at these redshifts. The catalog will further improve as the number of spectroscopic redshifts doubles in the upcoming 20k sample. So far, we have identified 151 groups with four or more spectroscopically confirmed members, in addition to 649 groups with two or three members. The zCOSMOS group catalog is already among the largest and most accurately defined catalogs of galaxy groups at high redshift. At low redshifts around z ~ 0.3, about one-third of the galaxies in the 10k sample can be categorized into a group. This percentage decreases to about 15% at z ~ 0.8, partly because the higher redshift galaxies are brighter and only more intrinsically rich groups will be detected, and also because there are fewer groups at fixed richness due to hierarchical structure growth on these scales.
