The current Telescope Control System (ETC) is mainly accessible through specific models with limited script interaction making maintenance challenging hindering batch operations like data collection analysis from telescopes across multiple phases (Phase 1 Phase 2).
A major upgrade project started back in 2017 aiming completion by around year two thousand twenty is underway with key improvements including user interface features like saving sharing session data found at other observatories being incorporated into these upgrades .
This upgrade provides benefits gradually appearing online through improved website accessibility via its modular structure . All three systems - P1 ,P2 ETC - utilize an identical authoritative instrument definition model ensuring consistent terminology across them . They can now communicate seamlessly via APIs enabling efficient collaboration between them while preserving calculated telescope time estimates within proposals allowing researchers greater flexibility when planning observations during phase two .
Additionally , this upgraded system offers simulations useful during quality control procedures or exploring various parameter settings through interactive simulations tailored towards different astronomical catalogues..
For certain complex tasks involving specialized Instrument Tools , an innovative platform called "GuideCam" has been developed alongside existing sky atlas software Aladin providing users with enhanced functionality specifically tailored towards detailed observation preparations across multiple instruments . It's currently being utilized effectively by some instruments while others still rely upon older technologies requiring retrofitting over time until they can transition fully onto "Guidecam". Furthermore "Guidecam" integrates seamlessly with Phase Two proposals replacing older SkyCat software offering simplified creation process while integrating information directly within Finding Charts readily accessible by staff involved throughout each stage from review until execution
Finally , replacing outdated legacy technology used previously TclTk technology Guidecam incorporates advanced functionalities such as generating Finding Charts standardized according service mode compliant standards making it easier than ever before! Information related fiber positioning etc., previously managed through separate auxiliary programs can now directly embed into these updated findings charts facilitating efficient workflows across teams involved throughout every step from review till execution stages!
