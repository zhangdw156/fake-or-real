The current Telescope Control System (ETC) is mainly accessible through specific models with limited script interaction making maintenance challenging hindering batch operations like data collection analysis from telescopes across multiple phases (Phase 1 Phase 2).
A major upgrade project started back in 2017 aiming completion by around year two thousand twenty is underway with key improvements including user interface features like sharing session data from other observatories being incorporated into these changes aimed at improving usability over time
To ensure seamless compatibility across different stages within telescope operation both existing systems have been built upon an identical authoritative instrument definition model ensuring consistent data representation among various components involved
This upgraded framework allows smooth communication between different systems such as those used during Proposal submission phase one (P1) through its ability to integrate seamlessly with existing components like Phase two (P2), allowing users access detailed information regarding telescope usage requirements throughout each phase
Furthermore this upgrade introduces functionalities such as interactive simulations facilitating quality control procedures while providing researchers with flexible options when exploring diverse parameter settings or applying simulations across large datasets
Addressing challenges related complex instrumentation details within existing platforms guidecam has been developed specifically designed around Aladin sky atlas tool allowing easy access through simple plug-in functionality It serves as foundation moving forward towards unified observation preparation platforms
Finally guidecam offers enhanced functionalities including generation of finding charts replacing older SkyCat software simplifying chart creation process while integrating seamlessly with phase two proposals enabling real time access by staff members involved during execution phases .
