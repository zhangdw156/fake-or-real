The local Universe is mostly quiet, with most activities having already occurred. To understand the feedback phenomenon, we need to study the first galaxies that formed shortly after the Big Bang, around 1 to 2 billion years later (redshift z= 3–5). However, these young galaxies are far away, making detailed observation challenging. Recent deep studies of distant Lyman-break galaxies indicate that in these early systems, strong star-formation and the resulting supernovae create winds that push material out of the galaxy. This outflow can be detected by the difference in speed between the Lya emission, which shows the outflowing material, and optical emission lines like Ha and [O II], which represent star-forming areas. Significant velocity differences, of several hundred km/s, have been recorded. If the wind's energy is strong enough, it can expel gas from the galaxy, preventing it from being recaptured and affecting galaxy formation. However, the evidence for this superwind is somewhat indirect and relies on the assumption that the outflow forms a spherical bubble around the galaxy, as depicted in Figure 1. Current data are constrained to traditional long-slit spectroscopy, limiting observations to one dimension. If the high-speed flow occurs within the galaxy, it is less likely to escape its gravitational pull. Alternative interpretations are possible: the outflow might be directed and not prevent gas from entering the galaxy, or it could stall and return to the galaxy, similar to the Milky Way’s "galactic fountain." To clarify this situation, it's essential to identify features in the outflows around distant protogalaxies. By analyzing the outflow's velocity in relation to that of the host galaxy, we can discern its three-dimensional structure. However, due to their distance, even large galaxies only cover a small area in the sky, making it very difficult to obtain detailed spatial information.
