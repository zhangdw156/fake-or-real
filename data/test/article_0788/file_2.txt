Efficient coronagraphy is crucial for achieving the scientific objectives of SPHERE. It works in two ways: it minimizes the brightness of the starlight by at least 100 times and removes diffraction patterns caused by the edges of the optical instrument. Stellar coronagraphy is rapidly advancing, so the instrument needs to be designed for future modifications, allowing for interchangeable masks at both the coronagraph's focus and its input and output pupil areas. The standard coronagraph setup will feature an achromatic four-quadrant phase mask coronagraph (A4Q) that uses precisely positioned four half-wave plates (HWP), along with a classical Lyot coronagraph (CLC) and an apodized Lyot coronagraph (ALC). The A4Q has recently been tested in the visible spectrum, overcoming key challenges related to precise polishing and mounting of the HWPs, and achieving excellent results. Efforts to adapt these techniques for the near-infrared (NIR) range are in progress. The CLC option, with a mask size of about 10 l/D, can be manufactured using traditional methods, while the ALC needs an apodizer in the entrance pupil. Prototyping for this is ongoing, and a viable method using graded metal deposition has been found. Another potential method involves ion implantation but results in distinct steps in the apodization profile. The impact of this is being assessed through simulations.
