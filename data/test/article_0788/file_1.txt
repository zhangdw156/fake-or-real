Efficient coronagraphy is crucial for achieving the scientific objectives of SPHERE. It works in two ways: it reduces the brightness of the starlight by at least 100 times and removes diffraction patterns caused by the edges of the optical system. Stellar coronagraphy is rapidly advancing, so it is essential to design the instrument to accommodate future upgrades by allowing for interchangeable masks at both the coronagraph's focus and its entrance and exit pupil planes. The standard coronagraph setup will feature an achromatic four-quadrant phase mask coronagraph (A4Q) that uses precise placement of four half-wave plates (HWPs), along with a classical Lyot coronagraph (CLC) and an apodised Lyot coronagraph (ALC). The A4Q has recently shown promising results in the visible spectrum, where challenges related to precise edge-polishing and mounting of the HWPs have been successfully addressed. Efforts are underway to adapt these techniques for the near-infrared (NIR). The CLC, with a mask diameter of about 10 l/D, can be manufactured using traditional methods, while the ALC needs an apodiser in the entrance pupil. Prototyping for this is ongoing, and a viable method using graded metal deposition has been found. Another potential method involves ion implantation, but it results in distinct steps in the apodization profile. The impact of this is currently being evaluated through simulations.
