During a week in June 2010, we used EFOSC2 to study various samples. These included minerals and paints, plant leaves, and cyanobacteria films on filter paper. We prepared these samples as thin sheets and placed them in the designated position on a flat-field screen for analysis.  We employed an integrating sphere (a device that provides diffuse illumination) and used spectral region range from 370–930 nm. EFOSC2 covers large areas of the spectrum. The specific wavelength range was achieved using the grism 13, with a resolution of ~ 2.3 nm. We measured both linear and circular polarization for each sample using l/2 and l/4 waveplates.  We obtained measurements by combining multiple exposures at different positions of the waveplate ( –45º, 45º, 135º, 225º for circular, and 0º, 22.5º, 45º,... 335.5º for linear). This "beam swapping" technique minimizes instrument effects. For inorganic samples and leaves, the observation cycle was typically 20 minutes to allow us to measure the polarization level with a statistical error of about 10-4 per spectral bin.  For cyanobacteria, we conducted measurements over several hours but only took about 10 minutes of total exposure time. This yielded a similar statistical error of 10-6 per spectral bin. These figures represent statistical errors due to Poisson noise. With our ultra-high signal-to-noise ratio, we believe we have reached the limits imposed by the polarimetric optics and experimental conditions. We verified the reliability of our error bars through null profiles, which demonstrated random variations around zero within the error ranges.
