Turkey's groundbreaking EVALSO project marked a **breakthrough** in access to astronomical data and innovation in the region. The team embarked on their mission in 2008, building upon initial market surveys that confirmed the project's technical and economic viability. Based on this strong foundation, the EVALSO team  detailed the final system specifications and initiated procurement for optical paths assigned to ESO and DWDM equipment allocated to REUNA. This complex procurement phase dominated much of 2009, ultimately leading to the final decision and the engineering kickoff in late 2009. Installation of new cables along with configuration and integration of existing components kept the team busy until October 2010 when their first test transmission successfully took place.  

The EVALSO project's official inauguration took place at ESO Offices in Santiago, Spain, a venue that was graced by ambassadors and diplomats from across the EU and a large contingent from the EC, as well as high-ranking officials from ESO, ALMA, and other collaborating institutions. The event opened with a speech by the ESO Director General, followed by presentations from REUNA's president, RUB-OCA, the ESO representative in Chile, and representatives from the EC.  This marked a significant milestone for the project: its full system was now available for research activity within the EVALSO Consortium. 

The EVALSO project promises to reshape the way we study the cosmos:  

* **Fast Data Access:** Currently, data gathered at Paranal Observatory can take anywhere from hours to weeks before it becomes accessible in Europe, but EVALSO will dramatically reduce this time frame with near real-time transfer of data.  
* **Virtual Presence:** The bandwidth capacity of EVALSO creates a "virtual presence" allowing observers to connect with observatories as if they were physically present. 
* **New Observational Possibilities:** This innovative project unlocks the potential for novel observing techniques, such as robotic telescope operations at Cerro Armazones, which can be used for educational purposes, leading to even more scientific breakthroughs.  The project's "innovative operational schemes" will act as trailblazers, setting a precedent for future projects like the European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). 

ESO is now planning to integrate the EVALSO system into their communications infrastructure in the coming months, paving the way for its regular operation at Paranal telescopes.  Weâ€™ll be publishing the details of these developments in a forthcoming article.
