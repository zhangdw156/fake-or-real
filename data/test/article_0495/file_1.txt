The EVALSO project began in 2008 by utilizing an existing market survey to assess feasibility. This showed enough promise for continued work, allowing the team to outline the final system specifications and initiate procurement, assigning optical paths to ESO and DWDM equipment to REUNA. The lengthy procurement phase spanning all of 2009 culminated in a final decision and engineering beginning in the last quarter of that year.  Following the completion of procurements in 2010, installation of new cables, configuration, and integration of existing equipment were necessary. By October 2010, the first transmission test could be conducted. The EVALSO formal inauguration took place at ESO offices in Santiago with ambassadors, diplomats from EU countries, a large delegation from the European Commission, high-level officials from ESO, ALMA, and other organizations in attendance. The event was inaugurated by a brief speech by the ESO Director General, and there were presentations by REUNA president, RUB-OCA, the ESO representative in Chile, and EC officials.  The overall system is now available for research use within the EVALSO Consortium. 
The project will focus on three areas:
1) **Swift Data Access**: Current data access from Paranal Observatory can take hours to weeks before becoming accessible in Europe. EVALSO aims to expedite data transfer to near real-time speeds. 
2) **Virtual Observatories**: The bandwidth provided by EVALSO enables a "virtual presence" at observatories, allowing for increased research opportunities and observation capabilities.  
3) **New Observing Possibilities**: EVALSO will support the partners' needs through remote operation of robotic telescopes on Cerro Armazones, educational use of the observatories, and exploration of innovative observation techniques to improve scientific knowledge based on these results. The system will integrate with ESOâ€™s communication infrastructure in the coming months for regular telescope operations at Paranal.


The outcomes from this project development will be reported in a subsequent article.
