A number of O-type stars were found outside of R136 that appear to be single and have speeds consistent with our local position. Out of these, 15 are not associated with a star cluster, leading to similar questions as those surrounding VFTS 682: were they formed within the local environment or ejected from a cluster?  

Two theories for how massive stars form predict different locations. One theory, competitive accretion, states that smaller stars in a cluster provide a well to draw gas and allow some to grow massive, leading to O-type stars. The other, monolithic collapse, suggests stellar mass is set by the initial gas core, resulting in more clustered formation than isolated star births. Studying the density of these high-mass stars can reveal details about how the stellar population formation rate is shaped, which could then help us understand things like galaxy growth and chemical evolution over the universe's history. The question remains, did the high-mass star get its mass set by what kind of cluster it originated in or was it simply based on random chance?  This needs to be clarified with proper motions, and advanced observations using infrared/mm wavelengths.
