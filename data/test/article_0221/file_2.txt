Using cutting edge technology from its extreme adaptive optics system called 'SPHERE', scientists were able to study an area within a large galaxy known as 'Rapple'. They focused their observations towards examining this region's central part using infrared light collected from fruits like 'K' 'J' band images taken through an instrument called 'IRDIS'. They were able to detect over a thousand objects within this small field; each object representing millions upon millions individual stars packed tightly into this region! Through analyzing these oranges they determined that it was likely formed between only a few hundred thousand years old compared with other parts that could be as old as several billion years old! The observations also revealed that they are surrounded by smaller areas where even older stars reside suggesting there has been much change happening here since its early days!
