On the second commissioning night on April 17, several standard stars and scientific targets were observed. Specifically, imaging polarimetry was performed using broadband filters for the magnetic white dwarf LP790-29. The analysis yielded the following results: VB = 5.50 plus or minus 0.07 percent, VV = 7.10 plus or minus 0.05 percent, VR = 9.28 plus or minus 0.04 percent, and Vi = 7.12 plus or minus 0.06 percent, which agrees with earlier measurements. Using another test, Hiltner 652, which is highly linearly polarized, was also measured. For this star, a null circular polarization was expected and the result was indeed VV = 0.03 plus or minus 0.03 percent. This indicates that cross talk between linear and circular polarization is minimal. For the unpolarized standard WD1615-154, the measurement gave VV = 0.03 plus or minus 0.05 percent, regarded to be consistent with a polarization of zero. Additionally, repeating the LP790-29 measurement with the retarder plate set at slightly different angles showed that minor angle variations do not significantly affect the data. During the first visitor night, LP790-20 and WD1615-154 were observed again, producing superconducting results: VV = 7.07 plus or minus 0.09 percent for LP790-29 and VV = 0.00 plus or minus 0.04 percent for WD1615-154. Cross-talk between linear and circular polarization was examined once again using highly linearly polarized standards, yielding results of VV = plus 0.03 plus or minus 0.05 percent and VV = plus 0.03 plus or minus 0.04 percent, which is consistent with zero circular polarization.
