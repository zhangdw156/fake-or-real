On the second commissioning night on April 17, several standard stars and scientific targets were observed. Specifically, imaging polarimetry was performed using broadband filters on the magnetic white dwarf LP790-29, yielding the following results: VB = 5.50 ± 0.07 percent, VV = 7.10 ± 0.05 percent, VR = 9.28 ± 0.04 percent, and Vi = 7.12 ± 0.06 percent. These results align with previous measurements. Another test involved measuring Hiltner 652, a highly linearly polarized standard star, where we expected to measure no circular polarization; the result was VV = 0.03 ± 0.03 percent. This indicates that the cross talk between linear and circular polarization is minimal. The measurement of WD1615-154, an unpolarized standard, showed VV = 0.03 ± 0.05 percent, consistent with no polarization. Additionally, measurements for LP790-29 were repeated with the retarder plate at slightly different angles, which showed that a few degrees of difference had no significant effect on the results. During the first visitor night, LP790-20 and WD1615-154 were observed again, providing consistent outcomes: VV = 7.07 ± 0.09 percent for LP790-29 and VV = 0.00 ± 0.04 percent for WD1615-154. The linear-circular polarization cross talk was re-evaluated with highly linearly polarized standards, resulting in VV = 0.03 ± 0.05 percent and VV = 0.03 ± 0.04 percent, which again confirmed zero circular polarization.
