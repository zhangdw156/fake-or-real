The Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) is a 4-meter telescope designed for near-infrared observations, featuring a large array of 16 infrared detectors that cover a field of view of 1.5 square degrees. Figure 4 illustrates the VIRCAM field of view, with the moon included for size comparison. The set of filters for VISTA includes Z, Y, J, H, Ks, and a narrowband filter at 1.18 microns. Each image taken will have 67 Megapixels, and on a typical observing night, around 300 GB of data will be collected. This large amount of data will require efficient processing and significant resources. Currently, six VISTA Public Surveys (PS) have been proposed by the VISTA Public Survey Panel and approved by the Observing Program Committee (OPC). These proposals are in the process of submitting their Survey Management Plans (SMP), pending final approval. The surveys are listed below based on their priority for implementation as determined by the VISTA Public Survey Panel, and Figure 5 shows their coverage in the sky. The VISTA PS are expected to start data collection in late 2007 and will run for five years. Basic information about the VISTA surveys is summarized in Table 2. The latest progress of the VISTA project was discussed in The Messenger, and additional details can be found on the VISTA website.
