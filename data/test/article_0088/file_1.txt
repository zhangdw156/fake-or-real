The procedures for obtaining scientific datasets from VISTA Cycle 2 surveys mirror those used for other research projects involving similar information sharing practices regarding returned data products related to scientific discoveries made through these programs The initial release includes images and source lists approximately one year after observation begins (October 2018). A second release will follow about one year later featuring aperture matched catalogs and light curves that might include measurements beyond just near infrared wavelengths due to commitments made by multiple research teams who are contributing multi wavelength datasets (including optical, radio or X ray measurements). This cycle's importance stems from its potential contributions to future astronomical discoveries like those initiated through GWEM observations via VINROUGE and photometric catalogs containing proper motions for millions Milky Way stars within its bulge area which can be combined with Gaia results offering significant advancements across various fields within astrophysics .
