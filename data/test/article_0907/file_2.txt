A key activity across ALMA is the System Engineering and Integration (SE&I) task, which coordinates various project activities. One main goal of SE&I is to ensure that modules and equipment created for different ALMA subsystems, often produced in various global locations, fit together physically and functionally. SE&I also manages the ALMA system design, technical budgets, and the overall system integrity, making sure that all interfaces between subsystems are clearly understood, well-defined, rigorously reviewed, and properly documented. To accomplish these tasks, the SE&I team plays a central role in preparing and managing project performance and engineering requirements, as well as Interface Control Documents. SE&I actively organizes, conducts, and leads technical reviews of the project, both internally and externally, to assess the status and progress of ALMA component design and manufacturing by industry and scientific institutions. Product and Quality Assurance is another important task, with increased visibility during the manufacturing phase. The SE&I group also leads the Prototype System Integration activities and testing at the ALMA Test Facility (ATF) in Socorro. In 2007 and 2008, the ATF will integrate ALMA hardware and software into an operational system using prototype antennas from Europe and North America. In collaboration with the ALMA Science team, initial fringes were recorded in March 2007. The ATF also trains integration and operations staff for Chile and qualifies equipment needed for acceptance tasks there, like the Optical Pointing Telescope and the Holography System. Another significant activity in the coming years will be the Assembly, Integration, and Verification (AIV) at the Operations Support Facility (OSF). Equipment acceptance has already begun, and AIV at the OSF will start with antenna delivery in mid-2007, for which preparations are currently in progress.
