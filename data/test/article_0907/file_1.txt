A key task across ALMA is the System Engineering and Integration (SE&I), which focuses on coordinating activities throughout the project. One main goal of SE&I is to ensure that modules and equipment made for various ALMA subsystems, often produced in different global locations, fit together both physically and functionally. Moreover, SE&I oversees the design, technical budgets, and the overall system integrity and must ensure that all interfaces between subsystems are clearly understood, defined, rigorously reviewed, and documented. To accomplish these tasks, the SE&I team plays a central role in preparing and managing project performance, engineering requirements, and Interface Control Documents. They are actively involved in organizing and leading technical reviews for both internal and external parties to assess the status and progress of ALMA component design and manufacturing. Product and Quality Assurance will prominently feature during the manufacturing phase. The SE&I group also leads the Prototype System Integration and testing in the ALMA Test Facility (ATF) in Socorro. During 2007 and 2008, this facility will be utilized for integrating ALMA hardware and software into an operational system using prototype antennas from Europe and North America. A joint effort with the ALMA Science team successfully captured the first fringes in March 2007. The ATF will also train personnel for integration and operations in Chile and help qualify equipment for acceptance tasks in Chile, like the Optical Pointing Telescope and Holography System. In the coming years, another significant focus will be on Assembly, Integration, and Verification (AIV) at the OSF, which has begun with equipment acceptance and will progress with antenna delivery set for mid-2007, with preparations already underway.
