One of the key historical uses of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has been their role as 'markers' for distant galaxies and proto-clusters. Powerful radio galaxies have long been used for this purpose due to their high visibility. It is believed, based on their placement in the K-band Hubble diagram, that these sources indicate the existence of large host galaxies. With sensitive Mid-Infrared (MIR) measurements from Spitzer, it is now possible to validate this belief using measurements of the H-band luminosity, which is less affected by AGN interference and can be easily adjusted for minor inaccuracies. These sources also help identify protoclusters at distances that other methods cannot reach. Multi-band photometry can facilitate the search for areas with a higher concentration of sources exhibiting characteristics like specific spectral energy distributions (SED) and/or Ly-alpha emission, which are expected of cluster members. Large Ly-alpha halos are commonly associated with these objects and provide insights into the sources of ionizing radiation and large-scale gas movements in galaxies during their early development. In addition to those around radio galaxies, Ly-alpha emission is also being observed around some quieter sources, particularly those detected at sub-millimeter wavelengths.
