A key historical role of AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) has been to serve as placeholders for distant galaxies and early clusters. Their high visibility has made powerful radio galaxies valuable in this respect. Based on where they appear on the K-band Hubble diagram, researchers suggest these objects signify large host galaxies. Recently, sensitive mid-infrared (MIR) data from Spitzer has allowed researchers to validate this idea by looking at H-band luminosity, which is mostly unaffected by AGN interference and has manageable correction factors. These AGN also help locate protoclusters at higher redshifts than other detection methods can reach. Multi-band photometry is then used to look for higher concentrations of sources that have traits, such as specific spectral energy distribution shapes or distinct Ly-alpha emissions, which are typical of ‘cluster’ members. Extended Ly_alpha halos seem to always surround these objects and offer insights into sources of ionizing radiation and large gas movements in long-evolving galaxies. Additionally, along with the emissions around radio galaxies, emissions of Ly-alpha radiation are now also observed in some less active sources, particularly those found at sub-mm sound levels.
