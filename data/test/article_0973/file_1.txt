We know that many prefer untouched deserts instead of being overrun by all-inclusive tourists. However, if we want to fully explore the redshift desert, what options do we have? One option is to use VIMOS with much longer observation times than the 5 hours currently used by the zCOSMOS project—potentially 30 hours or more, like the GMASS project. Before this can happen, VIMOS should be made as efficient as FORS2 in the red wavelengths, which may occur soon. In terms of field of view, VIMOS can cover an area equivalent to four FORS units, so capturing all the COSMOS pBzKs (along with more star-forming galaxies) would require about a quarter of the time we estimated for FORS2, roughly 350 VLT nights. While this still seems like a long time, it's more manageable than a direct effort with FORS2. VIMOS was originally designed for large redshift surveys, so this could be a fitting project. But how long is 350 nights? For context, zCOSMOS took 640 hours (about 75 nights) over four semesters to complete. If VIMOS could be used for zCOSMOS whenever the COSMOS field is about 4 hours from the meridian, we must consider that poor weather, competing projects, and instrument downtime have stretched zCOSMOS to five years. Thus, it would take about 25 years for an upgraded VIMOS to adequately explore just the COSMOS field. What we really need is a high-multiplex instrument that can capture the main spectral features of galaxies with redshift between 1.4 and 2.5, specifically the [O ii] 3727 Å line for star-forming galaxies and Ca ii H and K lines with the 4000 Å break for passive galaxies. These features fall within the J-band, which means a cryogenic instrument isn't necessary. A room-temperature instrument could cover large areas in a single telescope position without worrying about thermal background interference. Knowing the distribution of the [O ii] line flux for star-forming galaxies in the desert is crucial for planning a targeted spectroscopic survey, but we don’t have that information yet. For the full COSMOS sample down to K about 23.5 magnitudes, the surface density of these galaxies is approximately 4 per square arcminute, or about 1 per square arcminute for the brighter ones down to J equal to 22. Thus, the ideal VLT instrument would fully utilize the VLT’s largest field of view (about 500 square arcminutes at the Nasmyth focus) with a multiplexing capability of at least 1 square arcminute, allowing for approximately 500 observations across the entire field. This could only be achieved with a fibre-fed zJ-band spectrograph, similar to the FMOS instrument on SUBARU. This type of instrument may offer the best short-term option for exploring the redshift desert.
