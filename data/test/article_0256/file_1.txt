Each telescope uses an advanced camera for capturing images in infrared light that's extremely sensitive to faint objects in space due to its cold temperature (-67 degrees Celsius). This allows astronomers to see distant objects clearly even when they are very faint or obscured by dust or gas clouds within galaxies or nebulae etc., The cameras have high resolution capability that captures detailed images over wide fields across vast distances in space as well as specialized narrow band light detection capabilities for studying specific elements like hydrogen or oxygen atoms within stars or planets . They can be used for observing various types including star formation regions , planetary systems , black holes , supernova remnants etc., and their features allow astronomers access diverse information about celestial bodies they study .
