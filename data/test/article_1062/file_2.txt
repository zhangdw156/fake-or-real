A VLT Large Programme to Study Galaxies at z ~ 2: GMASS — the Galaxy Mass Assembly Ultra-deep Spectroscopic Survey

We present the reasons for our study, how we chose our sample, and our initial findings from the VLT FORS2 Large Programme, which has captured the longest targeted spectra of distant galaxies to date using the VLT. These lengthy exposures, lasting up to 77 hours for objects across three masks, were necessary to identify spectral features of very faint galaxies, like absorption lines from passive galaxies at z > 1.4, a group that had previously gone unnoticed due to their low visibility in optical wavelengths but is important for understanding massive galaxy evolution. The ultra-deep spectroscopy enabled us to estimate the stellar metallicity of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2, examine color variations up to z = 2, and identify a galaxy cluster ancestor at z = 1.6. The spectra produced by GMASS provide a valuable resource, filling in the “redshift desert” in GOODS-S.
