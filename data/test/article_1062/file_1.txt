A VLT Large Programme for Studying Galaxies at Redshift around 2: GMASS â€” the Galaxy Mass Assembly Ultra-Deep Spectroscopic Survey

We present the goals, sample choices, and initial findings of our VLT FORS2 Large Programme, which collected the longest precise spectra of distant galaxies ever captured by the VLT. These long exposures, totaling up to 77 hours for objects from three masks, were essential to identify spectral features of very faint galaxies, such as absorption lines from passive galaxies at redshift greater than 1.4. This galaxy group had largely been overlooked due to its low visibility in optical wavelengths, but it plays an important role in the development of large galaxies. The ultra-deep spectroscopy enabled us to analyze the stellar composition of star-forming galaxies at redshift around 2, document color changes up to redshift 2, and study a probable progenitor of a galaxy cluster at redshift 1.6. The numerous spectra produced by GMASS provide valuable data for understanding this so-called "redshift desert" in the GOODS-S area.
