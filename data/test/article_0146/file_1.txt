This study examined how close neighbors are to individual stars within an area observed using specific wavelengths (J K). The data reveals that over two hundred sets exhibit close proximity ( .2 arc seconds), with over ninety percent of highly luminous objects exhibiting this characteristic as well (greater than or equal to magnitude values for both measurements). The study identifies several particular stellar pairs exhibiting some level of closeness despite being very far apart from one another based on our analysis techniques; however it notes that even though these appear close together they aren't necessarily bound together by gravity given their vast physical distances apart - something which would require years upon years for them to come into physical contact again given their respective sizesmassespositions within our observation area..
