The study analyzed how close neighboring stars are to each other based on their positions within specific wavelengths (J Ks). The results show that many pairs had very close neighbors within just under half an arcsecond apart (less than .2 arcseconds), particularly for bright objects classified as "massive." This finding was especially true for some particularly large stars like those designated R series members: some were found to be visually linked but not gravitationally bound due to distances exceeding what would be expected for such close proximity over long periods - potentially suggesting they aren't truly interacting gravitationally despite appearing visually connected..
