In recent decades, scientists have focused on understanding how supermassive black holes affect galaxy evolution. These black holes were previously thought to be rare events, but now we know all massive galaxies have experienced their influence at some point during their lifetime. The most accurate models of galaxy formation rely on the inclusion of "energetic feedback processes" that connect these black holes to the gas in the surrounding galaxies, which ultimately lead to a better understanding of how galaxies evolve. Even though these black holes are tiny compared to the overall size of the galaxies they inhabit, their influence is vast and powerful.  For example, the black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy can release an enormous amount of energy â€“ enough to power countless stars. It's clear that supermassive black holes act as powerful energy sources. As a result, their interaction with gas creates large-scale outflows, which may ultimately impact star formation in the host galaxy. These impacts are crucial to building realistic galaxies in cosmological models; however, observing them more directly is necessary to solidify this understanding. This article focuses on a new survey using K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The results from this large-scale study should provide valuable insights into the prevalence, characteristics and effects of these outflows in distant galaxies with supermassive black holes.
