Initially, filtering data from the telescope was reliable. However, around October 2008, the filter wheel (the only moving part inside the cold camera) occasionally failed to reach its intended position. Multiple investigations into software and electronics were conducted, but the intermittent issue progressively worsened. By February 2009, it became necessary to remove the camera, warm it up, open the cryostat, and inspect the parts.  A loose jacking screw (used for assembly and disassembly) was discovered to be responsible for fouling the filter wheel, causing scraping of paint and metal swarf. This explains the unexpected changes in the flat fields. The filter trays were removed, the filters cleaned, debris was removed from other camera parts, and the faulty jacking screw was replaced. No damage to the filters or detectors occurred, and the motor drive proved strong and reliable. Using this opportunity, the filter wheel's order was reorganized for optimal operation within the ESO Public Surveys. A spare filter tray was also filled with two paired sets of narrowband filters at 975 and 985 nm. After pumping and cooling down again, VISTA resumed observation in March 2009.
