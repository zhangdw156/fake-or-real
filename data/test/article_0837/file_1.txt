Early-type galaxies found in clusters show a clear relationship between their color and brightness, known as the red sequence. Different red sequences have been identified for clusters up to a redshift of 1.5, suggesting that there are many passively evolving galaxies whose star formation stopped long before they were observed. However, not all red sequence galaxies today were red and inactive in the distant past. Evidence indicates a downsizing effect in how red sequences developed in clusters: generally, the most massive and luminous galaxies ceased star formation and entered the red sequence earlier than their less massive counterparts. This has been shown using EDisCS data through various methods. The change in the ratio of bright to faint red galaxies indicates a shortage of faint red galaxies in distant clusters compared to those nearby. Supporting this, the brightness distribution of red galaxies aligns with passive evolution for the bright galaxies but shows a significant increase in faint galaxies as redshift decreases. Compared to bright red galaxies, there are more faint red galaxies in the general field than in clusters at redshifts of 0.6–0.8, but fewer at 0.4–0.6. This difference in evolutionary rates suggests that cluster environments are more effective than field environments in increasing the number of galaxies in the red sequence at redshifts less than 1. Additionally, an analysis of spectral line indices, which reveals stellar population ages, metallicities, and α-element enhancements, shows that massive red galaxies follow passive evolution with early formation times, while less massive galaxies require longer star formation histories. Even the Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs), the most massive galaxies, follow the downsizing pattern: their color evolution and K-band luminosity suggests they formed at redshifts greater than 2 and then evolved passively. Contrary to earlier studies, BCGs in EDisCS clusters have not shown significant changes in stellar mass since redshift 1. Clusters with higher velocity dispersions and masses tend to host brighter and more massive BCGs, but this relationship is weak, with the stellar mass of BCGs changing by only 70% across a broad range of cluster masses.
