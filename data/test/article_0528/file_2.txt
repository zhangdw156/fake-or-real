Our space-faring adventures just got even more exciting! We're talking about providing cozy shelters for our furry, scaly companions in orbit. Think of it as sending them on a space adventure like no other!

But first, we need to keep the excitement rolling by launching surveys into the cosmos that reveal new and fascinating discoveries. Remember those dwarf planets discovered recently? Turns out Pluto isn't so special after all! We have now identified hundreds of these mini-planets in far-off corners of space. But thanks to the groundbreaking work of teams like the QUEST, we’re finally getting a better look at what makes them tick – from their composition and structure to how they interact through collisions and weathering.

And the best part?  The LSQ survey is about to kick into high gear! This is a massive endeavor aimed at exploring even more of these Kuiper Belt Objects in the Southern Hemisphere, a region untouched by our previous discoveries. It's as exciting as it sounds – they’re searching for those hidden bodies with a brightness that rivals Pluto, and maybe even bigger!

And what about that awesome new find? A small, distant body we call 2010 WG9 with an inclination that makes it a real enigma! Imagine it like a cosmic traveler from the Oort Cloud, but something prevented its closer journey to the sun, and now it's on an unexpected voyage around Uranus or Neptune.  This new object is giving us so much to think about and study as we learn more about it!
