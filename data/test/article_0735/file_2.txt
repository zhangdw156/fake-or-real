To study the early stages of galaxy evolution, we chose a sample of 17 quasar lines of sight with redshifts greater than 4 observed with UVES/VLT. We analyzed the statistical properties of 21 new sub-DLAs along with those from a previous ESO archive study. This uniform sample allowed us to assess how the number density of DLAs and sub-DLAs changes with redshift. All these systems appear to evolve within the redshift range from 5 to about 3. Assuming all types of absorbers come from the same parent population, we calculated their typical sizes. The typical radius increases as the column density decreases and declines over time for all systems. The sub-DLA downsizing changes from kiloparsecs at redshift 4 to kiloparsecs at redshift 2. We also presented the redshift evolution of the column density distribution, f(N,z), for two different redshift intervals. A deviation from the usual power law occurs in the sub-DLA category. We used f(N,z) to estimate the total H I gas mass in the Universe at redshifts greater than 2. Our complete sample of sub-DLAs indicates that they significantly contribute to the total gas mass, making up about 20% (or more compared to the most recent Sloan results) at redshifts from 5 to 2. The WHI observed in both DLAs and sub-DLAs at high redshifts is relatively low compared to the mass density in stars today, WT. The debate continues about whether many quasar absorbers are missing in optical quasar surveys. While radio surveys finding DLAs in quasar samples without optical limits suggest that not many are missing, we still expect high-redshift galaxies to have dust. It should be noted that there are two distinct issues: the dust content of the known quasar absorbers and the fraction of absorbers that are overlooked because their background quasars were not selected initially.
