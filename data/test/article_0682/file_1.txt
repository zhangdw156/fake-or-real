Analyzing these stellar images offers us tantalizing insights into the workings of circumstellar discs – those swirling clouds of gas and dust that surround young stars. Let's break it down:

**What we see:** We can pinpoint the disc's spatial footprint, its directionality (inclination & position angle), and measure how bright it appears.  We even get a feel for the surface brightness changes across the disc as it gets larger – essentially mapping "flared" or "flat" surfaces. The profiles of HD97048, for example, show a dramatic drop-off, hinting at unexpected disturbances in the disc's structure around 50 and 110 astronomical units. This could mean something odd is happening at those points – perhaps dust grains are changing their behavior. 

In contrast, HD100546 offers a simpler profile with more rapid brightness decline. It lacks any jarring breaks, providing clarity about its structure. 

We're not limited to surface analysis! By digging deeper into the images we can even find hidden structures in the inner regions of these discs – an example shows a "hole" north-east of the disc near 30 astronomical units.  The cause remains a mystery, but it might signal active planet formation!

**Unveiling the mysteries:** Our observations also provide clues about potential planets lurking within the stellar system's discs. The absence of these planets in our images doesn’t prove their absence; instead, they suggest their existence is shrouded in shadow. 

Finally, we look to the polarization of light for more insight into the dust grains themselves. These particles are responsible for scattering and absorbing stellar light – affecting how much gets trapped within deeper layers of the disc, essentially acting as energy budget regulators for the system's overall development.  

**ESA's new focus:**  A significant announcement comes from ESA – they will now be conducting research underground! Their approach is taking us into a new era of understanding these discs - the depths we’ve yet to explore are just waiting for the right opportunity and advanced technology!
