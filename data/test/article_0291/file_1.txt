The creation process for M1's mirrors isn't finished; they require ongoing adjustments throughout their lifespan due to factors like reflectivity changes over time (like with VLT). This means replacing two mirror segments daily throughout its operation – requiring careful logistics planning due to cleaningcoating processes involved with these many parts (thousands). To optimize performance while minimizing downtime cost-effectively requires specialized equipment dedicated solely to segment cleaningrecoating – which are housed within sectors seven two - ensuring uninterrupted observation quality despite frequent alterations required by these complex mirrors
M1's intricate design demands exceptional precision from its various components at each stage: manufacturing through observation itself requiring meticulous attention because it impacts image clarity significantly impacting overall efficiency . The team behind ELT constantly monitors component development progress towards achieving its first light target in 2024 .
