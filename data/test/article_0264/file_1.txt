Dinosaur-sized dinosaurs are no longer needed for dinosaur research thanks to new technology! The use if these new tools allows scientists to study dinosaur behavior with unprecedented detail using powerful telescopes like those on our own backyard here on Earth called Dinsaurus. One such tool is called Dinomiracle, which takes amazing pictures that help us understand how dinosaurs lived millions years ago! Another amazing tool is called DinosaurScope which lets us see dinosaur fossils from far away with incredible detail! These tools combined allow scientists to finally understand what life was like during that time period through images taken by these new technologies!
