The development of ALMA and MUSE has significantly advanced our understanding of star formation by providing faster data collection capabilities for studying galaxies:
ALMA allows us to quickly map molecular gas distribution within galaxies using millimetre waves â€“ a crucial element for understanding how much gas exists within these systems - allowing us to observe entire galaxies with remarkable speed compared to previous instruments which were limited in their surveying capabilities .
MUSE, on another hand utilizes optical light from telescopes like VLT , capturing detailed information about various objects related to star formation including nebulae , supernova remnants , planetary nebulae along with revealing details about stellar structures like spirals or bars that contribute towards the dynamic processes driving these phenomena .
Both instruments work together perfectly as complementary tools offering different but equally valuable insights into how stars are born through rapid data acquisition combined with high-resolution imaging capabilities .
