We examined how the radial velocities relate to metallicity for Bulge field stars in three areas. First, as expected, the velocity dispersion (σRV) decreases along the Bulge's minor axis: σRV = 105 km/s in Baade’s Window, σRV = 84 km/s in the field at b = –6°, and σRV = 80 km/s in the field at b = –12°. This last figure drops further to σRV = 60 km/s if we exclude five stars with absolute velocity |VRV| > 150 km/s (possibly halo stars). Second, the velocity dispersion of the metal-rich stars varies across the three fields along the minor axis, being colder than the metal-poor stars in the inner region, similar in the middle region, and very cold in the outer region. The outer field contains some disc stars, leading us to believe that the metal-rich stars here actually belong to the thin disc. Meanwhile, the two innermost fields have very little disc contamination, making it difficult to understand the contrasting kinematics between the metal-rich and metal-poor components.
