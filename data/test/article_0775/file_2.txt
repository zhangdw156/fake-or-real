We examined how the radial velocities relate to metallicity for Bulge field stars in three areas. First, as anticipated, the velocity dispersion (σRV) decreases along the Bulge's minor axis, starting at σRV = 105 km/s in Baade’s Window, then σRV = 84 km/s in the b = –6° field, and finally σRV = 80 km/s in the b = –12° field. This last value could drop to σRV = 60 km/s if we exclude the five stars with absolute velocities |VRV| > 150 km/s, which may be halo stars. Second, the velocity dispersion of the metal-rich stars behaves differently across the three fields along the minor axis: it is higher than that of metal-poor stars in the innermost field, roughly equal in the middle field, and much lower in the outermost field. The outermost field contains disc stars, suggesting that the metal-rich tail consists of thin disc stars. In contrast, the two innermost fields have little disc contamination, making the interpretation of the differing kinematics between the metal-rich and metal-poor components complex.
