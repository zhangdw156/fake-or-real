Ups Sgr is a star system that's nearing its end stages where one star has shed its outer layers and currently experiences another burst of gas loss as it burns through helium at its core. This pair orbits each other every 138 days, and they're surrounded by dust forming a ring around them called a "torus". Observations using both infrared telescopes have revealed this ring to be relatively small compared to stars like our sun but it appears to be very active with lots going on inside it! The team hopes to use new imaging techniques combined with spectral measurements to map out this dynamic environment more precisely over time as they study how it changes through different phases within their orbit together!
