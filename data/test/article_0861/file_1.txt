The rapid growth of astronomy in Spain over the past thirty years best characterizes its current status. By the late 1970s, there were only a few active astronomers and limited research activities. The Jesuits operated several observatories, including the Carthusian Observatory in Granada, the Ebro Observatory, and the Fabra Observatory in Barcelona, which continue to study meteorology, geophysics, and astronomy since their establishment in the early twentieth century. The Naval Astronomical Observatory in San Fernando was established over 50 years ago to train naval officers in navigation. One of its main tasks was to prepare the Nautical Almanac, and, along with the National Astronomical Observatory, it provided the official time in Spain. Currently, the Royal Institute and Observatory in San Fernando manages the Carlsberg meridian telescope among other projects. The National Astronomical Observatory in Madrid, part of the National Geographical Institute, has been involved in optical astronomy and is now recognized as a key player in radio astronomy in Spain, Europe, and globally. Additionally, some universities have astronomy professorships, typically focused on the mathematical aspects of astronomy and teaching positional astronomy to scientists and engineers.
