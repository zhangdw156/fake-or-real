The initial release of the 2dF quasar survey has greatly increased the number of known quasar pairs with a separation of arcminutes. We selected pairs based on these criteria: (1) the two quasars should be spaced 1 to 4 arcminutes apart, where strong correlation is likely; (2) the quasars must have a brightness of mV less than 20.30 to keep observing time manageable; (3) the quasars’ emission redshifts should be greater than z ≈ 2.1 to enhance the wavelength range for obtaining high signal-to-noise ratios; (4) the redshift difference needs to be less than Δz ≈ 0.5 (typically 0.3) to maximize the wavelength range for studying correlations. There are 22 quasar pairs in the 2dF survey that fit our criteria, of which we observed 20. Twelve pairs already known were included in this sample. We obtained the quasars' spectra using FORS1 and 2 on VLT UT2 and UT3, employing grism GR630B and a 0.7 arcsecond slit. The final spectral resolution achieved was R = 1400, with a full width at half maximum of 220 km/s at 3,800 Å. We adjusted the exposure times to achieve a typical signal-to-noise ratio of about 10 at 3,500 Å, while at around 4,500 Å, the signal-to-noise ratio is generally over 70. Typical spectra of the QSO pairs are provided in the text. For calculating the longitudinal correlation function, we also utilized data from the Large Programme “The Cosmic Evolution of the IGM,” which produced a high-quality sample of absorption spectra suitable for studying the Lyman-alpha forest in the redshift range of 1.7 to 4.5. The Large Programme spectra were captured with VLT-UVES, offering high resolution (R ≈ 45,000) and high signal-to-noise ratios.
