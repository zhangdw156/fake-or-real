The initial release of the 2dF quasar survey has greatly increased the number of known quasar pairs spaced a few arcminutes apart. We selected pairs based on these criteria: (1) separation between the two quasars must be between 1 and 4 arcmin for strong correlation; (2) the quasars should be brighter than an apparent magnitude of 20.30 to keep observation times reasonable; (3) the redshifts of the two quasars must be above approximately 2.1 to broaden the wavelength range with good signal-to-noise ratios; and (4) the difference in redshift should be less than approximately 0.5 (mostly around 0.3) to enhance the wavelength range that can be analyzed for correlations. The 2dF survey found 22 quasar pairs that meet our criteria, and we observed 20 of them. We included twelve previously known pairs in this study. The quasar spectra were collected using the FORS1 and 2 instruments mounted on VLT UT2 and UT3, utilizing grism GR630B with a 0.7 arcsec slit. The final spectral resolution was R equal to 1400, which corresponds to a full width at half maximum of 220 km/s at a wavelength of 3,800 Å. Exposure times were adjusted to achieve a typical signal-to-noise ratio of about 10 at 3,500 Å, while at around 4,500 Å, the signal-to-noise ratio generally exceeds 70. Examples of the observed spectra of the quasar pairs are provided in the text. For calculating the longitudinal correlation function, we also used data from the Large Programme “The Cosmic Evolution of the IGM,” which has created a sample of uniformly high-quality absorption spectra suitable for exploring the Lyman-alpha forest at redshifts from 1.7 to 4.5. These spectra were captured with VLT-UVES and exhibit high resolution (R approximately equal to 45,000) and high signal-to-noise ratios.
