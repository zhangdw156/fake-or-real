ESO-Chile Fund for Astronomy: 10 Years of Successful Scientific Collaboration  
In a ceremony in Santiago in June 2006, ESO and the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs celebrated the 10th Anniversary of the Supplementary Agreement. This agreement granted Chilean astronomers up to 10% of the total observing time on ESO telescopes and created an annual fund for astronomy development, managed by the ‘ESO-Chile Joint Committee’. The event was hosted by ESO Director General, Dr. Catherine Cesarsky, and Ambassador Luis Winter, the Director of Special Policy for the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Dr. Cesarsky stated, “ESO's commitment long-term is to foster astronomy and scientific knowledge in the host country,” adding hopes for continued achievements between Chile and Europe in their mutual effort to explore the Universe. Representing the Chilean government, Ambassador Winter emphasized the historical significance of the Supplementary Agreement, approved by the Chilean Congress in 1996. “The impact of the ESO-Chile Joint Committee was such that, in 2005, this annual fund accounted for eight percent of all funding for Chilean astronomy, including that from universities and governmental sources,” he noted. The ceremony also included Dr. Leonardo Bronfman, the Chilean appointee for the ESO-Chile Joint Committee, along with ambassadors in Chile from ESO member states and other representatives from the Chilean government and scientific community.
