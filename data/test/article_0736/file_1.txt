ESO-Chile Fund for Astronomy: 10 Years of Successful Scientific Collaboration  
In a ceremony in Santiago in June 2006, ESO and the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs marked the 10th Anniversary of the Supplementary Agreement. This agreement allowed Chilean astronomers to access up to 10% of the total observing time on ESO telescopes and created an annual fund for advancing astronomy, overseen by the ‘ESO-Chile Joint Committee.’ The event was led by ESO Director General, Dr. Catherine Cesarsky, and the Director of Special Policy from the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Luis Winter. Dr. Cesarsky stated, “ESO’s commitment is, and always will be, to foster astronomy and scientific knowledge in the country hosting our observatories.” She expressed hope that Chile and Europe would continue to achieve great things in their collaborative exploration of the Universe. Ambassador Luis Winter, representing the Chilean government, emphasized the historical significance of the Supplementary Agreement, which was ratified by the Chilean Congress in 1996. “In 2005, the ESO-Chile Joint Committee's annual fund accounted for eight percent of all funding for Chilean astronomy, including government and university sources,” said Ambassador Winter. The ceremony also featured Dr. Leonardo Bronfman, the Chilean astronomer on the ESO-Chile Joint Committee, along with ambassadors from ESO member states and representatives from the Chilean government and scientific community.
