Principal Investigators (PIs) who have submitted public survey proposals reviewed by the Public Survey Panel (PSP) and recommended by the Observing Programme Committee (OPC) are required to submit a Survey Management Plan (SMP). Guidelines for preparing the SMP are available from ESO. The SMP is an additional requirement from the PIs and is a key part of ESO's evaluation of the proposal. Its purpose is to gather essential information needed for conducting public surveys in Service Mode (SM) and to facilitate effective planning for Phase 2 and telescope operations. The SMP must detail the observing strategy, calibration needs for survey data, the data reduction process, available manpower and hardware resources, the data quality assessment process, and how data products will be delivered to the Virtual Observatory. Throughout the SMP process, collaboration with the Survey Consortia will ensure that there are never more than two active public surveys covering the same right ascension range or similar observing conditions at any time.
