Principal Investigators (PIs) who have submitted public survey proposals reviewed by the Public Survey Panel (PSP) and endorsed by the Observing Programme Committee (OPC) are required to follow up with a Survey Management Plan (SMP). The ESO provides guidelines for creating the SMP. This plan is an additional requirement from the PIs and is essential to ESO's evaluation of the proposal. The primary objective of the SMP is to gather necessary information for conducting public surveys in Service Mode (SM) and to facilitate careful and timely planning for Phase 2 and telescope operations. The documented SMP should detail the observing strategy, requirements for survey data calibration, the data reduction process, staffing and hardware resources, data quality evaluation procedures, and the distribution of data products to the Virtual Observatory. During the SMP development phase, consultations between Survey Consortia to finalize the observing strategy will ensure that only two public surveys share the same RA range or similar observing conditions at any given time.
