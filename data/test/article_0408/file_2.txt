VIMOS is a large instrument that weighs three tons and has some mechanical flexure (movement) between its imaging plane and the detector, which affects image quality during long exposures. This flexure causes blurring of images, makes calibration more challenging, and hinders accurate measurements in object positions used for tasks like MOS mask production. A passive system was initially installed to compensate for this flexure, reducing it by four pixels. However, this system is difficult to maintain or adjust, and in 2009 some arms exhibited flexures of nearly six pixels during instrument rotation, significantly impacting operations.

To address these challenges, an active flexure compensation system (AFC) was installed. Two motors on each arm's fold mirror allow precise adjustment of the image on the detector to correct for flexure during observation. A reference fiber in the focal plane outside the normal imaging field is then used to pre-align the focal plane before observations are started, eliminating movement issues that could affect source location in the slit and causing timing discrepancies between science data collection and calibration. The accuracy of target positioning with the current AFC system is one pixel, while calibration and scientific observation registration accuracy is around two pixels. This latter registration suffers from some hysteresis issues.  The recent installation of the AFC allowed for precise control and centering of targets across all four quadrants simultaneously.
