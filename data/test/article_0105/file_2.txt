After receiving formal approval from both panels involved in this rigorous selection process ,the surveyed team creates detailed plans outlining how they will collect analyze vast amounts fruitfully gathered information about space objects or phenomena . These comprehensive plans are then reviewed thoroughly before being finalized with an official agreement signed between both parties involved - notably comprised of representatives from both sides - agreeing upon key aspects like timelines responsibilities related to delivering high quality research outcomes throughout various stages . Finally , after all collected information has been thoroughly processed during this extensive period ,a final comprehensive dataset containing all collected information becomes publicly available within one year after completion date . Regular reviews conducted periodically allow ongoing monitoring evaluation against previously agreed standards ensuring continued excellence across all aspects related fruitfully gathered fruitfully gathered fruits .
