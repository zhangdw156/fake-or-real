ESO selects its public surveys through two steps: first submitting letters outlining proposed research; then reviewing those proposals with an advisory panel called "The Public Survey Panel" who choose teams based on merit before recommending them formally to receive full grant proposals from those selected researchers This helps foster collaboration across different research groups working towards common goals . Once approved by both panels ,ESO begins collecting astronomical observations using carefully crafted plans detailing how they will acquire this massive amounts information . These plans are reviewed thoroughly before being finalized with input from both scientists involved in conducting it operations personnel at ESO . Finally , an official agreement outlines detailed expectations about milestones related to releasing specific datasets ensuring high quality standards are met throughout all phases A formal assessment conducted annually evaluates how well these public surveys are progressing against pre-established targets .
