HARPS observations use a method called the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect to study exoplanet atmospheres. These methods allow scientists to directly analyze light that passes through planets' atmospheres and measure how this light changes based on wavelength. This technique can be especially useful for small, distant planets that might otherwise have trouble with existing observational techniques.  This article details a successful experiment using HARPS instrument to replicate Earth transit observations by observing lunar eclipse phases and the resulting reflection of moonlight.
