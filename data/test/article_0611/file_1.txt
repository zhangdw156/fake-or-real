## A Stellar Dance: HARPS Unveils Earth's Celestial Secrets Through Lunar Eclipse

The cosmos whispers secrets as ancient and grand as "Starman," David Bowie himself sings. And just like our earthly traveler in the song's iconic chorus, **"there is a starman waiting on the stage, in that silent sky,"**  the HARPS instrument has revealed the fascinating journey of Earth transiting the Sun, an opportunity to study exoplanet atmospheres with unprecedented precision.

Think of the transit effect like a celestial dance: **exoplanets block our view of their host star, but we can still analyze the light they cast.** This requires a level of precision so high it's as if Bowie whispered "We can be heroes" across the universe itself.  And just as "heroes don't always wear capes," space telescopes like those in orbit stand ready to illuminate this hidden dance with unmatched clarity. 

But **sometimes, we need a closer look**. That’s why HARPS turned its instrument upon Earth's transit as it crossed through the Sun. Imagine peering through the thin veil of shadow cast by the Moon, a tiny reflection revealing a planetary journey on an otherwise bright canvas of light –  and that's exactly what HARPS accomplished in this groundbreaking experiment!

**The study of Rossiter-McLaughlin effect**, which measures the star’s wobble due to Earth's passage.  This technique allows us to glean information on the composition and atmospheric features of exoplanets, much like we use a telescope to analyze the night sky. 

HARPS, through its ingenuity, even managed to mimic the "star-crossed lovers" from Bowie's song in their own way by studying reflected moonlight during the penumbral phases of a lunar eclipse! It's a testament to the power of observation and a step towards understanding our cosmic neighbors across the vast tapestry of space.
