The astronomical community agrees that it is crucial to develop instrument concepts early in the design phase of a new telescope. Instruments link the photon-collector, no matter how advanced, to the project's scientific objectives. Instrument studies explore the telescope’s interface and operations and confirm whether the desired scientific observations can be achieved with practical and affordable instruments. This approach was taken by the VLT project, which created an instrumentation plan nearly ten years before it became operational. For OWL, ESO initiated eight instrument concept studies in 2004 in partnership with various European institutions. The selection of initial instrument concepts was guided by the Science Case for the European ELT developed within the OPTICON Network and by early studies on the OWL scientific objectives. The chosen instruments provide a variety of imaging and spectroscopic observing modes and cover different wavelengths from blue to submillimeter. They represent the various operation modes of OWL and effectively test the telescope’s ultimate capabilities. However, this sample does not include all the potentially unique observations that an ELT like OWL can perform. High-resolution spectroscopy in the near-infrared and astrometry at the diffraction limit are two scientifically significant modes not included in this phase. Six studies were led by principal investigators from different European institutions, and two were managed by ESO. The instrument study teams were tasked with identifying specific scientific objectives, defining requirements, developing an instrument concept, and evaluating its performance with OWL. They also needed to compare their concepts to the expected capabilities of major planned ground-based and space-borne facilities, such as ALMA and the JWST. They were required to consider the impact of telescope diameters ranging from 50 to 100 meters and identify any critical aspects related to the telescope interface. They also needed to highlight critical cost factors or required technical developments. Over 150 astronomers and engineers from more than 20 institutes across seven European countries actively participated in this initial effort on potential OWL instruments. Through this process, they familiarized themselves with ELT concepts and developed early opto-mechanical solutions for the instruments. For many involved, this was their first exposure to the vast capabilities of a 100-meter aperture telescope and the differences compared to the 10-meter class telescopes they typically work with. All showed enthusiasm for this new challenge. The eight studies were completed within a year.
