Tom later began working at MPIfR with the new 100 m radio telescope at Effelsberg in Germany. With the 100 m telescope, Tom shifted from researching H ii regions to observing molecular clouds, primarily focusing on the centimetre wavelength lines of ammonia and formaldehyde. Most of Tom’s students were trained in molecular line observations connected to star formation. He continued to study recombination lines from H ii regions, and one of his notable projects was collaborating with Robert Rood to detect the hyperfine line of ionized 3He. Bernard Burke noted that large radio telescopes became Tom’s focus, and he contributed to the setup of major radio telescopes that operated from centimetre to short sub-millimetre wavelengths, such as the Effelsberg 100 m telescope, the Institut de Radio Astronomie Millimetrique 30 m at Pico Veleta, and the 10 m Heinrich Hertz telescope at Mt. Graham. Tom’s students will always remember his readiness to observe or commission receivers and backends at the 100 m telescope. He typically responded, “We will take the telescope time, please sign up for the Dienstwagen to go to Effelsberg.” In recent years, Tom has played a significant role in the establishment of ALMA in key positions at ESO. The workshop included various technical and scientific presentations about ALMA's potential.
