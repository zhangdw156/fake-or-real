Tom later joined MPIfR and began working with the new 100 m radio telescope at Effelsberg in Germany. With this telescope, Tom shifted his focus from studying H ii regions to observing molecular clouds, primarily looking at the centimetre wavelength lines of ammonia and formaldehyde. Most of Tom’s students were trained in molecular line observations connected to star formation. He continued to study recombination lines from H ii regions, and one of his notable projects was collaborating with Robert Rood to detect the hyperfine line of ionized 3He. Bernard Burke noted that large radio telescopes became Tom’s specialty, and he contributed to the commissioning of major radio telescopes that operated from centimetre to short sub-millimetre wavelengths, such as the 100 m telescope at Effelsberg, the 30 m Institut de Radio Astronomie Millimetrique at Pico Veleta, and the 10 m Heinrich Hertz telescope at Mt. Graham. All of Tom’s students will remember him as always being ready to observe or commission equipment at the 100 m telescope. His usual response in these situations was, “We will take the telescope time, please sign up for the Dienstwagen to go to Effelsberg.” In recent years, Tom has played a significant role in the development of ALMA in key positions at ESO. The workshop continued with technical and scientific presentations on ALMA’s potential.
