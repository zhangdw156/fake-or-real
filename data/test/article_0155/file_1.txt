To ensure fair access and usage across different surveys within this scientific collaboration (Consortium Participating), specific guidelines apply:
Community Survey Membership: Limited initially based on original proposal participants plus up to 15 additional specialists if needed based on specific skills lacking within already existing team composition (Science team).
Survey Overlap: Target areas must have maximum overlap between Consortium Community surveys limited at 20. Both teams then share allocated fiber hours for overlapping regions contributing towards overall research goals efficiently despite potential overlaps between survey efforts (Consortium community). All resulting datasets are accessible across all participating science team members while limitations exist regarding how research projects can leverage these datasets - specifically requiring approval from ESO before implementation . Certain restrictions might apply depending upon project alignment (overlap) against existing PhD projects or core scientific work carried out by certain survey teams whose participation isn't part initial proposal submission process.. Detailed rules enforced through an official code conduct document upon publication alongside call for proposals which outlines general principles governing such collaboration activities; hence applicants implicitly agree upon compliance once submitting proposals..
Non-participating surveys operate independently from consortium efforts:
Target Overlap: Maximum allowed target overlap between non-participating surveys remains at 30 compared against others; therefore duplication amongst them needs careful consideration due lack coordination mechanism among different survey efforts.. Non-participating surveys maintain complete autonomy over membership policy related aspects like accessing data sets as well as publishing findings without direct involvement from consortium partners .
