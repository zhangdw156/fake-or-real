The research team needs established rules about how they can use each other's collected fruits (data) fairly so everyone gets value from their work together (investment).
There's space for community groups (called "Community Survey") who can join if they bring unique skills; no more than 15 extra people can join each group if needed
Both research teams need equal access fruit from one another; however overlapping fruit between them must have cost sharing so everyone gets what they need out it!
All fruits collected are shared amongst everyone on this team but every piece must go through them first before being used!
There are rules about using this fruit once it starts being processed which apply everywhere - even within individual projects - especially ones where someone else already has some control over it!
The full details about these rules are expected along side code conduct document once applications start rolling into them! If you submit an application you agree you'll follow these rules too
For non-research groups we don't expect much sharing except maybe some overlap. These groups get special treatment since there isnt much coordination between them anyway . They get free rein over how they structure things like who joins their groupaccessingpublishing papers etc..
