Farthest Known Gamma-Ray Burst  
A team of Italian astronomers used the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to observe the afterglow of the most distant Gamma-ray burst known, with a measured redshift of 6.3. Guido Chincarini from INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera and the University of Milano-Bicocca, who led the study, noted, “This means it is also one of the brightest Gamma-ray bursts ever seen.” Its luminosity is so immense that it probably released 300 times more energy in just a few minutes than the Sun will emit over its entire lifespan of 10 billion years. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are brief flashes of high-energy gamma rays lasting from less than a second to several minutes. These bursts release vast amounts of energy in a short time, making them the most powerful events since the Big Bang. It is generally accepted that most gamma-ray bursts occur due to the explosion of very massive, evolved stars that collapse into black holes. The Gamma-ray burst GRB050904 was first detected on September 4, 2005, by the NASA/ASI/PPARC Swift satellite, which is focused on identifying these powerful explosions. Following this detection, astronomers around the world sought to identify the source by looking for its afterglow in visible and near-infrared light. The Italian team observed the object in near-infrared with ISAAC and in visible light with FORS2 on the VLT. By comparing the brightness of the source across different observing bands, they determined its redshift and thus its distance. Angelo Antonelli, another team member, remarked that “the redshift we calculated has since been corroborated by spectroscopic observations from another team using the Subaru telescope.” The accompanying figure shows the brightness of the Gamma-ray burst GRB 050904 as recorded with FORS2 and ISAAC across various filters. The ESO filter bandpasses are overlaid, along with the best-fitting template that helped the astronomers measure the photometric redshift. The noticeable decrease in flux in the I-band, compared to the others, indicates its high-redshift nature.
