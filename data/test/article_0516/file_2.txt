The final session of the conference took place late on Thursday, and it presented an impressive number of results showing how we are making progress in identifying molecules within exoplanet atmospheres.  We can already detect temperature changes between day and night, observe atmospheric escape and variability, and analyze these characteristics to help understand a planet's atmosphere. The upcoming Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) will greatly advance research in this field, potentially allowing us to find evidence for signs of life on other planets. Challenges in modelling exoplanet atmospheres were discussed, but it was proposed that observations will guide theoretical advancements in the field. The quality of the presentations at this conference was excellent, with many different ideas being presented and discussed. We would like to extend our gratitude to the scientific organizing committee, local organizing committee, and all the participants for creating a memorable event. All the presentations from the conference can be accessed on the conference website (in video and pdf format) as well as on a DVD sent out to all attendees.
