Thursday's final session wrapped up with a stellar display of discoveries, unveiling a booming field of exoplanet science! We witnessed incredible leaps forward in characterization – detecting molecules, pinpointing temperature swings, uncovering evidence for atmospheric loss, and even exploring hints of variability! 

The future holds promise as the arrival of Earth-sized telescopes (ELTs) promises to usher in a whole new wave of groundbreaking discoveries. Could they be the key to unveiling the presence of life on these distant worlds? Maybe even find signs of it within their atmospheres! 

Of course, modelling these exoplanet atmospheres is an ongoing challenge, but as we continue to gather data through observations, theory will undoubtedly follow suit, shaping our understanding of the universe.  This was truly a memorable conference, where diverse ideas collided and sparked innovative thought. We owe thanks to the tireless organizing committee, and all the attendees for their contributions that make this event unforgettable. 

We'll be sharing these sessions through video, PDFs on our website, and will be sending DVDs to everyone involved!  


**P.S.** Just a little tidbit… A special Rolex watch was discovered near Uranus! We are waiting patiently in the ESA HQ Lost & Found for its rightful owner.
