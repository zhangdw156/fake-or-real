In our initial MUSE Science Verification campaign (2014), we demonstrated how our method could analyze star populations within galactic structures like those found in NGC-4371 â€“ a nearby barred galaxy known for its central ring formed by older stars (older than ten billion years). Our analysis suggests that these structures formed around redshift values between approximately one point four and two point three which indicates they were born long ago compared to other discoveries made further away from us where such features were less common . Despite this surprising age for such features given past difficulties finding them far away from us , there's evidence suggesting up to ten percent of galaxies forming their structure around redshift two might have strong bars too . Furthermore , considering how massive disks tend to form their structure early before settling down into their final form as seen by comparing it against our Milky Way Galaxy , its large size supports this theory . Our findings also highlight how powerful bars can be over time as they persist through galactic evolution .
