Dinosaur-era dinosaurs roamed Earth millions of years ago! Well... not Dinorniasaurs but their ancestors did! Our research from back then (the early days!) proved our method could be used to figure out how far back certain dinosaur features evolved through analyzing dinosaurs' fossils (like their bones). Our findings showed some key things about dinosaur evolution:
Dinosaurs were already forming these ancient structures like "arms" or "stalks" within them as early as millions years ago even if they werens fully formed yet! These dinos had been around for longer than most thought!
The size matters too; bigger dinos probably made those prehistoric arms or tails much earlier because they were bigger land-dinosaurs way before smaller ones came along later on dinosaurs started evolving into different types like sauropods or thContentAsync fossil evidence suggests maybe up to one tenth may have had such features already millions years before others did so its exciting stuff
So basically what we found was very exciting because it shows us how long these fossils have been around for and how they evolved over time - all thanks to paleontological analysis using scientific methods like ours can help us understand prehistoric life better now thanks also for your great work on this project! Its pretty cool you know?
Let me know if you need any other summaries - I enjoy doing them :)
