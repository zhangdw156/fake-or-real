The precise measurement of ten southern Galactic Cepheid stars using the HARPS spectrograph on the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla has enabled a detailed study of their atmospheric dynamics and nearby surroundings. These findings impact the cosmic distance scale calibration and suggest that the Milky Way's rotation may be more straightforward than previously believed. Nevertheless, fully understanding the impact of spectral line asymmetries requires the development of specific models. Since Henrietta Leavitt identified their distinct characteristics in 1908, Cepheids have served as distance indicators to explore our Galaxy's structure and measure the Universe's expansion. When used alongside velocity measurements, Cepheids provide essential insights into the Milky Way's rotation. The HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale heavily depended on Cepheids for calibrating long-distance measurement methods and determining the Hubble constant. However, accurately measuring the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) remains the main source of uncertainty in using Cepheids as standard candles. This distance establishes the foundational Cepheid periodâ€“luminosity relationship and introduces significant uncertainty in building the cosmic distance ladder. Investigating the dynamic structures of Cepheids' atmospheres and their surroundings is crucial for refining the Milky Way's rotation understanding and enhancing the distance scale. Achieving these objectives requires high signal-to-noise (S/N), high spectral resolution, and multi-epoch spectroscopic observations of Cepheids.
