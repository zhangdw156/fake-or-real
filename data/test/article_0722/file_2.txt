The use of precise spectroscopic measurements of ten southern Galactic Cepheid stars taken by the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) on the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla has led to a thorough examination of how their atmospheres operate and their immediate surroundings. These findings have implications for how we calibrate the cosmic distance scale and suggest that the Milky Way’s rotation may be less complex than earlier believed. Still, fully understanding the impact of spectral line asymmetries necessitates the creation of specific models. Since Henrietta Leavitt identified their distinct characteristics in 1908, Cepheid stars have been utilized to measure distances, contributing to our understanding of the structure of our Galaxy and the Universe’s expansion. When velocity data is included, Cepheids are also instrumental in studying the Milky Way's rotation. Recently, the HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale heavily depended on Cepheids for calibrating extensive distance measurement methods and calculating the Hubble constant. However, the main source of uncertainty when using Cepheids as distance markers comes from accurately measuring the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which informs the Cepheid period-luminosity relation and represents the largest uncertainty in establishing the cosmic distance ladder. Investigating Cepheids’ dynamic atmospheric structure and their nearby environment is crucial for making accurate predictions about the Milky Way’s rotation and enhancing the distance scale ladder. To accomplish these objectives, detailed observations of Cepheids with high signal-to-noise ratios, high spectral resolution, and taken over multiple times are necessary.
