In the 30 Doradus star cluster, a luminous object called R139 (VFTS 527; its brightness being V approximately 12) has been identified as potentially one of the most massive stars outside of another similar star named R136. 

Research from 2002 by Virpi Niemela suggested that "the brightest star in each open cluster is (at least) a binary." Her suggestion is supported by data gathered using the VFTS, which reveals that R139 is actually a double-lined binary system comprising two luminous supergiants classified as O6.5 Iafc and O6 Iaf for the primary and secondary respectively. 

This discovery was only possible due to high-quality multi-epoch spectra obtained by VFTS. Although these data can detect binarity, more detailed characterization of orbital parameters would require additional spectroscopy to determine periods and amplitudes. After observation with a variety of telescopes (e.g., MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope, Magellan, and the VLT), the orbit of R139 is highly eccentric with a period of 153.9 days. This research led to lower mass limits for the components of M1 sin cubed i equals 78 ± 8 solar masses and M2 sin cubed i equals 66 ± 7 solar masses, making R139 one of the most massive binary systems known and the only one containing two O-type supergiants. Mass estimates from evolutionary models are in good agreement with these lower limits. These results suggest a large inclination angle for the system, which could lead to photometric eclipses.  A monitoring programme has been conducted where 54 V-band images were taken with the Faulkes Telescope South over an 18-month period, but no evidence of photometric variations was observed. An extensive photometric study near to the predicted periastron would provide conclusive evidence for an eclipse and give valuable constraints on the inclination of the system.
