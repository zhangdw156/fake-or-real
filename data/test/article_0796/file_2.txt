To create appropriate recommendations, a questionnaire was designed in English to gather the views of visitors and employees regarding their experiences at high altitude. This questionnaire was made available to all visitors and workers at the ALMA and APEX sites, with 28 responses received. The first section collects work-related background information. Participants are asked about their frequency of high-altitude exposure and their preparations for such conditions. They can also mention any unusual incidents at high-altitude work settings and whether they experienced any work-related limitations possibly due to altitude (e.g., “Did you face any restrictions in planning and coordination?”). This serves as an introduction to potential risk areas, which are explored further in the second part of section one. Here, participants indicate the degree to which they encountered 17 physical and psychological issues on a scale from 1 = extremely to 5 = not at all (e.g., feelings like anger or irritability). The third section of the first part asks participants to evaluate the effects of high altitude on their abilities, work behavior, and performance, using a scale from 1 = strongly impaired to 5 = strongly improved (e.g., ability item: “Perceptual speed: the ability to quickly and accurately compare information”; work behavior item: “Driving a car”; performance item: “Job performance capability”). This final section aims to assess potential performance issues at high altitude. 

The second part of the questionnaire focuses on occupational safety and health (OSH) programs and their perceived effectiveness. In the first section of part two, participants are asked to list all safety-related resources they utilized and any other support (e.g., “Briefing by Supervisor”) that helped them prepare for high-altitude work. They are also asked to estimate the time spent on each resource and how beneficial they found them for high-altitude tasks. In the second section, participants describe and rate the document or support they found most beneficial. The third part includes a “Performance and Well-being Diary” with three tables. The first table allows participants to assess their average daily workload before, during, and after their mission, while the second table addresses how that workload was managed. The third table records well-being before, during, and after the mission. So far, this last section of the returned questionnaires has not been thoroughly completed and will be addressed in a future report.
