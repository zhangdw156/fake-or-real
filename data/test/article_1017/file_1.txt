The Spanish research and development system has over 500 professional astronomers, including PhD students. More than 350 of these astronomers have completed their PhDs and are involved in independent research. Approximately half of them hold permanent positions at universities and research centers. They are supported by around 150 technical staff dedicated to astronomy, working in about 30 locations across Spain. The workforce for astronomical research is approximately equally divided between university departments and research centers. In recent years, the process of training new PhD students in astronomy has picked up speed, with about 25 new astronomy PhDs earned each year, a number that could be increasing. Currently, the Ministry of Education and Science is funding 20 to 25 PhD fellowships in astronomy and space science, in addition to various fellowships provided by regional governments, universities, and research centers. Research in all areas of astronomy is being pursued. A 2001 study by the Spanish Astronomical Society indicated that Spain is slightly stronger than other European countries in studies of stars and the Milky Way but somewhat weaker in extragalactic solar system research. Similarly, while Spanish astronomers count more on optical observations than their European counterparts, they show comparatively less strength in high-energy and laboratory astrophysics. Overall, Spain has about 12 professional astronomers per million people, which trails the superconducting number for countries like France and Germany (16 to 18) and is roughly half that of the United Kingdom. There are hopes that significant funding increases in R&D by the Spanish government will bring Spain closer to average European levels in the next decade.
