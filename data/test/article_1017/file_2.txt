The Spanish research and development system has over 500 professional astronomers, including PhD students. More than 350 of these have completed their PhDs and conduct independent research. Approximately half of these PhD astronomers hold permanent positions at universities and research centers. They are supported by around 150 technical staff dedicated to astronomy, working in about 30 locations across Spain. The workforce in astronomy is roughly evenly split between university departments that conduct both research and teaching and research centers. In recent years, training for new PhD students in astronomy has been active, with about 25 new PhDs awarded annually, a number that may be increasing. Currently, the Ministry of Education and Science funds 20-25 PhD fellowships in astronomy and space science, in addition to other fellowships from regional governments, universities, and research centers. Research in all areas of astronomy is being conducted. A 2001 study for the Spanish Astronomical Society indicated that Spain performs slightly better than other European countries in studying stars and the Galaxy, but is slightly behind in extragalactic astronomy, cosmology, and Solar System science. In terms of research tools, Spanish astronomers rely more on optical observations compared to other European nations, while showing less strength in high-energy (X-ray and Gamma-ray) and laboratory astrophysics. Overall, Spain has about 12 professional astronomers per million inhabitants, which is lower than the 16 to 18 in countries like France and Germany, and half of the number in the United Kingdom. Recent significant annual increases in the Spanish government's R&D budget suggest that Spain may align more closely with European averages in the next decade.
