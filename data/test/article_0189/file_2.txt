ESO has made significant progress in developing efficient data processing tools for its telescopes. While initial pipelines were rudimentary before being refined over time through collaboration with experts in their field; the focus now shifts towards better documentation including video tutorials on key processes as well as cookbooks detailing essential steps; and bug reporting systems designed for user feedback . This ongoing improvement process starts anew whenever new instruments are commissioned thanks to close communication within its user base; making these procedures more effective over time . However , maintaining consistent pipeline functionality across various instruments due to their diverse configurations remains challenging due to limitations in resource allocation ; particularly when shared resources need integration into external software applications ; especially given these challenges require constant attention from researchers working on multiple projects simultaneously . A notable issue arises from this diversity in user skill levels , where there's an evident distinction between those who require specialized expertise versus those who need simpler guidance which requires dedicated efforts by institutions like UC which support workshops catered towards both novice expert users through educational programs such as interferometry schools designed specifically for this purpose . Additionally , last year saw them establish Expertise Centres dedicated specifically for assisting researchers using VLTI by providing guidance on proposal submission alongside technical assistance regarding data analysis interpretation using this system .
