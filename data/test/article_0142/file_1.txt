Since space radiation can be absorbed by water vapor in Earth's atmosphere when it's observed using submillimeter wavelengths (a type of light), astronomers need very dry locations for their observations. The Chajnantor plateau near Chile's Andes Mountains stands out as a prime location because its dryness allows for clear observation even with this specific type of light. Here we find facilities like APEX and ALMA that utilize advanced instruments optimized for detecting celestial objects using infrared light from specific points within their spectrum that pass through relatively undisturbed air better than others do due to less interference from atmospheric absorption or scattering effects caused by moisture or dust particles present within our atmosphere on Earth; this helps researchers study distant objects like stars or planets emitting infrared signals that are difficult enough but worth studying because they give us valuable information about them!
