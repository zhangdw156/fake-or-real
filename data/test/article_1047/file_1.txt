You and Your Observatory â€” The ESO Users Committee

The European Southern Observatory (ESO) is an international organization that supports a broad scientific community. Funded by its member states, it offers access to its facilities for all professional astronomers globally. ESO and its users collaborate to enhance scientific advancement: ESO provides the required infrastructure and support while users conduct valuable measurements and publish promptly in respected journals. The Users Committee (UC) serves as an advisory group that links users and ESO. Now a respected entity, its 33rd meeting occurred on 27 and 28 April 2009 at ESO Headquarters in Garching. Some view it as a forum for users to express their opinions about ESO, but it also serves ESO, allowing it to inform users and, increasingly, gather user feedback on various initiatives. I believe that the UC's role is to foster collaboration between ESO and its users, with most interactions ideally occurring naturally outside of UC settings.
