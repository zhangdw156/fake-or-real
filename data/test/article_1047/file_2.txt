You and Your Observatory â€” The ESO Users Committee

The European Southern Observatory (ESO) is an international organization that supports a large scientific community. Funded by its member states, it offers its facilities to professional astronomers worldwide. ESO and its users work together to enhance scientific progress: ESO supplies the infrastructure and logistical support, while users conduct significant research and publish their findings in reputable journals. The Users Committee (UC) serves as an advisory group that connects users with ESO. Now a well-established body, it held its 33rd annual meeting on 27 and 28 April 2009 at ESO Headquarters in Garching. Some view it as a platform for users to express their opinions about ESO, but it is also a venue for ESO to relay information to users and to seek their feedback on various initiatives. I believe the role of the UC is to promote collaboration between ESO and its users, with most interactions ideally happening naturally outside of the UC.
