The Integral Field Spectroscopy Wiki  
Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) is a well-established field, with IFS instruments available at major optical telescope facilities worldwide, including advanced equipment on the VLT. However, many in the astronomical community still shy away from IFS due to concerns about the complexities of handling, processing, and analyzing the data. While IFS data is indeed more complex than regular imaging or long-slit spectroscopy, many challenges could be easily addressed by leveraging the experiences of others. To promote the sharing of IFS knowledge, a community-driven repository has been created, containing information, tips, codes, tools, references, and more, which can be accessed and edited by everyone. The wiki is designed for IFS beginners seeking help with their data and for experienced users who can share tips, insights about specific instruments, and code contributions.
