The Integral Field Spectroscopy Wiki  
Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) is a well-established field, with IFS instruments available at major optical telescope facilities worldwide, including advanced equipment on the VLT. However, many in the astronomical community hesitate to use IFS because they find handling, analyzing, and reducing IFS data challenging. While working with IFS data is undoubtedly more complex than with regular imaging or long-slit spectroscopy, many challenges could be easily addressed through shared knowledge. To improve collaboration on IFS information, resources such as tips, codes, tools, and references are consolidated into a community-accessible and editable repository. This wiki is meant to support beginners with questions about IFS data and invites seasoned users to share tips and experiences related to specific instruments.
