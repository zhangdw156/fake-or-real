The formation of massive stars has been a key focus in Tom's work, and ALMA will deliver images with the necessary detail and sensitivity to investigate both stellar clusters and individual stars within them. Several presentations addressed topics ranging from molecular excitation in massive star-forming areas to characteristics of hot cores linked to intermediate mass protostars in clusters. Karl Menten summarized findings from imaging maser emissions from various molecular types in massive star-forming regions. Al Wootten reported on high-resolution imaging of water masers and thermal emissions from other molecules, emphasizing the critical role of ALMA's longest baselines in using maser emissions to identify small-scale structures in these areas. Mayra Osorio shared model forecasts for dust and molecular emissions from high-mass protostars, while Carlos Carrasco Gonzalez displayed recent interferometric images of molecular outflows and disks in the NGC 2071 star cluster. Izaskun Jimenez-Serra presented high-resolution images of the Cep A HW2 region, showing ongoing formation of a cluster of intermediate mass stars. Dan Jaffe and James Moran discussed studies of H ii regions, with Dan showing kinematic observations in compact and ultracompact H ii regions using the [Ne ii] emission line at 12.8 Âµm, revealing inconsistencies with predictions of high-velocity movement of exciting stars; instead, a disc geometry better explains the evolution of very young H ii regions. Jim Moran presented SMA observations of the recombination line maser in MWC 349, noting that the disc's kinematics around this young massive star do not fully align with Keplerian rotation. Despite MWC 349's location far north, ALMA can produce images with sufficient resolution to distinguish between kinetic disturbances from gas spiraling toward the star and gas expelled from the star's disc.
