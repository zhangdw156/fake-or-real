Oumuamua's surprising features include significant fluctuations in brightness despite being exposed mainly from one side during observation (suggesting variations across different areas). This suggests an elongated shape between ten times longer than wide â€“ implying potential differences depending on how we view from different angles due to unknown rotations axes . Its light curve doesn't provide information about its depth but suggests complex rotations leading us towards two fundamental periods - one shorter than another - likely related to either elongated cigar shape or oblate spheroid configuration . These configurations possibly correspond with minimalmaximum rotational energy levels respectively . Considering Oumuamuas known properties like dark surface albedo suggest sizes ranging from hundreds meters wide for cigarshaped forms up to tens meters wide for pancake shapes based on calculations . Further investigation into these theories requires additional observations as they may help us understand how much cohesion Oumuamua possesses , as gravitational forces alone might not hold such objects together if they were truly pancakes shaped , requiring some internal strength.
