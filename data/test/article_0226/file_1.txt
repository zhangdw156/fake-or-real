Stargazing investigations revealed unexpected changes in light intensity from "brown dwarf." This suggests significant shifts between star shapes - star's length can change up to ten times depending on how we observe them - potentially confirming theories about how they rotate around their own center point(s). While previous assumptions suggested they might look like colorful cigars due their consistent star shape arrangements (like our sun), further observation showed these are likely false as they seem far too rigid for such forms while also being very unstable compared with other known celestial bodies stargazing investigations have seen before . These findings confirm their unique nature as well as complexities surrounding them , guiding us toward looking deeper into what these phenomena truly are . We must consider whether there was ever any form or life on these bodies etc...
