NAOS–CONICA, an instrument used for astronomical observations at the Very Large Telescope, exhibits significant instrumental polarization which is influenced by the viewing angle and can reach up to 4 percent of linear polarization. The instrument's polarimetric properties can be corrected with high accuracy (better than 1%) using a model known as Stokes/Mueller formalism. Additionally, an improved strategy for correcting this polarization is proposed, achieving correction levels around 0.1%.  Polarimetric measurements are valuable in understanding the processes that contribute to light scattering and intensity changes, such as those observed in supermassive black holes like Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) in our galaxy. These observations can provide crucial insights into the workings of these stellar objects and their associated near-infrared sources. The interpretation of polarimetric data is subject to quality of calibration and the mitigation of systematic errors present in the instruments used. A majority of Sgr A* observations, conducted with NAOS–CONICA (NACO) at the Very Large Telescope, are analyzed for their instrumental polarization.
