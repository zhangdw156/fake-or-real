## Poland's Breakthrough in Polarimetric Astronomy

**Polish ingenuity shines:** NAOS–CONICA, a landmark instrument at the Very Large Telescope in Chile, has showcased a remarkable breakthrough in polarimetry – specifically, its ability to precisely measure the polarization of light. The instrument's sensitivity shines even brighter than expected. 

This is no ordinary feat!  The degree of linear polarisation on NAOS–CONICA reaches up to **4%** with a detailed model predicting an accuracy of over **1%** for correction. An even more remarkable improvement in accuracy – about **0.1%** – is anticipated through a new observation strategy specifically designed to mitigate the impact of instrumental polarization effects. 

Polarimetry delivers valuable insights into radiative processes, providing a crucial complement to total intensity observations like those of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) – the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy.  Sgr A*, however, remains a challenging target where interpretation of data depends on rigorous calibration and understanding instrumental systematics. 

To date, the majority of polarimetric observations of Sgr A* were conducted with NAOS–CONICA (NACO), a breakthrough instrument itself!  **This study delves into the detailed analysis of NAOS-CONICA's instrumental polarization**, offering unprecedented insights for researchers around the world. The full numerical details can be found in Witzel et al. (2010).
