The Galactic survey project called "Orion" focuses on studying star formation and planets.  It targets a specific area (30 square degrees) within the Orion Belt, measuring it using all VISTA filters to study young stars and their surrounding environment. The region has many stellar clusters of different ages: from newly forming clusters to more mature ones, including some associated with giant molecular clouds where stars are currently being formed.  The project aims to identify and measure objects (with masses as low as 12 Jupiter masses) within this area to study the young star populations. It will also investigate how environmental effects might influence the very low-mass end of the initial mass function, which is a way to understand the distribution of stellar masses that form when stars are born. This information can help scientists better understand the origins and processes of different kinds of stars and planets.
