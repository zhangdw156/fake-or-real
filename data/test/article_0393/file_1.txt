Using our programs, we conducted a complete data reduction process. This allowed us to investigate whether the numerous but controversial observations of magnetic fields in a wide variety of stars were accurate and reproducible using the best methods we tested. Our findings indicated that uncertainties could be as much as 30% larger than those predicted by standard statistics alone. We discovered that most reported detections based on single field measurements, often relying on just three to five sigma significance levels, were inaccurate. Some FORS1 field discoveries, typically those with higher significance levels, were confirmed. This includes confirmations in white dwarfs (WD0446-789 and WD2359-434) and β Cep star ξ1 CMa. However, reports that many pulsating B stars, classical Be stars, normal B stars, O stars, and HgMn peculiar B stars possess weak magnetic fields were not supported.  Similarly, we could not confirm any field detections in Herbig Ae/Be stars. Our investigation into spurious results, as well as systematic examination of the large number of magnetic field measurements conducted on magnetic Ap stars, helped us understand their strengths and limitations. In general, our findings indicate that FORS measurements of individual stars exhibit internal consistency at levels expected from the uncertainties we derived using our programs. However, there are occasional measurements that deviate significantly from these expectations by a few sigma. We call these inconsistent results "occasional outliers" and we have found that they occur in a few percent of measurements. Therefore, field discoveries based solely on single measurements with a significance level of 4 to 5 sigma cannot be considered as definitive findings.
