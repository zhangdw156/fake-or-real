OPTIMOSâ€“EVE is designed to observe celestial objects at the E-ELT telescope's Nasmyth focus using a fiber positioner that allows up to 240 individual targets to be studied within an area of view spanning greater than or equal to 7 arcminutes.  This capability allows the combination of the fibers into larger units for integral field observations. The instrument has been carefully calibrated and designed to handle sources ranging in size from very small (e.g., unresolved stars) to large ones (e.g., extended galaxies, exceeding 10 arcseconds). For point sources, the aperture has been optimized to a size of 0.9 arcseconds; integral field units are matched to galaxy sizes beyond 1 redshift. The fiber/positioner approach eliminates flexure issues related to larger field-of-view observations that can exceed two meters in diameter. To achieve a high spectral resolution necessary for observing faint, distant objects in the near infrared, a spectral resolving power of at least 5000 is essential.  This allows spectral regions unaffected by strong hydroxyl skylines to be captured. The wavelength range covered within each spectrum (ranging from lambda/3 to lambda/6 in the visible to lambda/10 to lambda/20 in the near infrared) involves trade-offs between spectral resolution, the number of wavelengths that can be observed, and detector cost. It is important to address sky correction challenges in observational astronomy, especially for faint objects within reach of the E-ELT.  Though traditional fiber-fed spectrographs may face difficulties with sky corrections, a large number of dedicated sky fibers will sample temporal variations across the entire field of view to overcome these limitations. The instrument incorporates a focal plate carousel and two dual-beam visible/near-infrared optimized spectrographs. The spectrographs employ volume phase holographic gratings in their first order for optimal performance.  The design utilizes established technologies based on FLAMES/GIRAFFE and X-shooter, creating a robust instrument that can be developed, manufactured, and integrated with existing infrastructure.
