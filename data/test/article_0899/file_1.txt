Over thirty crates containing optics, electronics, mechanics, and various hardware and software for the Phase Referenced Imaging and Microarcsecond Astrometry (PRIMA) instrument arrived at Cerro Paranal in mid-July from ESO Garching, marking the start of the PRIMA Big Bang. This assembly, integration, and verification phase—commonly referred to as “the Big Bang”—lasted seven weeks. Teams of engineers and scientists from ESO Garching and ESO Paranal worked in multiple shifts around the clock to assemble this complex instrument, managing limited lab space, subsystem availability, and sky time without interfering with one another. Two weeks after the initial shipment, an additional 18 crates were sent from our PRIMA partners at the Geneva Observatory, along with staff from Geneva and MPIA Heidelberg. In total, more than 30 people were involved in the intricate process of assembling optical instruments in a space no larger than the lobby of ESO Garching. A shared sense of purpose and camaraderie kept the momentum going as we worked long hours to complete over eight years of PRIMA development. By early September 2008, individual subsystems had been unboxed, installed, and tested, while the larger system integration was being contemplated. In the final days of the PRIMA Big Bang, two of the VLTI's auxiliary telescopes (ATs) were directed toward the sky, using 1.8 m apertures to channel light from a single star through the optical beam trains, delay lines, and into one of PRIMA's fringe sensor units (FSUs). On September 3, 2008, slightly ahead of the ambitious schedule, beams of light from HD 19349 were combined in FSU A, and an interference pattern was observed as the delay lines moved through the equal path length position for each aperture. Within a few days, this essential part of the PRIMA system not only detected fringes from significantly fainter stars, but also managed to lock onto and actively track them. At the same time, the PRIMA laser metrology system was successfully operated across a 300 m optical path, from the interferometry laboratory to two ATs and back.
