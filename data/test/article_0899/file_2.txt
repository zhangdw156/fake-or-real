Over thirty crates containing optics, electronics, mechanics, and various hardware and software for the Phase Referenced Imaging and Microarcsecond Astrometry (PRIMA) instrument arrived at Cerro Paranal in mid-July from ESO Garching, marking the start of the PRIMA Big Bang. This assembly, integration, and verification phase—commonly referred to as “the Big Bang”—lasted seven weeks. Teams of engineers and scientists from ESO Garching and ESO Paranal worked in multiple shifts around the clock to assemble the complex instrument, managing limited lab space, subsystem availability, and sky time without interfering with one another. Two weeks after the initial shipment, an additional 18 crates arrived from our PRIMA partners at the Geneva Observatory, accompanied by staff from there and MPIA Heidelberg. Ultimately, over 30 people participated in this meticulously organized effort in a space no bigger than the lobby of ESO Garching. A strong sense of purpose and teamwork carried us through long days and nights as we approached the culmination of more than eight years of PRIMA development. By early September 2008, individual subsystems had been unpacked, installed, and tested, while consideration began for the overall system integration. In the final days of the PRIMA Big Bang, two of the VLTI’s auxiliary telescopes (ATs) were pointed at the sky, using the 1.8 m apertures to direct light from a single star into one of PRIMA's fringe sensor units (FSUs) through the optical beam trains and delay lines. On September 3, 2008—just ahead of the ambitious Big Bang schedule—twin beams of starlight from HD 19349 were combined in FSU A, and the distinct interference pattern appeared as the delay lines adjusted to equal path lengths for each aperture. Within a few days, this vital part of the PRIMA system was not only detecting fringes from much fainter stars, but also managed to lock onto and actively track them. At the same time, the PRIMA laser metrology system was successfully operated across a 300 m optical path, from the interferometry lab to two ATs and back.
