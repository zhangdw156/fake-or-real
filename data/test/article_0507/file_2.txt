On October 1st, 2015, the Laser Traffic Control System (LTCS) began functioning at the Paranal Observatory as part of the Adaptive Optics Facility (AOF).  The LTCS helps night astronomers plan and execute observations without worrying about possible collisions between the AOF's powerful laser beams and other telescopes with sensitive instruments. 

It provides real-time information on current collisions, predictions for potential collisions, and priority assignment to telescopes when at least one is operating a laser. The LTCS is now integrated into the observatoryâ€™s operational environment, enabling flexible telescope configurations, prioritizing instrument access, and interfacing with ESO's observing tools for both service and visitor mode observations.

The first component of the Adaptive Optics Facility to begin routine operations on October 1st, 2015, was the LTCS-Paranal (also known as LTCS).  It arose from a requirement in 2009 to develop a tool to avoid collisions between lasers and other sensitive instruments when building an observatory with four powerful lasers and many non-laser telescopes.  The LTCS includes software developed both by third parties and by ESO, enabling astronomers to schedule observations without worry about possible laser interference.
