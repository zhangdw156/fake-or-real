This research used data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) telescope on an extremely large galaxy group called El Gordo which was previously discovered using another telescope called ACT . By examining how light bends around this group due its hot gas being heated up by collisions between galaxies within it , they were able confirm that theres something happening inside this group that we can see through light bending . This technique helps us understand how galaxies interact during collisions even when those interactions happen far away . The researchers found evidence that shows shocks caused by these galactic collisions exist within El Gordo's hot gas clouds even though we usually need multiple telescopes working together over long periods so we can get reliable information about these events . The findings demonstrate how valuable it will be for astronomers like them who use telescopes like Alama because they allow us access into things that are normally too faint or difficult for other methods like traditional telescopes .
