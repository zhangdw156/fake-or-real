astronauts have used humanity's cutting edge telescope called Arianne robotic robotic telescope (areso)to look at Earth's giant dust storms called "Earths giant dust storms". This allows us better understand how much mass they hold before they finally land on other planets... A key part was figuring out what kind of winds were blowing around them . . . we found some interesting things about them!
However, there are some limitations:
Limited Data: They needed more than what they had gotten so far... But their amazing discoveries show us just how good this new technology really can be!
As long as we keep pushing forward like this mission will continue inspiring humanity's fascination with Earths giants!
Let me know if you need help understanding any part further! I hope this helps!
