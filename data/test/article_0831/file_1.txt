After briefly discussing the natural history and climate of the ALMA site, as well as the adaptations required for life, which have led to significant extinctions, we can better understand why scientists placed the ALMA complex at a high elevation for advanced terrestrial life, enabling effective searches for molecules related to life on Earth and beyond. We may simply wish that people will have the chance to visit and appreciate the unique natural environment of Chajnantor, even though humans are not fully adapted to activities above 5,000 meters. A more pressing concern is the anticipated loss of many high-altitude species due to global warming in the 21st century. A local temperature increase of about 3.5Â°C could raise vegetation zones by 500 to 600 meters. All meteorological, climatic, and biological factors suggest that the Chajnantor site was ideal for milli-submillimeter astronomy by the end of the 20th century. However, whether these exceptional characteristics will be maintained throughout the 21st century depends on the extent of climate change and shifts in precipitation patterns in the region. Most Global Circulation Models anticipate drought in the Atacama area, while predicting increased moisture and rainfall on the eastern side of the Andes.
