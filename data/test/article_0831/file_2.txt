After briefly reviewing the natural history and climate of the ALMA site, as well as some of the adaptations that led to mass extinctions, we can better understand the seeming contradiction of placing the ALMA complex at altitudes suitable for evolved terrestrial life to effectively search for molecules related to both Earthly and extraterrestrial life. We may simply feel disappointed that we will soon visit and appreciate the unique landscape of Chajnantor, despite humans not being perfectly adapted to heights above 5,000 meters. A more pressing issue is the anticipated extinction of many species native to high altitudes due to global warming in the 21st century. An expected increase of around 3.5 Â°C could push vegetation further up by 500 to 600 meters. All indicators regarding weather, climate, and biology suggest that Chajnantor is the best location for submillimeter astronomy established by the late 20th century. The survival of its exceptional features throughout the 21st century depends on how severe the climate change will be and how precipitation patterns will develop in the region. Most Global Circulation Models anticipate that the Atacama region will become drier while the eastern Andes experience more rain and moisture.
