The near-infrared surface brightness method uses the pulsations of a Cepheid star, which radially expands and contracts, to determine its characteristics.  By analyzing the pulsation patterns in visible and infrared light, we can calculate variations in luminosity and color related to the phase of the pulsation cycle. These data then provide the star's surface brightness and angular diameter as a function of that phase.  This method is supported by interferometric observations of non-pulsating stars and measurements of their angular diameters using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. The radial velocity curve, which reflects the star's pulsational movement, can be used to determine its pulsational velocity curve after applying a projection factor. This factor accounts for how light from a pulsating star is emitted across its entire visible hemisphere, not just where it directly interacts with the observer's line of sight.  Knowing the pulsation velocity allows us to calculate the variation of the stellar radius throughout the cycle. Combining these parameters leads to both the angular diameter variation and the absolute radial velocity variation. This relationship allows for solving equations to determine distance and mean stellar radius.  It shares a similar approach with the Baadeâ€“Wesselink method used for distances in pulsating stars. For our analysis, we plot the angular diameter as a function of the radius variation, fitting the data with the best-fit line for HV877 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We exclude the phase interval between 0.8 and 1.0 when the star contracts, which can cause atmospheric shocks and affect our measurements.  The overall match between the photometric angular diameter and the inferred angular diameter from the radial velocity curve with its best-fit is impressive, except in the aforementioned phase range (between 0.8 and 1.0). A significant advantage of this method is its application to stars in other galaxies, as it can be employed on both nearby and more distant stars. The drawback is that precise light curves at both optical and near-infrared wavelengths are crucial for observing, along with precise radial velocity data, which significantly requires more observation time.
