The Focused ReducerLow Dispersion Spectrograph (FORS2), used alongside other instruments like UVES at ESO's Very Large Telescope array allows us greater accuracy than combining FLAMESUVES would provide when analyzing various elements within globular star systems within our galaxy... This choice was made due to its superior performance at resolving faint details within these systems... We found that using FORS2 yielded results comparable or even slightly better than those obtained by combining FLAMESUVES when determining element composition across multiple stars... This means there's no need for recalibration or adjustments based on potential errors introduced by choosing one instrument over another.. To ensure consistent analysis across different studies involving these stellar populations we compared data derived from both methods... This resulted into an updated compilation encompassing all available data points which can now be accessed publicly..
