FORS2 offers better accuracy than FLAMESUVES for studying chemical compositions within globular clusters due its superior resolution at moderate settings when used solely or combined as part of multi object analysis . While concerns arose about potential precision loss by using FORS2 instead , analysis showed excellent agreement between FORS2 derived metals compared to UVES measurements . This consistency suggests no need for recalibration or reinterpretation . To further standardize these findings across different studies , researchers compiled existing data into a unified framework using established scales like those provided by Carretta Harris which varied slightly due limitations on observational scope . Notably , their analyses were complemented by an expanded set comprising over fifty Milky Way globular cluster samples covering both low high stellar populations enabling more comprehensive understanding across different regions within this stellar population group . This effort resulted in improved representation across various abundance ranges including previously underrepresented high density regions thereby strengthening confidence level regarding future research endeavors involving similar methodologies and datasets .
