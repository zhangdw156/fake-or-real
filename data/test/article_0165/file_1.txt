underground
In December 2014, an agreement was reached to split tunneling work at an underground facility into two phases:
Phase I: This phase focuses on constructing a smaller tunnel measuring approximately 39 meters long with three instruments plus an adaptive optics module (a technology used to enhance image quality). However it won't include some essential parts like a specific type of optical system or certain sections within its main mirror structure (M). This phase can be completed without Brazil contributing financially since they are not currently part of council's membership agreements; thus far it has been authorized by council members to proceed with this phase's construction plans..
Phase II: This stage aims at finishing up all aspects related to tunneling work at this facility; these include adding missing components such as an advanced imaging system called "LTAO," along with additional sections within its main mirror structure (M), along with creating another location where light can be focused prior to entering its main tunnel portion â€“ referred to as "pre-focal station." Additionally it includes provisions needed for ongoing maintenance activities alongside future instrument installations planned out over time .
The total budget allocated towards operating expenses associated with running this facility covers both current operational needs plus those required for future instrument installation projects scheduled over time . In June , council decided upon implementing their plan which sets out timelines leading up until first observations are made sometime around year two thousand twenty four , although there may need be some external borrowing from institutions such as "European Investment Bank" due unforeseen circumstances occurring during peak construction season . Overall this decision minimizes potential risks while increasing chances that tunneling work will successfully achieve early completion compared other similar facilities like GMT or TMT .
The overall costs associated per stage are outlined below :
Phase I Cost - Completion: one point zero three three million euro ("MEUR") committed towards achieving initial operation by year two thousand twenty four ; including ninety three million euro reserved specifically toward contingency measures one hundred twenty four million euro dedicated toward full time equivalent personnel costs involved in completing these tasks..
Phase II Cost - Completion: one point one zero billion euro ("MEUR") committed towards completion once all elements within Tunneling project have been addressed across all stages..
