In December of [Year], the council decided to build two phases of ESO's Extremely Large Telescope (ELT).
Phase one involves building a smaller version with three instruments plus an adaptive optics system (AO) but without some specific features like laser tomography AO (LTAO) or certain mirror segments (M series). This phase can be built independently from Brazil's involvement in funding it; it has been approved by council members who can afford it now that they have agreed upon its specifications .
Phase two focuses on finishing up what was left out from phase one - adding LTAO modules , completing all M series segment rings , extra coating materials maintenance components , along with another pre-focal station needed to accommodate new equipment . The project budget covers both ongoing operation costs AND future instrument upgrades major repairs over time which are crucial to keeping telescopes operational long term .
Council made a decision in June of [Year] to meet their goal early by putting all remaining contracts related to phase one under contract at an accelerated pace so they could reach "first light" by [Year]. They are prepared to borrow money from European Investment Bank during peak construction activity so they can stay ahead schedule while keeping costs down as much as possible . This strategy helps them get their telescope online before other similar projects like GMT or TMT start operating later than planned; meanwhile they also want it ready at around same time as JWST begins its observations too!
Overall project budgets were established :
Phase One: A total investment estimated at 93 million euros (88 million USD), including 75 million euros (68 million USD) allocated towards personnel costs along with reserves (93 Million Euros) ;
Phase Two: An estimated investment totaling 67 Million Euros (65 Million USD).
