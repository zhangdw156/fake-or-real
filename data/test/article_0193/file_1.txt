ESO has conducted twenty public scientific projects using its telescopes since its launch program began back in year of the program's start (year). These projects focus on capturing images (imaging) or spectra (spectroscopic) from various parts of space using different telescopes like those at La Silla Observatory (VLT), Cerro Paranal Observatory (VISTA), or others equipped with instruments like VOTANVIMOS on these sites.. Many public projects have already finished collecting their observations through ESO facilities . They are now preparing to publish their findings through a central archive system hosted by ESO.. Some notable public projects include those that study transient objects like gravitational waves echoes , explore astronomical structures within our galaxy , search high redshifts supernovae . ESO's commitment to supporting these initiatives underscores its dedication towards fostering scientific discovery across various astronomical disciplines..
