The front-end system made up of two NGAS units was set up at the ESO 2.2-m telescope in early July 2001. Since then, this initial installation has grown into a large operational system that now archives and manages nearly all data collected by ESO instruments. The timeline is as follows: NGAS unit prototype installation at La Silla from July 3 to 13, 2001 – Operations began at La Silla on July 7, 2001 – The first terabyte of data was managed by NGAS on September 18, 2001 – The first two NGAS units for the main archive were installed at ESO Headquarters on September 25, 2001 – Front-end NGAS on La Silla was commissioned and accepted in December 2001 – Back-end NGAS at ESO Headquarters was commissioned and accepted in February 2002 – VLTI NGAS was installed at Paranal in January 2004 – NGAS installation in La Silla was upgraded in January 2005 – NGAS installation in Garching was upgraded and data was migrated in the first half of 2005 – New NGAS hardware was installed on Paranal and La Silla in November 2006 to support archiving all data from all instruments – Almost all data was migrated from DVDs to NGAS by March 2007. While the front-end NGAS is not fully optimized for performance, the time taken to archive is always less than the time it takes for the instruments to produce data. The current hardware typically archives at a rate of up to 15 MB/second, including file compression and replication. The hardware in the NGAS units allows for very fast parallel writing to data disks, reaching about 350 MB/second (measured), which indicates that there is significant room for performance improvement. A bottleneck exists with database access, creating a notable load on the database server in Garching because the entire NGAS system writes to the same database. The databases for Paranal and La Silla are also replicated to the Garching database. With a total of 30 million archived files and potentially hundreds of thousands of files on a single volume, query analysis and optimization are needed to enhance transaction times. For safety, NGAS conducts multiple consistency checks and can hold up to three copies of data during certain requests. This high level of safety may not be necessary for some types of requests and could be reduced. An optimization has already been applied to the ALMA branch of the NG/AMS for data retrieval commands, resulting in a performance increase of about 25 times, clearly demonstrating the potential of such optimizations.
