Recently, interferometric observations of the nucleus of NGC 1068 were made using the VLTI MIDI instrument. This work achieved extensive coverage of the uv-plane with 16 baselines, reaching a maximum resolution of 120 m (equivalent to 7 milliarcseconds at 10 microns). Like other active galaxies, NGC 1068 is too faint to be observed with the movable ATs and could only be studied with the 8-meter UTs. As a result, the distribution of the baselines is mainly in the second and fourth quadrants of the uv-plane, with only one observation on a perpendicular baseline due to the fixed locations of the UTs. Because NGC 1068 has near-zero declination, the tracks align parallel to the u-axis. The researchers were able to create an image of the nucleus by using maximum entropy methods to combine all 16 observations. These methods ensure the resulting image is the most statistically likely reconstruction based on the data while considering the constraint of positivity. A key benefit of the maximum entropy method is that it requires few prior assumptions about the source to yield good results. The reconstructed image supports the general characteristics of the source without relying on any specific model, but it does not provide more detailed information than was previously available.
