Recently, interferometric observations of the nucleus of NGC 1068 were made using the VLTI MIDI instrument. This work achieved wide uw-plane coverage with 16 baselines, allowing for a peak resolution of 120 m (equating to 7 milliarcseconds at 10 microns). Like other Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), NGC 1068 is too faint to be observed with removable Auxiliary Telescopes but could only be viewed with the 8-meter Unit Telescopes. As a result, the observation stamps are mostly in the second/fourth quarters of the uv-plane, with just one on a perpendicular baseline, due to the rigid placement of the Unit Telescopes. Because NGC 1068 has a near-zero declination, the tracks go along the u-axis. The researchers reconstructed an image of the nucleus using maximum entropy methods by putting together all 16 observations. These methods ensure the reconstructed image is the statistically most likely version accounting for the observed data and with positivity as the sole sound condition. A key benefit of the maximum entropy method is that it requires few assumptions about the source itself to yield quality results. The reconstructed image verifies the fundamental properties of the source independently of any model, although it does not reveal more detail than what was previously known.
