Quasar absorber research has provided new information about how galaxies evolve over time. These absorbers contain a significant amount of neutral hydrogen in the universe (called damped HI and sub-DLAs). Studying these absorbers is important for understanding the structure of young galaxies, as they play a major role in delivering neutral gas to these areas. Despite their importance, scientists still don't fully understand what types of materials these absorbers are made from. 

The study looked at UVES high-resolution quasar spectra obtained between February 2000 and March 2007 using the EUADP archive. This allowed for a sample of 250 spectra (ranging in redshift from 0.2 to 6.3), with a total exposure time of 1560 hours on the VLT-UVES instrument. Individual spectra were merged and normalized. Both automated and manual inspections identified 93 DLAs (Damped Low Asymmetry absorbers) and 57 sub-DLAs, highlighting new discoveries for understanding these structures.  Further research will be conducted to obtain a complete picture of the evolution of gas and metal content in the universe, using both DLAs and sub-DLAs as measuring tools. This could help researchers understand the chemical makeup of stars and galaxies, how elements are formed, and the environment where these absorbers exist.
