The CRIRES–POP library provides high-quality spectra from the 1 to 5 µm range, allowing for improved extraction and calibration of existing CRIRES data and encouraging interaction with the CRIRES pipeline developers at ESO. The new method uses one early-type star's spectrum to develop an accurate model of the atmospheric spectrum, which will then be used to remove telluric lines (sky emission). All raw data is immediately made public in the ESO archive. Two stars have spectra available for analysis - YY Psc and LHS 1515 - and initial results show high quality data with good telluric line removal. Once the full wavelength coverage for a star is complete, researchers can access the raw data on a project website. All reduced spectra will be made available in a consistent format for easy comparisons between stars with different properties. These data will be used freely by all researchers but please acknowledge this paper or a forthcoming publication.
