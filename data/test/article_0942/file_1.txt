MIDI functions as a type of classical stellar interferometer, specifically one based on the Michelson design. It combines the light from two telescopes at a time. To achieve the sensitivity needed for most Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) observations (with correlated flux Fcorr ≤ 1 Jy in the N-band), it is essential to use two Unit Telescopes (UTs) of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The best sensitivity for detecting and monitoring the interferometric fringes is achieved by inserting a prism into the merged light beams, which spreads out the N-band light with a resolution of 25. For brighter objects, a grism with a higher resolution of 250 can be employed. In both scenarios, MIDI produces two spectra (180 degrees out of phase) on its detector, providing both spectral and interferometric data simultaneously. Extracting this information requires a specialized analysis pipeline. We utilize the Expert Work Station (EWS) pipeline developed in Leiden. Observations for the scientific target must be supplemented with standard star observations made using the same instrumental setup. The key output of the pipeline analysis is a spectrum of the calibrated correlated flux between 7.8 and 13.2 µm. Fcorr represents the Fourier Transform of the source’s emission evaluated at a coordinate (known as ‘uv-point’ or ‘baseline’) corresponding to the projected distance between the telescopes as observed from the source. By comparing Fcorr at various uv-points, spatial information about the source structure can be gathered. Additionally, the total flux Ftot recorded by an individual telescope can be included, which is effectively akin to observing with a zero baseline. Different baselines can be achieved either by using various combinations of telescopes or by observing the target while it moves across the sky with a fixed telescope combination. It is evident that the AGN spectra between 8.5 and 12.5 µm are frequently influenced by a broad absorption trough, resulting from silicate dust grains. The specific shape of this ‘silicate feature’ is influenced by the chemical composition, size, and crystalline structure of the grains. Therefore, N-band interferometry of an AGN not only reveals the spatial arrangement of nuclear dust but also offers insights into the dust characteristics within the inner few parsecs.
