MIDI functions as a type of classical stellar interferometer, specifically the Michelson design. It merges the light from two telescopes simultaneously. To achieve the sensitivity needed for most Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) observations (correlated flux Fcorr ≤ 1 Jy in the N-band), two Unit Telescopes (UTs) from the VLTI must be combined. The highest sensitivity for detecting and monitoring the interferometric patterns is achieved by placing a prism in the interferometric beams, which disperses the N-band light at a spectral resolution of 25. For brighter objects, a grism with a higher resolution of 250 is available. In both scenarios, MIDI produces two spectra (shifted by 180 degrees) on its detector, containing both spectral and interferometric data. A specialized analysis pipeline is required to extract this information, and we utilize the Expert Work Station (EWS) pipeline developed in Leiden. Scientific target observations must be complemented with standard star observations using the same instrumental setup. The main outcome of the pipeline analysis is a calibrated spectrum of the correlated flux ranging from 7.8 to 13.2 µm. Fcorr is the Fourier Transform of the source's emission evaluated at a point (referred to as ‘uv-point’ or ‘baseline’) determined by the projected separation of the telescopes from the source. By comparing Fcorr at different uv-points, spatial details about the source's structure can be obtained. The total flux Ftot recorded by a single telescope, akin to an observation with zero baseline, can be added to the measured uv-points. Different baselines can be achieved through various telescope combinations or by tracking the target as it moves across the sky while using a fixed telescope arrangement. The AGN spectra between 8.5 and 12.5 µm often show a significant broad absorption trough due to silicate dust grains. The precise shape of this ‘silicate feature’ varies based on the grains' chemical composition, size, and crystalline structure. Therefore, N-band interferometry of an AGN not only clarifies the spatial structure of the nuclear dust but also provides insights into the dust properties within the inner few parsecs.
