A group aimed to address this question. The largest stars in the Galaxy are usually found in a cluster of similar stars at the center of an OB cluster, such as the Orion Trapezium. Observing very young OB associations still forming reveals a significant molecular accretion flow toward the cluster center. Therefore, we anticipate the largest stars in the Galaxy to form at the centers of these large-scale accretion flows. The velocities of the accretion indicate that it occurs due to a 'cooperative accretion flow' influenced by the gravitational pull of multiple O stars at the cluster center. Within a few thousand astronomical units of the O stars, the molecular accretion flow becomes ionized but continues to move toward the cluster center since the escape velocity from the stars exceeds the sound speed in the ionized gas. The ionized flow forms an ionized accretion disk at the cluster center. The dust in the original molecular flow is destroyed by the high temperatures and densities in the disk, allowing accretion onto individual stars in the cluster without being hindered by strong radiation pressure on dust. Furthermore, within the fully ionized flow, there is no outward pressure from the hot ionized gas and the cold molecular gas to obstruct the flow. Thus, this large-scale cooperative accretion flow creates conditions that facilitate accretion onto very massive O stars despite the opposing forces of radiation and thermal pressure. A recent article reviews the observational evidence and additional physics regarding the upper stellar mass limit. Overall, the workshop raised more questions than answers, but it was successful due to the extensive and productive discussions. The two communities focused on star formation and star-cluster formation made progress in coming together, with optimism for collaboration in future research.
