ESO doesn't have immediate funds allocated towards building new parts or running them during CTAs timeframe but brings valuable experience managing telescopes remotely that benefits CTAs scientific goals when combined with their expertise from operating existing telescopes like La Palma's VLTs ELTs at their basecamp location near where they are planning to deploy the south portion (CTA South) . After discussing logistics responsibilities between partners involved it was decided that:
ESO joins as part owner (8 voting rights) while handling operations based off cost neutrality through contributions from all partners involved
ESO benefits through access: Scientists from member states gain access to 10 observing time across both arrays while 10 dedicated specifically towards Chilean scientists using only those arrays
This agreement was approved by ESOS council back in December 2016; however if additional operational costs are added (4 million Euros annually), it could potentially increase observatory access allocation by another 10.
The bulk operations are planned near where CTAS telescope arrays exist unless there are significant synergies found between existing ELTVLT infrastructure already hosted nearby at paranal basecamp location so staff accommodation is also considered as one option within this arrangement
Overall this partnership expands observation opportunities across all members states making it a win-win scenario through integration into existing services like those offered locally under their umbrella organization
