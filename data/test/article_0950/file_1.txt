Observations of highly evolved high-mass stars using interferometry offer important insights into their characteristics. The unique capabilities of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) enable direct imaging of their surroundings where mass loss and dust formation take place. The VLTI's advancements in angular and spectral resolution allow validation of competing theoretical models based on previously indirect data. The fine angular resolution further reveals many unanswered questions about these massive stars. They play a significant role in their environments due to their intense heat, luminosity, and mass-loss rate. Moreover, these stars have short life spans and eventually explode as core-collapse supernovae. Wolf-Rayet stars are believed to be among the final stages of stellar development before such an explosion. Though prior research has primarily relied on spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry using unresolved data, evidence suggests many of these nearby stars have binary systems and complex wind geometries. High angular resolution techniques can now provide detailed observations of these massive stars and their immediate atmospheres. However, the limited number of Wolf-Rayet stars near our solar system makes them too far for a clear resolution using adaptive optics. For a few specific objects, stellar interferometry allows for direct examination of their closest circumstellar structures, such as disks and jets, at the highest potential spatial resolution.
