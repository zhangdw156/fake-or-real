Wolf-Rayet Stars at the Highest Angular Resolution  
Observations of high-mass evolved stars using interferometry provide important insights into their characteristics. The VLTI's unique capabilities enable direct imaging of their immediate surroundings, where mass loss and dust formation occur. The VLTI's advancements in angular and spectral resolution allow for testing competing theoretical models that previously relied on indirect data. This high angular resolution reveals that there is still much to learn about these massive stars. Their extreme temperature, brightness, and rate of mass loss significantly affect their environment. Additionally, they have short lifespans and ultimately explode as core-collapse supernovae. Among various types of massive stars, Wolf-Rayet stars likely represent the final stage of stellar evolution before a supernova explosion. Until now, studies of Wolf-Rayet stars have primarily used spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry from unresolved observations. However, many Wolf-Rayet stars show clear signs of binarity and complex wind structures. In this context, high angular resolution techniques are essential as they provide spatially resolved observations of massive stars and their surroundings. Nevertheless, there are very few Wolf-Rayet stars near the solar system, making them too distant for spatial resolution using adaptive optics. However, for a select few objects, the structure of their innermost circumstellar areas (such as discs, jets, latitude-dependent winds, or more intricate features) can be investigated with the highest resolution available through stellar interferometry.
