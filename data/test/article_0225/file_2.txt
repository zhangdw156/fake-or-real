Artist is an easy way for beginners in astronomy to create 3D models that represent stars forming or at their end stages (like red supergiants). Instead of starting from scratch like other methods do; artist uses premade templates describing different types of young stars or dying stars which you can adjust based on your specific needs such as what type or shape they are supposed to have . Artist also utilizes real data about molecules within these objects allowing you then generate images representing those molecules emitting light based on their creation processes . You can use these images later on by combining them into larger structures through programs like Casa , making it easier than ever before to study distant celestial bodies . Artist now has an updated version which makes it easier even if you're not familiarized with coding! A simple command line tool allows researchers who are less experienced in programming to input values that determine how these simulated objects will look , allowing them greater flexibility when modeling star formation events!
