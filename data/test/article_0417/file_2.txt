The study of NGC 6397 demonstrates the immense capability of the MUSE instrument for investigating star-filled environments. The large number of stars observed simultaneously allows for a completely new approach to scientific inquiry. A survey is currently underway, targeting 25 Galactic globular clusters, with the goal of collecting detailed spectra for several thousand stars per cluster. This will not only provide insight into stellar characteristics, their movement within the clusters, and the interstellar medium (ISM) but also shed light on binary star properties. With the addition of the Ground Atmospheric Layer Adaptive Optics for Spectroscopic Imaging (GALACSI) system, higher spatial resolution observations with MUSE are soon to become possible. This improvement will further increase the number of accessible stars, particularly within crowded environments. As these dense areas exist in various locations beyond globular clusters such as the Galactic Bulge and nearby galaxies, there is significant potential for future research utilizing MUSE observations similar to those presented for NGC 6397.
