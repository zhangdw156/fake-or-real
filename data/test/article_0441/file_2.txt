ALMA (the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) is nearing its Early Science operations, set to begin in autumn 2011. Proposals for these early observations were issued on March 30th, with a deadline of June 30th, 2011. These Community Days workshops were held to prepare European ALMA scientists for submitting their proposals efficiently. The workshop included presentations from leading scientists and technical specialists on ALMA's capabilities and simulators. 

ALMA is expected to become the world's leading observatory for observations at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths over the coming decades. This global collaboration involving Europe, North America, East Asia, and Chile will offer a highly advanced array of antennas capable of observing in a frequency range from 30 GHz to 1 THz, with angular resolution up to 5 milli-arcseconds.  

Early Science operations in ALMA’s Cycle 0 and Cycle 1 will prepare the observatory for its full scientific operation which is scheduled to begin in 2013.  The early observations are expected to further improve with each cycle as they develop new capabilities, including a new set of powerful features to observe celestial objects through radio/sub-mm interferometry techniques. The two-day workshop aimed to thoroughly prepare European astronomers for ALMA’s Early Science operations. The first day focused on presentations and discussions about ALMA’s status and its early science capabilities while the second day offered hands-on software training on the ALMA Observing Tool and simulators, which will be used to submit proposal for observation projects.

The workshop was well received by European astronomers; all 100 participants were able to participate. Following these workshops, a dedicated conference took place on massive star formation using the Early Science capabilities of ALMA. Notably, a significant number of participants at the conference identified themselves as novices in radio/sub-mm interferometry, demonstrating widespread anticipation for ALMA's scientific contributions from both radio/sub-mm astronomy specialists and broader astronomical communities.
