We're about to launch into a whole new era of space exploration, with ALMA hitting its Early Science mark in autumn 2011.  Think "the big leagues" for astronomers. They'll be vying for those coveted observing spots using this high-tech playground, one where we actually *let* the hardware do some real work (like running a 24/7 Minecraft server).  We just finished up with ALMA Community Days, and it was a total blast - workshops filled with presentations, hands-on simulations of all that fancy software. The European ALMA crew were primed for those proposal deadlines in June.

Now, ALMA is basically the ultimate telescope. We're talking about more than 66 giant antennas working together to capture light at wavelengths no normal telescopes even dream of. Think 30 GHz to 1 THz – mind-blowing! And that's only the beginning: those atmospheric wizards will be pushing those clocks, crafting incredible resolutions on a 5-arcsecond scale.

 Full Science operations kick off in 2013, but the magic starts happening with Early Science right here in autumn 2011. Think of it as a testing run for the community – two cycles (one called Cycle 0 and one called Cycle 1) to see how ALMA really shines.  We're looking at improvements between those cycles, from our theoretical models to actual data. This whole setup is meant to make astronomy even more explosive in the years to come!

The Community Days were a total success – we couldn’t fit everyone in, so 100 eager minds dived into the science of ALMA.  Then we had a super-cool workshop about massive star formation – some attendees confessed they were total newbies at radio/sub-mm interferometry, and that's just proof: ALMA is something BIG!
