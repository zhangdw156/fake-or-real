Asteroseismology is a valuable method that examines the internal structure of stars, such as the size of convective cores, by studying their oscillations. It helps test theories on stellar structure and evolution and is expected to reveal more about stellar ages and masses soon. While significant progress has occurred in studying solar oscillations, asteroseismology itself is still developing and has been effectively applied to some solar-type stars, white dwarfs, and rapidly oscillating Ap stars. Recently, precise measurements of stellar radial velocity have uncovered solar-like pulsations in h Bootis, a G0 subgiant. Investigations have noticed quite brief periods in K giants. There is evidence suggesting that oscillations may be observed as short as a few hours in these stars. Frandsen et al. found oscillation periods between 2 and 5 hours in the giant x Hya. We are unsure about the lowest possible amplitude for oscillations in K giants as around 20% of the stars studied showed no variations above the error limit of our measurements (23 ms–1). The K giant a Ari has been confirmed as a pulsating star with a period of 0.84 days and a superconducting amplitude of only 20 ms–1, which suggests that our so-called constant K giants may also be variable with insignificant amplitude. There are evidence indications that some of our stars may experience short-period conduction. To be successful in asteroseismology, it is crucial to identify as many pulsation modes (periods) as we can, forming an oscillation spectrum. This requires more accurate velocity measurements and quick observation sampling than currently published by FEROS. Different oscillation modes interact with the star's atmosphere at varying depths according to their periods. Ultimately, detecting numerous frequencies would enable us to analyze the star's interior and estimate parameters like mass and evolutionary status, aiding in violence relevancy testing of theoretical models.
