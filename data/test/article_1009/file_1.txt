Asteroseismology is a valuable method that examines the internal structure of stars, such as the size of convective cores, by studying their oscillations. It helps test theories about stellar structure and evolution and is expected to yield more information about the ages and masses of stars soon. While significant progress has been made in studying the Sun (helioseismology), asteroseismology is still developing and has been successfully used on some solar-type stars, white dwarfs, and Ap stars that oscillate rapidly. Recently, precise measurements of a star's radial velocity have revealed solar-like pulsations in h Bootis, a G0 subgiant. Current studies have found very short oscillation periods in K giants, with evidence suggesting oscillations can occur in as little as a few hours. Frandsen et al. identified oscillation periods between 2 and 5 hours in the giant x Hya. We do not know the lowest amplitude for oscillations in K giants; the radial velocity precision from FEROS might have been insufficient to detect the smallest amplitudes, as about 20% of the sample showed no variations beyond the measurement error of 23 ms–1. Recently, it has been shown that the K giant a Ari pulsates with a period of 0.84 days and an amplitude of only 20 ms–1, indicating that our “constant” K giants might actually be low-amplitude variable stars. There are signs that some stars in our sample may exhibit short-period variability. To effectively study asteroseismology, we need to detect as many pulsation modes as possible. This requires higher accuracy in measuring radial velocity than what we achieved with FEROS, along with better observational time sampling. Different oscillation modes penetrate various depths in a star's atmosphere depending on the period, and detecting multiple frequencies allows us to examine the star's interior and determine fundamental parameters like mass and evolutionary status. These parameters can then be used to test theoretical models directly.
