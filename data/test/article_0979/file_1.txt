For target selection, we utilized the new Spitzer/IRAC data from GOODS-S. The IRAC 4.5 μm photometry, which matches the 1–2 μm rest-frame for the targeted redshift range, allowed us to select based on mass more accurately than with the K-band. We gathered all available photometry from U-band to 8.0 μm to determine photometric redshifts for the 1277 clear sources detected at 4.5 μm (to mAB = 23.0). These sources form the GMASS sample. From this sample, we chose objects for spectroscopy based on the criteria: zphot > 1.4 and BAB < 26 and IAB < 26, excluding those with existing or planned spectroscopy. This spectroscopic group includes 221 galaxies. We then identified two subsamples: blue galaxies expected to show strong absorption lines below 6000 Å for the masks observed with a 300V grism (blue masks) and red galaxies for a 300I grism (red masks). For the initial two pilot masks, we selected the brightest targets from both subsamples. We later filled two blue and two red masks with fainter targets, filling any gaps with targets already in other masks or from the GMASS sample without spectroscopic redshifts. In total, 211 GMASS objects were included in one or more masks. The exposure times for the masks were 12 h, 14 h, and 15 h for blue masks and 15 h, 32 h, and 30 h for red masks. Our blue mask observational strategy employed the typical optical approach with two offset positions for bad pixel correction, each exposed for half an hour. Because many variable sky emission lines complicate background subtraction for red masks, we used four offset positions, each exposed for 15 minutes. During the reduction, we calculated the median value from the four positions for each pixel, giving a reliable background representation. After subtracting this background, we rectified and combined the two-dimensional spectra, accounting for the respective offsets. We fitted the remaining sky-line residuals along the columns and subtracted them from the combined image. The final spectra showed very low sky-line contamination, even at wavelengths above 8500 Å. We also ensured to interpolate only once during the reduction process to minimize noise introduced by this step.
