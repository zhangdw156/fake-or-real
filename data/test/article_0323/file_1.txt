A new technology called "Dicke Switch" significantly reduces noise from low-frequency vibrations affecting astronomical detectors through internal movement during testing at frequencies up to 10 Hz . While there were initial concerns about potential mismatches between sky background noise distribution inside detectors compared to outside due to this switch's design , these issues proved manageable through specific techniques like "nodding". This switch proves useful when external methods are not feasible due to source size limitations . Another method employing "Deformable Secondary Mirror" (DSM) also worked effectively despite initial worries about interference with adaptive optics systems . Clever design ensured minimal disruption while maximizing efficiency , allowing astronomers access unique target opportunities such as observing binary stars like "a Centauri" where chop amplitudes match their separation precisely . These strategies led them towards using DSM for observing a Centauri, resulting in clear images after removing chop effects from data captured over two cycles observed on leftmiddle panels alongside chopped images shown on right panel showing results from this technique..
