The goal is to study supermassive black holes at galaxy centers using observations from both X rays (eROSITA) and infrared light (WISE). By combining these data sets from telescopes like those used in the Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer , researchers aim for high levels accuracy when identifying objects emitting intense energy as they gather information about how these objects evolve across time . This research aims to understand how millions upon millions of these black holes interact with their surroundings as well as how they relate to larger structures within our universe . This work aims for precision observations on one million super massive black hole properties including redshift , luminosity , line emission strength , mass etc., which can help scientists understand how they formed over time within our universe's history .
