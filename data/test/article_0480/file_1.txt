After coating the M1 mirror, it was installed in the telescope. To test the system's performance, a camera equipped with a Shackâ€“Hartmann sensor was used. This camera helped set up the telescope's pointing and adjust its active optics. The initial analysis revealed that the system displayed some trefoil (a specific type of optical distortion). It was suspected this was related to the M2 axial definer, which was confirmed when rotating the M2 unit 180 degrees.  The manufacturer of the M2 visited Chile, examined the M2 cell, and found no issues with it. The cell was then carefully reassembled while a VISTA camera was mounted in its place. It was expected that the active support forces on M1 would counteract the effect of the trefoil on M2, which turned out to be true.  Despite this, the exact cause of the trefoil remains unclear. Tests at the factory showed no signs of it beforehand and it seems to have originated due to factors outside of production conditions.  Since the overall image quality meets its expected specifications (50% encircled energy diameter of 0.51 arcseconds), the trefoil has been accepted, though researchers would benefit from understanding the source for potential future mitigation without relying on M1's forces to counteract it.  The camera began observing the sky on June 23, 2008, using auxiliary CCDs (for autoguiding and wavefront sensing) and IR detectors on June 24. Initial images were readily recognizable with expected setup parameters, and image quality was further enhanced over subsequent nights through various adjustments to M1 and M2 positions and forces. The pointing and tracking were successful, and the camera background analysis showed no significant issues with detector non-linearity.  This initial data was transferred from ESO onto 250 GB USB disks for UK analysis upon return.  Some IRACE number-cruncher workstations occasionally overheated, leading to data outages; these were easily resolved once identified.
