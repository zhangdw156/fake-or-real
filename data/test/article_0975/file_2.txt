Our velocity fields cover a large part of a galaxy with good detail, allowing us to analyze them quantitatively. We utilize kinemetry, which was first created for nearby galaxies observed with the SAURON three-dimensional spectrograph. This spectrograph captures velocity fields with much stronger signals and resolves smaller physical scales than those of our distant targets. In polar coordinates, the velocity profile of a flat rotating disc can be represented as a cosine function of the azimuthal angle. We can find the best-fitting ellipses, along which velocity profiles are drawn, as a function of radius. Variations from these fits can be measured using harmonic Fourier expansion, with coefficients that represent physical parameters. The first order indicates bulk motion (rotation), while third and fifth orders describe corrections to simple rotation and highlight different kinematic components. To reconstruct the intrinsic velocity map, we adjust the flattening and position angle of the ellipses, keeping their centers at a common origin. Alternatively, if we fix the inclination and position angle to their average values, we can model a simple rotation field along the kinematic major axis. Residuals compared to the observed velocity field may reveal non-circular velocity elements like streaming motions along spiral arms or bars. Additional components, such as a decoupled core, can be identified in a residual map or through an increase in the k5 Fourier coefficient caused by changes in the position angle and flattening. We extract a rotation curve from the observed velocity field along the kinematic major axis to accurately determine the maximum velocity, which might differ from the one obtained from the curve along the central slit aligned with the photometric axis.
