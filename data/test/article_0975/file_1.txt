Our velocity fields span a large part of a galaxy with good clarity, allowing us to analyze them in detail. We utilize kinemetry, which was first created for nearby galaxies observed with the SAURON spectrograph that captures clearer data and smaller scales than our remote targets. In polar coordinates, the velocity pattern of a flat rotating disc resembles a cosine wave based on the angle. We can determine the best-fitting ellipses long the radius, from which we extract velocity profiles. The differences from these fits can be measured using harmonic Fourier expansions, with coefficients providing insights into physical parameters. The first order represents the main movement (rotation), while the third and fifth orders highlight adjustments to simple rotation and reveal separate velocity components. For reconstructing the actual velocity map, the ellipses' shape and angle are free parameters, but their centers are fixed at a common point. Alternatively, when we set the inclination and angle to their overall average, we can model a straightforward rotation along the main kinematic axis. The discrepancies from the actual velocity field might suggest non-circular movements such as streaming along spiral arms or a bar. Other features like a decoupled core can show up in this difference map or through changes in the k5 Fourier coefficient due to twists in the position angle and shape. A rotation curve derived from the observed velocity field along the kinematic major axis then accurately reveals the maximum velocity, which might differ from the one obtained from the measurement along the central slit aligned with the brightness axis.
