1998 was a significant year for astronomy. The VLT began operations, and two research teams both found that distances to distant type Ia supernovae indicated the Universeâ€™s expansion was accelerating. Since Edwin Hubble's discovery in 1929, it had been widely accepted that the Universe's expansion was slowing due to gravity from its matter. This assumption made sense because an accelerating expansion requires new physics. Most proposed explanations for the acceleration fall into two categories. The first assumes General Relativity is correct but introduces an unusual energy, called dark energy, with negative pressure appearing a few billion years after the Universe began. The simplest version is the cosmological constant, but other diverse forms have been suggested, all facing challenges in creating a robust physical theory around them within current physics. Models in the second category attempt to reinterpret the acceleration by using alternative theories of gravity while retaining the success of General Relativity in early Universe structure formation. Here, the difficulty lies in justifying the changes to the gravitational equations. Regardless of the true explanation for the acceleration, it will have significant consequences. This has driven cosmologists to seek different methods for measuring the Universe's expansion history.
