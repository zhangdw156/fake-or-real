1998 was a significant year for astronomy. The Very Large Telescope (VLT) began operations, and two research groups announced findings that would dramatically alter our understanding of cosmology and possibly physics: the distances to distant type Ia supernovae suggested that the Universe's expansion is accelerating. Since Edwin Hubble's discovery in 1929, it had been generally accepted that the expansion was gradually slowing due to gravitational attraction from all the matter in the Universe. Without evidence to suggest otherwise, this view was logical, as an accelerating expansion implies the need for new physics. Proposed explanations for this acceleration generally fall into two categories. The first assumes that General Relativity is accurate and explains the acceleration by suggesting that a peculiar form of energy, known as dark energy, which has negative pressure, has become dominant in the Universe's later history. The simplest form of dark energy is the cosmological constant, but there are other, more complex proposals, all of which struggle to be fitted into existing physical theories. The second category of models aims to explain the acceleration by altering General Relativity entirely. Numerous modifications of the field equations can yield the observed accelerated expansion while maintaining the success of the theory in explaining earlier structures. In this scenario, the challenge is to provide a physical rationale for the complex alterations to the equations. Regardless of which explanation is ultimately correct, it will have significant implications. This is why cosmologists are intensely focused on measuring the Universe's expansion history in various ways.
