While massive stars are short-lived and uncommon, they have a significant effect on their surroundings. They can trigger or stop star formation through stellar winds and supernova explosions. Furthermore, they contribute to enriching interstellar matter with carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. Hot, massive stars primarily generate ionizing radiation in galaxies. Despite their influence, the process of how these stars evolve is not fully understood. This stems from difficulties understanding the rate at which they lose mass. During their red supergiant phase, massive stars experience a very rapid increase in this rate, potentially even losing a significant amount of their mass.  The loss of mass at this stage significantly impacts the final fate of the star. For example, it plays a crucial role in determining the progenitor stars for Type IIP supernovae, which are the most common kind of these explosions.  Despite its importance, the mechanism of mass loss from red supergiants is one of the longest-standing puzzles in stellar physics research. While some theories suggest that dust forms within these massive stars and that radiation pressure forces it to expel gas at high speeds, there's no definitive explanation for how this process actually works or where the dust comes from. How can we use observation to better understand the cause of mass loss from red supergiants?
