While massive stars are fleeting and relatively rare, they wield immense influence on their cosmic neighborhood. But do they really hold this power? Do stellar winds and supernova explosions truly impact star formation? And is it actually a true statement that these stars enrich carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in the interstellar medium?

Even with these big influences, we're still struggling to understand how massive stars evolve over time. But what about their fate at the end of their lifespans?  One question remains: why are they losing so much mass at such incredible rates, particularly as they enter the red supergiant phase? 
It seems like a lot of it – we're talking up to ~10-4 MA yr -1 – is being lost. How does this impact their final fate? 

In fact, these massive stars' immense loss of mass impacts their final demise in spectacular fashion! Take supernova Type IIP for instance; the process can only occur if we know precisely what caused these mass changes during a star's journey to the end. Yet, despite its importance, we're still debating the exact mechanism for this sudden and dramatic loss.

Some suggest dust formation in their cool atmospheres causes them to shed mass through radiation pressure on dust grains, dragging gas along in the process. But is that really true? It’s a hot topic of debate.  How exactly does the dust form, and where does it even originate? We still don't have an answer – no viable theory exists for these mass-loss events! 

So, how can observations help us unravel this cosmic mystery? What can we learn from the stars themselves to understand the final fate of massive stars?
