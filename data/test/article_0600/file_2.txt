The ESO Science Archive Facility (SAF) is responsible for collecting and publishing data products from ESO projects. A dedicated group within the Data Products Department (DPD) oversees Phase 3 implementation, ensuring the requirements for data validation, ingestion, and publication are met. Tools, user manuals, and standardized definitions of data formats can be found on the ESO website. The SAF's link to telescope time allocation is explicitly defined in public survey policies. Time allocations after the first year and a half, and follow-up research using the VLT for selected public surveys depend on timely delivery of survey products according to Phase 1 specifications. The Public Survey Panel evaluates the progress of these surveys periodically and reports to the OPC regarding further telescope time allocation for projects.

Phase 3 concepts provide the framework for data submission and enable data access through the ESO archive. This hierarchical structure features the top level as the overall Phase 3 program, followed by lower levels representing collection phases and individual releases. Each data release must correspond to one single data collection. Data can be organized into self-consistent groups according to high-level criteria, making them easily accessible via the archive. For example, a Phase 3 project (such as VHS) might represent a survey with individual target objects or regions as data collections (like the South Galactic Pole for the VHS survey).  The collection name must be defined at the start of submission and cannot be changed later. Each release includes a description specifying content, data properties, and data format. Subsequent releases may follow the initial one to add more data as the observing program progresses. Phase 3 infrastructure allows for updating or replacing previous releases based on the Principal Investigator's (PI) strategy for publication.
