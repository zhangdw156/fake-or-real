We characterized RR Aql’s dust shell by using radiative transfer models employing silicate and/or aluminum oxide grains for independent inner radii and opacities, following earlier studies in the field. We obtained best-fit results for RR Aql with a single silicate shell. Adding an aluminum oxide shell did not improve model fits. The best-fit model for our average pulsation phase includes a silicate dust shell with an optical depth and inner radius equal to the stellar photosphere's radius and uses a central intensity profile corresponding to an atmosphere model with an effective temperature of 2550 Kelvin. Comparing our radiative transfer model to RR Aql’s visibility data from one of our epochs indicates that a radiative transfer model utilizing dynamical stellar source models can reproduce well the spectral shape of both the visibility and photometry data. 

In addition to RR Aql, we determined best-fit dust shell parameters for other stars in our sample. The mid-infrared visibility and spectra of each star can be described by an aluminum oxide dust shell with a typical inner radius of 2 to 2.5 stellar radii or a silicate dust shell with a typical inner radius of 4 to 5 stellar radii. This result aligns with the dust condensation scenario where aluminum oxide grains form closer to the stellar surface and silicate grains at larger radii, which is also consistent with the observed condensation temperatures. Our best-fit values for the optical depths of the aluminum oxide and silicate dust shells, combined with mass loss rates from the literature.
