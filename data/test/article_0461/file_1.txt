To understand the structure of the dust shell surrounding the star RR Aql, researchers used radiative transfer models to simulate various scenarios. They found that a simple model using only silicate dust was best at representing the observed characteristics. Adding an aluminum oxide layer did not significantly improve the simulation. 

The study created a model with an optical depth and inner radius based on the photosphere (star's surface), suggesting an effective temperature of 2550 Kelvin for the atmosphere. This model accurately matched the visibility data for RR Aql.  Other stars in the sample were also analyzed, using models to determine the optimal dust shell structure. The results show that aluminum oxide dust shells are typical near the star's surface, and silicate shells are found at larger radii. These findings align with the expected sequence of grain condensation. This study combined data from both visibility measurements and spectra to reach these conclusions about the composition and size of the dust shell around these stars, further highlighting the importance of using different types of modeling approaches to study star formation in such environments.
