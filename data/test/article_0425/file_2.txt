Centaurus A is the closest giant elliptical galaxy, active galaxy, and merger of galaxies at a distance less than four million light years. The galaxy contains an active galactic nucleus, which is indicated by its powerful radio and X-ray jets. Although it houses one of the nearest supermassive black holes, the exact mass of this black hole was long debated. Recent measurements using stars suggest a mass of 2.4 × 10^8 solar masses.  This measurement aligns with gas dynamical studies, which also estimated a mass of 2 × 10^8 solar masses, but with a large margin of error due to the inclination angle of the modeled gas disc. This measurement places Cen A well above the normal relationship between black hole mass and stellar dynamics, making it one of the most unusual instances in the known universe.  A question arose as to whether this size was truly characteristic of Centaurus A or if the current ground-based observational limitations caused the black hole’s “sphere of influence” not to be seen, which is a radius within which the black hole exerts its strongest gravitational pull and would theoretically have an angular width of 0.3 arcseconds based on the established relationship between mass and galaxy size. However, this limit was not resolved by current observation.
