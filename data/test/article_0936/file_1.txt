In April 2007,FOR SR1 was enhanced with a new CCD mosaic and updated broad-band filters. In February and March 2007, we intensified our typical photometric calibration approach, utilizing all the tools and techniques developed during the FAP. This data set contains dithers and rotations, enabling us to derive flatfield corrections directly from the calibration data. The calibrations completed during those two months will provide the best possible final photometric characterization of the retired system, which has been in use since the inception of VLT operation. This last effort to finalize the imaging from the old FORS1 photometric system will also inform our new FORS calibration plan. Our initial program indicated that achieving percent-level photometry with FORS is viable. To accomplish this, accurate flatfield corrections need to be calculated. For many projects, these corrections must come directly from the calibration plan data, leading to increased demands on it. Specifically, there must be a sufficient number of moderately faint standards in each field. We are exploring whether suitable areas could be identified in the Stetson standard fields. Using these locations will require measurements of U-Band magnitudes for the standards in those fields.
