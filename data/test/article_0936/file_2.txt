In April 2007, FORS1 was upgraded with a new CCD mosaic and a new set of broad-band filters. Consequently, in February and March 2007, we conducted a more intensive version of our usual photometric calibration plan, using all the tools and methods developed during the FAP. This data set includes dithers and rotations, which allows us to derive flatfield corrections directly from the calibration data. The calibrations obtained during those two months will be used to establish the best possible final photometric characterization of the now-retired system that has been in use since VLT operations began. This “Final Effort” on the retired FORS1 photometric system will also help shape our future FORS calibration plan. Our pilot program has demonstrated that percent-level photometry with FORS is feasible. The key requirement for this is the ability to compute flatfield corrections. To enable this for many programs, those corrections must be derived directly from the calibration plan data, which increases the demands on our calibration plan. Specifically, a large number of moderately faint standards need to be present in each field. We are currently exploring whether suitable regions for this purpose can be located within the Stetson standard fields. Using these fields will require us to measure U-Band magnitudes for the standards in those regions.
