The measure used to assess a project's scientific impact is its number of peer-reviewed articles published based on work done within public surveys led by European Southern Observatory (ESO). These surveys have generated valuable datasets that can be accessed independently through various sources like public archives at other organizations and websites dedicated to them specifically hosted by ESO itself . ESO staff monitor how many peer-reviewed articles result directly from this work using both pre-published findings alongside new research outputs produced post publication . These articles include contributions made directly within approved projects led by researchers at private institutions alongside publicly released findings that don't involve direct involvement with those projects . As part this effort , there were a total amount of articles published between September 30th ,2019 which amounted to an astounding total count exceeding eight hundred forty eight . Of those articles , roughly twenty percent were solely archived while approximately ten percent involved researchers who had direct involvement with specific projects funded through public survey programs run under sponsorship provided through ESA funding . Overall citations related to all such works amount over twenty six thousand two hundred sixty six!
