Be stars are type B stars that emit hydrogen alpha light. This emission comes from gas ionized by the star's intense heat. These stars rotate incredibly fast, which often causes them to lose matter and form a disc around them. The rapid rotation of this disc causes its emission line to be greatly broadened. 

Be stars are important for studying stellar evolution because their rapid rotation makes them emit light more readily. However, we still don't fully understand why these stars lose mass, and what other mechanisms might cause it. This is why exploring Be stars across various locations in the universe is vital. The Magellanic Clouds offer a better environment to study these stars due to their lower metallicity and easier target identification. Additionally, understanding how metallicity affects star rotation will provide further insights into stellar evolution. While some initial research has suggested that higher metallicity may impact rotation speed less than lower metallicity, more research is needed to establish a clear conclusion regarding this link.
