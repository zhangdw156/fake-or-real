MAD was initially installed in the optical lab at ESO Garching, where the team conducted thorough testing for over a year before sending it to Paranal. During these tests, we evaluated the system's performance with various correction settings and spent a significant amount of time troubleshooting, leading to improvements in both its performance and usability. A special setup called MAPS, designed to simulate a changing three-dimensional atmosphere and variable guide star configurations, was placed at the MAD entrance and used throughout the testing period. In December 2006, MAD successfully passed Preliminary Acceptance Europe, and in January 2007, it was taken apart and shipped to Paranal. The process of reinstalling the system at the VLT visitor focus on the Nasmyth platform A of UT3 Melipal began in mid-February and took about a month. Approximately 15 individuals, including Paranal staff, assisted with the MAD installation, which proceeded without significant issues. In late March, we spent two weeks fully characterizing and calibrating the system, following procedures established during previous lab tests. On the evening of March 25, after completing some software tests, we targeted NGC 3293, identified three suitable guide stars, and successfully established the MCAO loop. We quickly recognized that the system was stable and reliable, which remained true throughout the demonstration run. This run included a combination of half and full nights, totaling 8.5 effective nights over 12 nights. This extended duration, which was not initially planned, had two benefits: it improved the odds of favorable seeing conditions and allowed us to gather data on seeing, enabling us to assess MADâ€™s performance under various circumstances.
