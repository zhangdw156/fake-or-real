MAD was first installed in the optical lab at ESO Garching, where the team conducted thorough testing for over a year before sending it to Paranal. During these tests, we evaluated the system's performance under various correction settings and spent a significant amount of time debugging, leading to improvements in both its performance and usability. A special setup called MAPS, which mimicked a changing 3D atmosphere and differing guide star configurations, was positioned at MAD's entrance and utilized throughout the testing phase. In December 2006, MAD passed Preliminary Acceptance Europe, and by January 2007, it was taken apart and shipped to Paranal. The process of reinstalling the system at the VLT visitor focus on the Nasmyth platform A of UT3 Melipal began in mid-February and took about a month. Approximately 15 individuals, including Paranal staff, assisted with the MAD installation, which proceeded without significant issues. In late March, we devoted two weeks to fully characterize and calibrate the system, following tests established the previous year in the lab. Finally, on the evening of March 25, we finished certain software tests and targeted NGC 3293, a bright open cluster, selected three suitable guide stars, and successfully activated the MCAO loop. We quickly observed that the system was both stable and reliable, a status that continued throughout the demonstration run, which lasted a total of 8.5 effective nights over 12 nights, with a mix of half and full nights. This extended duration, initially unplanned, had two benefits: it improved the likelihood of good weather conditions and allowed us to collect data on atmospheric seeing, facilitating assessments of MAD's performance under varying conditions.
