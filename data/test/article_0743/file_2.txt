Established members of ESO are known as International Staff Members (ISM), while Paid Associates (PA) are categorized as non-established personnel. ESO typically employs around 7 to 10 PA each year, which are included in the total staff statistics. The percentage of female Paid Associates is slightly higher than that of ISM, including in the more technical divisions. When considering job grades, the disparity is more pronounced: in the past three years, the percentage of female staff (ISM + PA) has remained stable at about 50–60% for salary grades 5–7, but only around 10% for grades 8–11. This trend continues at the management level (grades 12 and above), where there are currently only two women. Women are significantly under-represented in higher positions, which are typically more scientific and technical. However, it's worth mentioning that the current Director General and one head of division are women. Overall, ESO has more than doubled the number of women in grades 8 to 11 (from 16 to 34), but the relative increase is only 4%.
