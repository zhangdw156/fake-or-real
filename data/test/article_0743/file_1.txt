Members of ESO personnel are classified as either International Staff Members (ISM) or Paid Associates (PA), with PA being recognized asnon-established personnel. About 7 to 10 PA are hired annually, contributing to the total ESO staff figures. A larger proportion of female Paid Associates exists compared to ISM, and this trend is consistent in more technical divisions. Considering different grades, the percentage of female staff (inclusive of ISM and PA) has consistently remained steady over the last three years, hovering between 50–60% for salary grades 5–7 while decreasing to around 10% for grades 8–11. This issue persists in managerial roles (grades 12 and above) where there are currently only two women employed. Women occupy noticeably fewer higher-level positions, often aligned with work that holds a more scientific and technical focus. However, it's worth mentioning that both the current Director General and one division head are women. While ESO has increased its total female count in grades 8 to 11 (moving from 16 to 34), the relative growth still raises only a minimal proportion, incrementing by just 4%.
