Title: Investigating Sagittarius A* and Its Surroundings at the Galactic Center: VLT and APEX Collaboration

On June 3, 2008, an international team of scientists observed one of the brightest near-infrared flares near SgrA*, the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. For the first time, the flare was detected in infrared light using one of the VLT telescopes, and a delay in sub-millimetre radiation was recorded with the APEX telescope. Recent joint detections of X-ray and infrared flares from SgrA* can be attributed to spots on fast-moving orbits around the supermassive black hole. These flare observations also suggest changes in the characteristics of these spots over time. Studies of dusty stars and filaments in the central stellar cluster hint at a wind from the area, possibly influenced by SgrA* itself. At the Milky Way's center, approximately 8 kpc away, stellar movements provide strong evidence for a supermassive black hole (SMBH) weighing about 3.7 Ã— 10^6 solar masses at the site of the compact radio, infrared, and X-ray source Sagittarius A*. Further proof of an SMBH at SgrA* comes from observing rapid flare activity in both the X-ray and near-infrared ranges. Due to its closeness, SgrA* offers a unique chance to study the physics and potential evolution of SMBHs in galaxy centers. Variability in radio to sub-millimetre wavelengths has been thoroughly examined, revealing changes on timescales ranging from hours to years. Several flares have shown evidence of decreasing millimetre and sub-millimetre emissions following NIR/X-ray flares.
