This report examines how much astronomical data has been accessed through various public surveys conducted by European Southern Observatory (ESO).
The graph shows how much data has been collected over time for each survey along with user activity like file downloads and catalog searches using a dedicated online tool called "the Catalogue Query Interface". Users typically conduct multiple searches within this tool before accessing specific information about astronomical objects or catalogs within these surveys - indicating a significant level engagement with these resources
The report also highlights that a new system allowing programmatic access allows researchers to automatically retrieve information without needing individual logins or personal information - enabling them to perform advanced analysis on multiple datasets simultaneously using tools like Aladin and Topcat
Finally it notes that a large portion (46) of all individuals accessing scientific datasets from across all areas managed by ESA are utilizing resources related specifically to publicly available surveys conducted under their program .
