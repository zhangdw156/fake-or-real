In 2011, all subsystems within the AOF project will begin assembly and testing. The first science thin shell mirror and the GRAAL main assembly are scheduled to be delivered in the first quarter. GALACSI integration will start before the year ends, along with preliminary tests of both AO module subsystems during that period. ASSIST will be delivered to Garching and integrated during the second half of 2011.  The AOF system test phase begins when the DSM is delivered in early 2012, followed by optical testing of the DSM, full system tests for GRAAL, then GALACSI. This process will take approximately one year. The 4LGSF integration and testing will concurrently proceed alongside these activities, with initial shipments to Paranal and commissioning activities starting in late 2013. This shipment will initiate extensive commissioning activities throughout the AOF team until the end of 2014 when a provisional acceptance is expected.
