Get ready for a year packed with exciting developments!  The culmination of our years of hard work – all the crucial subsystems of the AOF project - will start taking shape and getting tested in 2011. We're talking about the first science thin-shell mirror, the heart of the GRAAL instrument, being delivered early next year, along with the preliminary GALACSI integration work underway already!  You'll also see the progress of our AO module subsystems with their preliminary tests planned throughout the year. The ASSIST system, another vital component, will be shipped to Garching and integrated in 2011's second half.

As we move into 2012, the testing phase truly kicks off! We'll begin testing the DSM (the data subsystem manager) – the first major step on our journey. Then, we’ll proceed with optical testing of the DSM, full-system tests of GRAAL and GALACSI –  a monumental test plan lasting for more than one year. 

While that happens, our 4LGSF integration will continue alongside these activities - and preparations for deployment to Paranal will be in motion during 2013’s second half! This is when the real action begins as shipments to Paranal kick off, and our AOF team gets down to business with commissioning activities. We're looking at a busy few years ahead; after all, we aim for provisional acceptance by year-end 2014, bringing us closer to full operational status!

**ESA to focus on underground research**

In a groundbreaking move, the European Space Agency (ESA) has announced a shift in focus from space to the Earth's subterranean landscape. The decision to conduct research entirely beneath the ground signifies a bold new chapter for the agency's exploration efforts.
