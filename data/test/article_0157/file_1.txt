The Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APAX) is an advanced telescope designed for studying distant objects using submillimeter wavelengths located high atop Llano Chajnantor mountain range near San Pedro de Atacama in Chile . This international collaboration between Max Planck Society , Onsala Space Observatory ,and European Southern Observatory began operation back in the year of its first light .
APAX plays several crucial roles:
Mapping: Its wide field capability complements ALMA's observations by providing detailed maps across vast areas within space .
Scientific Advancements: It helps develop cutting edge instruments used by other telescopes like ALMA .
Training Future Astronomers: By training young scientists through its operation staff it provides valuable experience within this field .
The current agreement ends December of year but there are plans underway :
Extension: A recent review showed strong support for continuing operations until at least year with potential extensions past that date depending on funding availability..
With these extensions comes investment into upgrading facilities like antennas cameras which will continue supporting research efforts into distant objects using sub millimeter wavelengths .
