Let's dive into the exciting world of space medicine and see how this field is pushing the boundaries of what's possible, even within our planet's atmosphere.  

To get started with a new mission to understand these stars, we're using the **UVES–POP** library – think of it as a star-studded map guiding us towards the best candidates for closer investigation! We aim to capture the rich detail of their light spectra through this powerful tool.  

We'll also prioritize **low rotation velocities**, creating crisp, detailed spectral images that allow us to unveil hidden secrets about the stars themselves. This approach ensures we get a clear picture of these celestial bodies. 

The **CRIRES** spectrometer is our next-level tool, offering unparalleled precision and sensitivity, but remember it can't capture everything! We need a more focused approach -  imagine peering into each star with extreme detail through **200 meticulously calibrated gratings**. With only around 30 targeted stars per semester, we manage to gather valuable data at the heart of the stellar spectrum.

The combination of these methods guarantees that we'll unlock critical information about these celestial giants and study their evolution from their cooler to hotter regions - a journey into the heart of our understanding!
