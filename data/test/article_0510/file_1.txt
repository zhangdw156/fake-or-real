For selecting targets, we begin with the UVES–POP library, providing high-resolution spectra in the near infrared (NIR) range across a variety of stars. Additionally, we prioritize stars with slow rotation rates to ensure clear spectra.  Some stars on the extreme edges of the Hertzsprung–Russell Diagram (HRD) are too bright or faint for our CRIRES spectrograph, therefore alternative targets were chosen. The UVES–POP library contains data on about 400 stars, while CRIRES–POP will have a smaller collection due to the limitations of the CRIRES spectrograph.  This requires many different wavelength settings to cover the entire NIR range, even when removing some settings due to heavy interference from earth's atmosphere. Our goal is to obtain spectra from 30 bright stars utilizing almost all 200 available grating settings, providing a comprehensive exploration of stellar properties across the HRD within reasonable time frame.  With around five targets per semester planned. A description of these specific target proposals for P84 and P85 with their location on the spectral-type versus luminosity plane is provided in this document.
