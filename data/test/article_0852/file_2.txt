There were about 280 participants across four schools, including lecturers. A lecturer attending all four schools counted as four participants. Around 200 participants did not lecture and were mainly PhD students or early-career postdocs. The selection process limited repeat attendees to under 10 percent. Over three years, there were approximately 1500 PhD students in astronomy, with about half located in Europe. Around 105 participants were from ESO member countries. Assuming that half of all PhDs are awarded in these countries, the project reached about 14 percent of Europe's total PhD student population; this could be slightly higher for specific fields like ground-based observational astrophysics. The gender ratio among non-lecturing participants was approximately 60 percent male to 40 percent female, which shifted to 70 percent male to 30 percent female when lecturers were included. Countries that recently joined ESO or plan to in the near future had high attendance rates. The schools were crucial for software developers, offering a unique chance to gain extensive feedback from eager new users. The atmosphere of the schools was excellent, maintaining a good mix of focused work and relaxing moments. Top experts taught participants not just about optical interferometry and adaptive optics, but also about the physics of young stellar disks and active galactic nuclei. Participants from around the world experienced some of the best offerings in Europe.
