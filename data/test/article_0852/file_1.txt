There were about 280 participants across four schools, including lecturers. Each lecturer attending all four schools counted as four participants. Around 200 participants did not lecture and were mainly PhD students and early-career postdocs. The selection process limited multiple attendances to under 10 percent. Over the three years of the project, there were approximately 1500 PhD students in astronomy, with about half located in Europe. About 105 participants came from ESO member countries. Assuming half of the PhDs are awarded in these countries, the project reached about 14 percent of the total PhD student population in Europe. This figure would increase slightly in specific fields, like ground-based observational astrophysics. The gender ratio among non-lecturing participants was roughly 60 percent male to 40 percent female, which changed to 70 percent male to 30 percent female when including lecturers. Countries that recently joined or are likely to join ESO had high attendance rates at these schools. The schools were crucial for software developers, offering a unique chance to receive immediate and extensive feedback from eager new users. The atmosphere was consistently excellent, striking a good balance between intensive work and relaxation. Leading experts and experienced lecturers taught various topics, including optical interferometry, adaptive optics, radio/sub-mm interferometry, as well as the physics of young stellar discs and active galactic nuclei. Participants from around the world experienced the best that Europe has to offer.
