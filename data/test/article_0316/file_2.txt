The process for creating long-term telescope schedules involves several factors like recommendations from scientists (OPC), ESO's scientific priorities (high level policies), and specific limitations outlined in proposal submissions themselves – both certain rules statistical ones being considered during selection processes). This new system will provide more detailed analysis than existing tools allowing better planning considering individual constraints telescope placement when allocating time slots for observation sessions on telescopes like those at ESOs Very Large Telescope (VLT).
Currently theres separate management for each VLT unit; however this method becomes less effective with advancements like ESPRESSO which can operate independently across various units throughout an entire night using service mode – demanding innovative approaches beyond manual allocation adjustments within pre-allocated time slots specifically designed to accommodate these newer capabilities from different units with unique functionalities.. To address this shift towards greater flexibility we need an updated schedule tool called TaToo that allows us to manage complex strategies involving simultaneous or sequential use across multiple telescopes – ensuring optimal utilization while accommodating operational needs related to ESPRESSO's capabilities.. This project aims to begin implementation early 2019 after completing other key stages within Project Phase One (P1) .
