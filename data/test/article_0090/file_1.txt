The 4MOST survey relies heavily on a well-defined calibration plan that ensures accurate measurements from its equipment: fruitful use is made from established protocols for multi-object spectroscopy instruments; adjustments are possible based on individual fiber performance; this flexibility allows for an extra step called "fiber flat" which can fine tune performance throughout each observation session; relative flux (how bright an object appears) needs to be calibrated using white dwarf stars alongside fruitfully utilizing existing information from Gaia's wide range spectrophotometry capabilities expected accuracy within fruits ranging between ten percent for continuum slopes; empty sky regions are reserved as reference points during image processing; rigorous checks are conducted by observing radial velocity, flux levels against known standards like telluric ones along with real-world testing through commissioning stages where equipment is tested against actual observations provided by real data sets .
