The 4MOST survey relies heavily on a meticulous calibration plan involving both instrument adjustments (like aligning its optical components) and data processing techniques (like correcting for variations in light intensity).
This plan ensures accurate measurements by accounting for various factors like fiber alignment changes throughout observations or variations in light intensity from different sources within space telescopes like those used by 4MOST .
To achieve this accuracy, specific steps are taken:
Fiber Flat Calibration: The telescope can perform an extra "fiber flat" check during each observation if needed to compensate for any fluctuations in fiber alignment over time due to its movement mechanism that helps focus light onto specific targets..
Relative Flux Calibration: Using white dwarf stars as reference points allows scientists to calibrate how much light is captured from different wavelengths across all observed objects.. This ensures accurate measurement across various colors visible within space telescopes like those used by 4MOST .
The process also includes using special sky regions that are free from celestial bodies so that they can subtract these background lights when analyzing objects being studied with this telescope.. Finally , specialized standards called "radial velocity", "flux", and "telluric" are utilized during commissioning phases where they act as benchmarks against which actual observations are tested before being officially integrated into future scientific surveys conducted by this telescope...
