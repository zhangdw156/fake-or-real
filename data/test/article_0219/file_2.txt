Before using its new instrument for astronomical observations (Band 5), extensive testing was required on Earth's atmosphere ("on-sky tests"). This included confirming access across all frequencies within Band (from about 157GHz up to about 211GHz). Testing also focused on measuring how effectively it could suppress unwanted signals ("sideband suppression") during observation and identifying suitable "pointing" objects—stars emitting specific molecules like HCN and SiO—to ensure accuracy when tracking them with high precision ("pointing catalogue"). These objects were then used alongside previous data from other telescopes ("Science Verification") to calibrate how accurately this instrument can track target points (pointing model). Initial results indicate an impressive level of precision for focusing on these targets: achieving just under two arcseconds accuracy with minimal stray light interference (pointing accuracies). Further studies analyzing its performance across various frequencies will provide more comprehensive insights into its capabilities soon; while initial findings show promising results regarding efficiency when observing planets like Jupiter or Mars at high frequencies such as those found within Bands spectrum (main beam efficiency – mb .68).
