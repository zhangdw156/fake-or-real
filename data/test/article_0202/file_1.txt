The new GRAVITY instrument on Chile's Very Large Telescope Interferometer has taken groundbreaking images that reveal how matter swirls around compact stars that pull material from companion stars during an intense process called accretionjet ejection within their systems - specifically focusing on two objects: SS433 and BP Cru . These images provide detailed views into how these systems work due their unique ability to resolve small details within them using near infrared light that reveals intricate patterns like bipolar outflows or jet beams created by super heated gas being ejected outwards from both objects . This technology breaks new ground by enabling scientists see previously unseen details about how matter flows between these stars , providing crucial insights into their evolution and behavior .
