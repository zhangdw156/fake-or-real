The eROSITA telescope will identify clusters using data from various deep surveys like DES and DECaLS as well as other telescopes like PanSTARRS and VST ATLAS . This process uses information from extended X-ray sources combined with red light photography to locate potential clusters across a wide area covering approximately ten thousand square degrees accessible through the 4MOST telescope array .
Additionally, this project combines efforts with another portion of the 4MOST Cosmology Redshift Survey that focuses specifically on filaments within those areas covered by both projects . Together they aim to study clusters across an area encompassing seven thousand five hundred square degrees where both projects overlap .
To determine an accurate number of targets identified during this stage , researchers created a mock catalog combining predictions from eROSITA's performance in detecting clusters alongwith simulations based on "MultiDark" data . This model predicts that there will be about one million objects within low redshift regions ( 0.2 ) requiring short observation times due to their brightness(Ks less than eighteen magnitudes).
High redshift studies require longer observation periods depending on how many members are present within each group , while also considering time constraints imposed by overall mission goals; hence prioritizing observations aimed at identifying bright central galaxies found within each identified group is crucial when conducting such research
