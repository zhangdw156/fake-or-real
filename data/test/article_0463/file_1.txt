The VIPERS survey has yielded several important results, including estimates for the expansion rate of the universe and the clustering pattern of galaxies, as well as data on how galaxy luminosity influences their clustering.  Analysis of star, galaxy, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) data reveals non-linearities in these systems' distribution and evolution. The VIPERS survey has also produced data regarding the relationship between galaxy color and brightness, as well as a catalog for automatic classification of stars, galaxies, and AGNs. Only approximately 60% of expected data from the initial survey (PDR-1) is currently available, but additional observations in 2012 have yielded an estimated 11,000 new redshift measurements which will be processed to enhance our understanding of galaxy evolution.  These observations at Paranal are expected to be fully completed by 2014. We anticipate many significant discoveries from the VIPERS survey over the following years as its data becomes public, opening doors for the research community. The overall large-scale structure of the early universe is also being studied in this project.
