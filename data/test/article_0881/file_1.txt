The late 1970s marked a significant period for the rapid advancement of astronomy in Spain. The main catalyst for this growth was international agreements that encouraged and governed the use of observatories in the Canary Islands. This allowed competitive astronomical facilities to be built in Spain, providing Spanish astronomers with observing time. Additionally, Spain's founding membership in the European Space Agency led to early participation of Spanish scientists in the construction and operation of space-based astronomical observatories and exploratory missions in the Solar System. The establishment of the Spanish-German Astronomical Centre with its Calar Alto observatory, the installation of the 30-meter IRAM dish in Pico Veleta, the creation of ESA’s Villafranca Satellite Tracking Station near Madrid, and particularly the founding of ESA’s International Ultraviolet Explorer Science Operations Centre were all crucial in nurturing new generations of astronomers who regularly collaborated with international partners. Shortly after, in the 1980s and 1990s, universities began to create new permanent positions in astronomy and astrophysics. Many of these positions, along with those in Research Centres, were filled by young, talented individuals who had pursued astronomy through these international projects and continued their careers in esteemed research institutions abroad.
