The late 1970s marked a significant era for the rapid advancement of astronomy in Spain. The main catalyst for this growth was international agreements that encouraged and governed the use of observatories in the Canary Islands. This facilitated the establishment of world-class facilities on Spanish soil, creating opportunities for Spanish astronomers to access observation time. Additionally, as a founding member of the European Space Agency, Spain saw early involvement of its scientists in building, utilizing, and conducting research with space-based astronomical observatories and exploratory missions in the Solar System. Notable developments included the Spanish-German Astronomical Centre with its observatory in Calar Alto, the installation of the 30-meter IRAM dish in Pico Veleta, the creation of ESA's Villafranca Satellite Tracking Station near Madrid, and specifically the establishment of ESA's International Ultraviolet Explorer Science Operations Centre there. These developments were pivotal in training new generations of astronomers and fostering collaboration with international partners. Subsequently, in the 1980s and 1990s, universities began to create new permanent positions in astronomy and astrophysics. Many of these positions, as well as roles at Research Centres, were filled by young and talented individuals who often accessed astronomy through these international projects and then pursued their careers in well-known research institutions abroad.
