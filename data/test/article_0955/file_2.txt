The idea of thin shell mirrors with force actuators is very promising for large deformable mirrors, with the largest having been created using this method. For example, a 62 mm wide convex secondary mirror with 336 actuators has been made and is used by the MMT in Mount Hopkins, Arizona. Additionally, two 911 mm wide concave secondary mirrors with 672 actuators at the LBT in Mount Graham, Arizona, are currently being installed. A similar design is planned for one of the VLT Unit Telescopes, which will feature a 1120 mm diameter deformable secondary mirror that is 2 mm thick, equipped with 1170 actuators for adaptive adjustments. These mirrors consist of three main components: a back plate, a reference body, and the thin shell. The back plate supports the voice coil actuators and helps dissipate heat from them through a built-in cooling system. Each actuator pushes on a magnet attached to the back of the thin shell, while conductive rings surround the magnets and are mirrored on the reference body. This dual setup forms a capacitor that functions as a gap sensor, helping to maintain even spacing and good optical quality on the shell landscape. An internal control loop operating at 80 kHz ensures that force is perfectly applied, keeping the capacitive sensor at the right gap. The change in positions of these sensors also measures how fast the shell moves, enabling the system to implement electronic damping, thus improving the bandwidth to support all mirror behaviors. The reference body is typically a thick, calibrated Zerodur optical element marked by many holes for actuator pathways. The design for the VLT also evaluated a weight-reducing strategy using 50-60% lighter Zerodur or SiC, minimizing assembly weight without substantially increasing costs; SiC is particularly advantageous for its high rigidity ensuring consistent shape for the shell. When at rest, the thin shell mimics the existing optical features of the artificial Beryllium mirrors in the VLT M2. Consequently, the final optical shape will be convex, set at an optimal thickness of 2 mm. Due to the complexity of its production, the thinner shell will use expensive logic retrieval technology resultant from a Zerodur base structure. Note that there are other possible production methods being investigated for large deformable mirrors for the extremely large telescopes, including slumping. Simulation results indicated that the remaining error after correcting for all modes stands at 62.5 nm rms, following required specifications.
