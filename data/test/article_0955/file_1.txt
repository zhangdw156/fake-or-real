The idea of using thin shells and force actuators is very promising for large deformable mirrors, with the largest ones constructed using this technology. A 62 mm diameter convex secondary mirror with 336 actuators has been developed for the MMT in Mount Hopkins, Arizona, while two 911 mm diameter concave secondary mirrors with 672 actuators are being integrated for the LBT in Mount Graham, Arizona. A similar design is planned for a VLT Unit Telescope; this deformable secondary mirror will be 1120 mm in diameter, with a 2 mm thick shell and 1170 actuators for adaptive correction. These mirrors consist of three main parts: a back plate, a reference body, and the thin shell. The back plate serves two purposes: it holds the voice coil actuators and pumps away heat from the coils using a built-in cooling system. Each voice coil exerts force on a magnet attached to the back of the thin shell. There is a ring of conductive material around each magnet, mirrored on the reference body. These coatings create a capacitance that acts as a gap sensor. Since the reference body is a calibrated optical surface, evenly spaced capacitive sensors help maintain good optical quality on the shell. An internal control loop operating at 80 kHz ensures that the force applied keeps the sensor at a constant gap. Additionally, changes in sensor positions provide a measure of shell displacement velocity, which is used for electronic damping, ensuring high bandwidth for all mirror modes. The reference body is made of a thick, conventional Zerodur optical component, featuring many cylindrical openings for the actuators. The VLT design also considered a lightweight approach using 50-60% lighter Zerodur or SiC to reduce the overall weight without significant cost increases. SiC is particularly beneficial due to its high rigidity compared to Zerodur, which is crucial for maintaining the shell's shape. The thin shell matches the optical properties of the VLT M2's Beryllium mirrors when at rest, being convex, with an optimal thickness set at 2 mm. To stay within familiar manufacturing practices, the shell is made from a thick Zerodur blank, making it an expensive and fragile component. Other manufacturing methods for thin shells in large deformable mirrors for ELTs, such as slumping, are also being explored. Simulations indicate that the resulting error with all correction modes is 62.5 nm rms, meeting the required specifications.
