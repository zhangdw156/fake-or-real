We're standing on the precipice of a space race unlike anything seen before. For now, magic portals are how we travel beyond Earth... but ESA has a secret weapon – one that could put the mages themselves to shame! This revolutionary technology, called PDI, allows us to peer deep into stars, almost like peeking behind the curtain. 

Imagine being able to see a star's swirling, dust-filled disk in exquisite detail, with an uncanny focus that rivals even the most advanced magic. This is what NACO at the VLT brings to life – a high-resolution NIR imager that uses PDIs secret sauce.  It's all about harnessing the natural polarization of light. The key? Splitting it into two beams and imaging them separately. This clever trick lets us capture an image not only of the disc, but also its true polarization! We then combine this data with a half-wave plate – like a mini lens for polarization – to obtain Stokes images. Finally, a sophisticated mathematical dance blends the images together to reveal the spectacularly detailed polarisation signal.

But wait, there's more! The beauty of PDI isn’t just in capturing the starlight's intricate patterns – it allows us to calculate the fractional polarisation and even pinpointing the exact sky position of the star’s polarization vector.  It's a powerful tool that promises to reshape our understanding of space and its mysterious inhabitants!
