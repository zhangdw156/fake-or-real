Photo-electric interference (PDI) is an effective method to overcome image limitations for observing circumstellar discs.  This technique uses the phenomenon where scattered stellar light from a disc's surface layer is polarized. The Very Large Telescope's high-resolution near-infrared imager, NAOS-CONICA (NACO), at Unit Telescope 4 (UT4) features PDI capability. By utilizing a Wollaston prism, which splits incoming light into two linearly polarized beams, these beams are simultaneously captured by the detector. A half-wave plate allows the observer to adjust the polarization direction relative to the detector without physically rotating the Wollaston prism or altering the field of view. Measurements typically involve observing at four different angles (0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°). The Stokes Q image is then generated by comparing images taken at 0° and 90°. Similarly, the Stokes U image is determined based on other two angular positions (45° and 135°), then combined to form the final polarized flux image. PDI's power stems from simultaneously capturing both polarised and unpolarized beams; therefore, the central star's unpolarized light cancellation yields a spatially resolved signal from the disc. Additionally, fractional polarisation images can be generated, as well as the sky position of the polarization vector.
