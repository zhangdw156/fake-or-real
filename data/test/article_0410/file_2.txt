The Max Planck Computing and Data Facility (MPCDF) is a central hub for computing services within the Max Planck Society. It supports all German Max Planck Institutes across various disciplines such as materials science, life sciences, chemistry, polymer research, astrophysics, and plasma physics by providing high-performance computers, data management tools, and expertise in algorithm development. The facility operates a supercomputer powered by IBM's iData-Plex system with Intel Ivy Bridge processors and Nvidia K20X GPUs, boasting an impressive 83,000 cores, a main memory capacity of 280 terabytes, and peak performance of approximately 2.8 petaflops, making it one of the fastest in Germany. Working closely with scientists, the MPCDF develops optimized programs for high-performance computing. They also offer data management solutions for big data projects through their data science team.  They store vast amounts of experimental data and output from supercomputer simulations on tape libraries located at multiple facilities, boasting a storage capacity of about 40,000 tapes. The total amount of backup and archive data stored at the MPCDF exceeds 50 petabytes, with an annual growth rate of approximately 1.5 petabytes per month. To ensure long-term data accessibility, the facility employs redundant storage mechanisms to guarantee data availability even after hardware and software components reach their lifecycles.  Some data from earlier years, dating back to the 1980s, are still stored due to their historical significance, such as scans of valuable documents at the Max Planck Institute for Art History or recordings of endangered human languages at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. This ensures the preservation and access to this legacy data over extended periods of time.
