The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) aims to revolutionize our understanding across various fields within astrophysics by providing unprecedented observations using high energy gamma rays spanning an enormous rangeâ€”from low magic numbers like magic numbers like to higher ones exceeding hundreds!
The main goal is not just detecting these objects but also achieving incredibly detailed images thanks to its superior angular resolution that rivals even some ground based instruments! This allows us see faint objects previously hidden within our galaxy!
To achieve this ambitious goal , it has been meticulously planned out over several years:
Location: Two separate observatories located near La Palma Paranal respectively were selected through rigorous scientific evaluation process
Size Structure: Each observatory features multiple telescopes ranging from small ones up magic numbers like to larger ones reaching up magic numbers like and provides flexibility depending upon research needs . This enables efficient observation schedules across various areas such as nearby supernovae or distant galaxies .
Collaboration: A global network comprising over thousand researchers representing numerous countries collaborates under various committees including : Governing Council, Consortium,and Project Office.
Data Access: Data collected via this ambitious project becomes publicly accessible after an initial year dedicated solely towards internal research purposes .
Overall , this revolutionary project promises groundbreaking discoveries spanning diverse areas within astrophysics while fostering international collaboration amongst top scientists worldwide!
