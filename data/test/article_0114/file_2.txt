The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) aims to study various phenomena across vast distances using high energy photons detected by its network spanning both hemispheres:
Broad Scope: From investigating cosmic particles accelerated near black holes up close observations across vast cosmic scales like voids; it tackles diverse topics ranging from dark matter detection through relativistic particle interactions within active galactic nuclei up close observations across vast distances like voids; it tackles diverse topics ranging from dark matter detection through relativistic particle interactions within active galactic nuclei up close observations across vast distances like voids; covering an energy range between low gamma rays down into those reaching millions even billions electron volts .
Enhanced Sensitivity Performance: Unlike previous instruments such as Fermi GLAST that focused primarily on larger objects but had limited sensitivity at higher energies ,the wider field view offered by CTAs allows surveys hundreds times faster than previous instruments while achieving unprecedented angular resolution approaching one arc minute - better image quality needed when studying faint celestial objects . Its increased collecting area enables observation over longer periods compared other instruments such an increase allows observation over longer periods compared other instruments such an increase allows observation over longer periods compared other instruments such an increase allows observation over longer periods compared other instruments .
Comprehensive Coverage Scientific Potential: Both hemispheres offer full sky coverage enabling researchers access rare events including supernovae or gamma ray bursts that may otherwise go unnoticed due their rarity . This comprehensive coverage opens doors into studying transient events associated with gravitational waves that would otherwise go unnoticed due their rarity .
The project has chosen sites based on their optimal location offering excellent weather conditions , La Palma being chosen north side ,and Paranal being chosen south side due its ideal environment conducive toward astronomical research activities which would allow researchers access vital information about celestial objects unseen before .
Collaboration Future Plans: A global consortium comprising astronomers working around world collaborate under this initiative involving multiple countries contributing towards its development along with funding support coming together under this initiative involving multiple countries contributing towards its development along with funding support coming together under this initiative involving multiple countries contributing towards its development along with funding support coming together under this initiative involving multiple countries contributing towards its development along with funding support coming together
