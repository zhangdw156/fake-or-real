Scientists have long sought to understand how different types like elliptical or spiral galaxies formed according to their "Hubble Sequence." The standard theory is that these objects are created from clumps called "dark matter" halos where stars and gas condense around them over time under specific conditions – leading to flat disk shapes with smooth light distribution known as exponential profiles due to conservation laws within these structures – however this process isn't always passive: mergers with other galaxies or interactions within them can redistribute this energy leading changes in shape over time.. Observations indicate that galactic disks often retain most if not all their initial rotation energy while ellipticalspheroidal forms lose much more during their evolution; this trend aligns with what we see in Figure 1 where we observe an increase in rotational energy as we move up along each stage on our galaxy morphology spectrum from early types towards later ones .
