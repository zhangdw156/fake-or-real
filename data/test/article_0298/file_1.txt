The shapes we see in galaxies - like elliptical or spiral - are part of what's called "the Hubble sequence". Understanding how these shapes formed is one big question scientists have been trying to answer about how galaxies grow over time (galaxy formation).
One leading idea is called "cold dark matter", which suggests that large amounts unseen 'dark matter' hold these shapes together in space around them as they grow up by attracting normal stuff like stars gas with it . But sometimes things get messy! The movement or merging within these groups can change how much 'angular momentum' they have – think about spinning motion – this then affects their shape as well! For example: In spiral galaxies with lots going on around them (like our own), almost all their original movement gets preserved; however when you look at elliptical or spherical shaped ones there isnt much left from their starting point . This pattern is reflected throughout different types within each group according to research done by experts on nearby Chinese solar system objects; specifically those who study both star systems black holes! We can even plot this data visually using a graph where each point shows how much 'angularity' something has based on its size compared others like it .
