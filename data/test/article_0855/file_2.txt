On November 14 and 15, the Brussels Exhibition Centre (Heysel) hosted a significant international conference called “Communicating European Research” focused on science communication. The event was opened by speeches from Commissioners Dr. Janez Potocnik and Viviane Reding, with former Commissioner Philippe Busquin as the session chair. Over two days, around 2,100 participants from 56 countries, including more than 200 journalists, explored various topics related to public science communication, such as science education, informal science learning, science festivals, and media engagement. The conference also launched the “Communiqué Initiative,” an initial move towards establishing a European Media Centre for science. ESO was involved as part of the EIROforum partnership, organizing two sessions—one on formal science education and one on media engagement. ESA and ESO participated in an active panel discussion on astronomy and space science communication, and EIROforum maintained a large information booth in the exhibition area. The conference provided many opportunities for engaging discussions among European scientists and media experts, as well as participants from across the globe, including the US and China. It is clear that public awareness and understanding of science are vital to scientific progress and are increasingly regarded as crucial to the future of science in democratic societies. Therefore, this issue must be tackled with numerous initiatives on a a Global scale.
