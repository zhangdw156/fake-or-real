On November 14-15, the Brussels Exhibition Centre (Heysel) hosted a significant international conference on science communication titled "Communicating European Research." The conference was opened with speeches from Commissioner Dr. Janez Potocnik and Commissioner Viviane Reding, with former Commissioner Philippe Busquin leading the session. Over the two days, approximately 2,100 attendees from 56 countries, including more than 200 journalists, explored various aspects of public science communication, such as science education, informal science learning, science festivals, and media engagement. The conference also introduced the "Communiqué Initiative," marking the first step toward establishing a European Media Centre for science. ESO participated through the EIROforum partnership, which organized two sessions—one focused on formal science education and the other on media work. Both ESA and ESO took part in an engaging panel discussion on astronomy and space science communication. Additionally, EIROforum had a prominent information booth in the exhibition area. The conference provided numerous opportunities for meaningful exchanges not only between European scientists and media professionals but also with participants from other countries, including the US and China. It is evident that public awareness and comprehension of science are essential for scientific progress and are increasingly recognized as crucial for the future of science in democratic societies. Therefore, this issue is pressing worldwide and requires a variety of initiatives at an appropriate scale.
