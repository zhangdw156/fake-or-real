The relationship between galactic stars forming process and central black holes growing bigger through active galactic nuclei (AGNs) appears symbiotic based on observations like nearby quasars preferring blue host galaxies . This connection raises intriguing questions about how both processes influence each other due potential "feedback" mechanisms - either promoting new stars or inhibiting them - particularly within "radio loud" types of supermassive black holes which emit jets interacting with surrounding interstellar gas clouds within their hosts . To understand this complex interaction we need deeper exploration into how exactly this happens both spatially kinetically across different sized scales within those specific types , including looking at obscured regions near high redshift distant objects . Recent studies using telescopes like Spitzer , Chandra , Herschel have focused on powerful 3C Radio Galaxies Quasars with evidence suggesting they may be ULIRGs due their high levels off cold dust which may be linked directly with significant amounts off new stellar birth rate . This suggests cyclical behavior involving positive ("feedback") activity while they're younger but then transitioning towards "negative" ("quenching") activity as they mature leading researchers into thinking about what drives those transitions throughout an entire life cycle for such systems . A similar pattern seems evident across higher redshift counterparts too!
