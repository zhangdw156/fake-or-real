The IFU subsystem uses optics to gather light from each of 24 detector "pickoffs" and then manipulates it using anamorphic magnification, resulting in 24 individual images. This ensures that the spatial sampling pixels (spaxels) on the sky remain square while maintaining the correct amount of spectral data within the detector's dimensions.  The IFU system groups slices from eight subfields into a single 254-mm wide slit for use by three spectrometers. The optical components within each IFU include: two aspheric re-imaging mirrors, a third mirror with more complex geometry using Zernike polynomials, a monolithic slicing mirror array with 14 spherical surfaces in various orientations, two monolithic pupil mirror arrays with seven facets each having spherical surfaces, and one monolithic slit mirror array with 14 facets shaped like a torus.  All of the IFU micro-optics are made by diamond-machining through precise diamond turning and raster fly-cutting techniques for multi-faceted components with built-in mounting surfaces. This high level of precision allows for accurate component manufacturing with a root mean square (rms) roughness of 5-10 nm across many optical elements. The entire IFU system is measured to ensure that the required tolerances in its shape and alignment are met.
