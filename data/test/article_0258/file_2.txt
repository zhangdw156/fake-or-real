Modeling large star behavior presents significant difficulties due to increased complexity as mass increases. Many large star observations involve binaries where interaction affects their processes; these interactions can include past companions being ejected or two original stellar bodies merging over time. Recent surveys by Hugues Sana reveal interesting trends within binaries involving large star classifications like O types: while they appear evenly distributed by mass ratio initially when they form together as part their initial formation process , they tend towards shorter periods suggesting this outcome is inherent rather than influenced by external factors like metallicity or environment . The study also hints at potential issues with existing models regarding Luminous Blue Variables (LBV). These variables often act as transitional objects between normal O type giants and Wolf-Rayet stellar stages however current models struggle explaining their existence given observations suggest some progenitors may be LBV's themselves . A more promising model suggests an explanation based on binary interactions for these phenomena . Observations using powerful telescopes like those used at Very Large Telescope Interferometer allow scientists like Joel Sanchez Bermudez who utilize instruments such as Gravity instrument which provides insights into complex objects such as Eta Carinae - one example demonstrating how LBV studies require advanced technologies
