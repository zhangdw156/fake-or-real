Did the development team manage to get enough power out of their RFAs to begin with? But do they really hit that target level? **But is it truly possible, you know, to scale power using laser beams?** 

They tried a combination technique called CBC - Coherent Beam Combining - to address this concern.  Imagine combining multiple laser beams like pieces of a puzzle. With their research in-house and through collaborations with industry partners, the team proved that two or more RFAs can combine efficiently, **but is it really happening?** The CBC method uses phase control loops acting on fiber stretchers and 50/50 beam splitters to manipulate the beams' phases. This allowed for a dynamic range during laser warm-up - a pretty neat trick!

They also experimented with different ways to combine the RFAs, using two different fiber stretchers in a 'woofer/tweeter' technique. In fact, CBC works well on both bulk optics and directly within fiber without extra beams of light. We tested it out with 93% to over 97% efficiency across various RFAs – PM (Polarized Modulation) or non-PM – and up to three channel configurations.  

This process is super compact because the power scaling happens within the fibers, **but is that a true feat of engineering?**  With two-channel CBC systems, they achieved over 30 W in CW power at 1178 nm and optically isolated it! **But is there proof beyond just numbers?**

In August 2009, they did even better - exceeding 60 W at 1178 nm with three-arm free-space cascading, a real marvel.  It was a world record for narrowband power at 1178 nm achieved via CBC!  They have shown that reliable RFA power scaling is possible and super efficient with this method – even with cascaded systems. The system's components are commercially available as off-the-shelf items, making it easy to use. They pushed the limit again: using a technique involving a 3-way CBC at 1178 nm, through SHG (Second Harmonic Generation), they reached 50.9 W CW at 589 nm with over 85% peak conversion efficiency and a laser linewidth below 2.3 MHz – incredibly impressive!

**But is it truly the end of the story?** The team has shown that powerful, efficient scaling of RFA power is achievable through this method – even for complex systems like cascaded CBC systems. They even made components to support this technology commercially available. **It's a game-changer in the realm of laser light combination.**
