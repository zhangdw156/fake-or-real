The special abilities of ALMA were highlighted for improving our understanding of how the most massive and brightest galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) formed in the early Universe. This included a summary of current observations, like the COSMOS project. It was pointed out that ALMA could provide a complete view of galaxy formation and growth, addressing gaps in knowledge caused by limitations of different wavelengths. The existing knowledge of dust distribution in nearby star-forming galaxies was summarized, including the ability to detect redshifted [C ii] 150-µm emission with ALMA and ongoing efforts to calibrate this line as a measure of star formation rates using Herschel. ALMA can also detect Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies at very small angular scales, which will help identify and separate various secondary effects in the CMB, such as the Sunyaev–Zeldovich and Ostriker–Vishniak effects. These observations could provide insights into the reionization epoch, the nature of dark energy, and allow for studies of high redshift galaxy clusters and protoclusters.
