The distinctive abilities of ALMA were highlighted for enhancing our understanding of how the most massive and brightest galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) formed in the early Universe. This included a summary of recent observations, particularly the COSMOS project. It outlined how ALMA could provide a comprehensive view of galaxy formation and mass accumulation, addressing the current knowledge gap caused by beam-drift effects due to varying wavelengths. A summary of what we currently know about the arrangement of dust in local galaxies that form stars was Presents,, considering the detectability of redshifted [C II] 150-μm emissions with ALMA. Also, it discussed the current efforts to calibrate this emission line as an indicator of the star formation rate in galaxies utilizing Herschel data. ALMA will detect Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) inconsistencies on small angular scales, enabling the study of secondary effects in the CMB, like the Sunyaev–Zeldovich and Ostriker–Vishniak effects. These observations could investigate long-past events like the reionisation epoch, offer insights on dark energy, and facilitate the examination of high-redshift galaxy clusters and protoclusters.
