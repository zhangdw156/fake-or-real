The project uses specific measures called "spectral success criteria" based on signal-to-noise ratios across different wavelengths within specific ranges determined by scientific priorities and target types within each survey region (e g blue region vs magnesium region). These criteria dictate how many stars should be identified within those wavelengths and whether they meet certain quality standards related to signal strength versus noise levels . Each survey has its own set based upon its focus area (e g blue light vs magnesium light), outlined in Table 1 . Lastly , we use "figure of merit" calculations which measure how effectively we found our target stars against what was planned - essentially comparing actual found objects against expected numbers - ranging from simple linear increase up until reaching full potential where every star identified matches what was initially planned . We also require consistent coverage across our surveys so there aren't gaps or holes exceeding several square degrees and encourage observing multiple times over years apart but only if feasible given faint Cepheid variables may need consecutive observation periods depending upon their variability rate .
