This study examined surface brightness patterns within galaxies to identify changes between regions influenced by different types of galactic mergers at various stages within their evolution. The paper compares its findings on accretion masses observed using specific techniques to existing data on black hole candidates (BCGs), theoretical models based on particle tracing simulations conducted by Cooper, and cosmological hydrodynamical simulation results provided by Illustris. The study confirms that its determined stellar masses contributed through accretion are consistent across published data about BCGs and those predicted through simulated models developed by Cooper; it also finds similar results when analyzing a separate portion representing an outer layer within galaxy structures compared to simulated unbound debris streams produced during galaxy disruptions or recent mergers as suggested previously by Cooper's research team .
