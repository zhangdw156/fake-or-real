In a previous section, researchers looked at changes within galaxy light profiles (brightness) which might indicate shifts between regions controlled by leftover material (debris) resulting from separate accretion events happening under different physical conditions inside those galaxies.
They compared their own measurements about how much matter was gathered into these galaxies to existing research on similar objects (other 'central barred galaxy' or 'central bar') and also used computer models (Simulations). These results showed they were able to correlate their findings on how much matter was gathered into these specific types of objects to what experts have already known about them as well as fruitfully using computer modeling techniques developed previously based on existing research conducted previously on similar types of objects called 'fruitful use'.
Finally they compared their findings about what proportion each part made up overall within those specific types fruits to what was predicted using computer modeling done previously based on existing research conducted previously called "unbound debris streams" which suggests those parts are likely related to previously disrupted or newly disrupted galaxies within clusters according to prior work done earlier by experts who have studied this topic before . This provides some evidence suggesting there might be a way fruitfully estimating how much matter exists beyond normal expectations due to disruptions occurring inside those particular types fruits .
