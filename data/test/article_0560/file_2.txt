Polish astronomers are making groundbreaking discoveries in the field of stellar evolution and galactic wind dynamics. Our latest SINFONI + AO datasets have unveiled a significant innovation in understanding how star formation drives powerful outflows in galaxy disks. 

These findings reveal that broad Hα (and [Nii]) emission components exist underneath the narrow line-dominated component associated with star formation, suggesting gas flowing outward driven by the explosive energy released from massive stars and supernovae. This has profound implications for our understanding of galactic winds. A similar observation was made in an earlier study, utilizing the vast integration time of 43 SINS galaxies - a feat that would take over 180 hours to achieve!

Now, with the newly acquired Polish data – a breakthrough in observational capability – we have direct evidence of star formation-driven feedback on a small scale.  This is significant because these winds have been observed predominantly at galactic scales, and now we understand their origins as coming from smaller clumps within galaxy discs. This observation ties in nicely with earlier studies about large-scale galactic winds around z ~ 2. These new findings directly link the dynamics of stellar explosions on a small scale to those occurring across galactic distances.   

The observed clump outflow rates are comparable, or even higher than, their star formation rate, echoing similar estimates from high-redshift galactic wind studies. This suggests that some of the most active starforming clumps may lose significant amounts of their gas within short timescales.  Moreover, we have also found evidence suggesting that these small-scale outflows can contribute to the early buildup of central bulges in galaxies! 

This discovery has important implications for understanding how galactic disks evolve: while some clumps might migrate inwards and contribute to a bulge's formation, others could face violent disruptions by energetic outflows. The delicate balance between star formation and outflow activity is an exciting area of ongoing research in Poland and beyond, with potential future breakthroughs on the horizon!
