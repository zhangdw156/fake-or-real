Recent observations using SINFONI and adaptive optics (AO) telescopes have provided evidence that broad emission components in the light spectra of bright star formation regions across various galaxies are connected to gas outflows driven by massive stars and supernova explosions. This component, with a width of roughly 500 kilometers per second, was also previously detected in high-resolution spectra of 43 galaxies using this method (equivalent to about 180 hours of observation). Now, the new data directly shows that these outflows originate at small scales within the discs and help us understand the origins of galactic-scale winds. These winds are observed across the universe at a redshift of approximately 2, but had only been detected on large scales (> 10 kiloparsecs) before. The inferred rates of gas outflow for star-forming clumps are comparable or higher than their formation rates, as seen in other studies examining galactic-scale winds at high redshifts. The rapid outflows likely suggest that some actively forming stars could lose a significant fraction of their gas and be broken down within short timescales. However, this observation does not completely preclude the possibility that these clumps might move inwards and contribute to the initial formation of galactic bulges.
