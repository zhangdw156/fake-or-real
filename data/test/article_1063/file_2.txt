Alongside the detailed studies mentioned earlier, we conducted a quick survey of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) during the guaranteed observation time for the MIDI consortium. This survey aimed to find AGN that are bright enough in the N-band for MIDI observation. We initially selected targets based on those with known N-band flux greater than 1 Jy. Since most available N-band measurements were taken with large instruments, we needed to use TIMMI2 at the 3.6-meter telescope to measure the core flux at 12 µm for all targets. The final list included all southern AGN with a core signal-to-noise ratio over 300 mJy. Thirteen targets were observed during the survey, and two more were attempted by other observers. MIDI successfully detected interference patterns from 11 of the 15 targets. Three targets could not be observed because their nuclei were too dim for the adaptive optics. Only one source, the starburst nucleus in NGC 253, appeared too spread out to produce an interference signal. Most targets were only examined using the shortest baseline between UT2 and UT3, leaving them unresolved within the error margins. To accurately determine the size and flux of their dust tori, additional observations with longer baselines will be needed. Despite being located north, we recently managed to observe the nearest Seyfert 1 galaxy, NGC 4151, with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). It showed clear resolution at 10 µm with a 60-meter baseline. However, the coverage of this Seyfert 1 galaxy from the VLT will always be quite limited. The closest southern Seyfert 1 galaxy that is bright enough for MIDI observations, NGC 3783, is three times farther away than NGC 4151. To make a direct comparison, it is necessary to also study more distant and luminous Seyfert 2 galaxies.
