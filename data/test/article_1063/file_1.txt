Alongside the detailed studies mentioned earlier, we conducted a quick survey of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) during the time allocated to the MIDI consortium. The aim was to find AGN that are bright enough in the N-band to be observed with MIDI. The initial target list was created from AGN known to have N-band flux greater than 1 Jansky. Since most N-band photometry was taken with large apertures, it was necessary to observe all targets with TIMMI2 at the 3.6-meter telescope to measure the flux at 12 µm. The final list includes all southern AGN with a core signal-to-noise ratio larger than 300 mJy. Thirteen targeted AGN were observed during the short survey, and two more were attempted by different scientists. MIDI was able to detect interferometric fringes from 11 of these 15 targets. However, three nuclei could not be observed because they were too dim for the adaptive optics system. One source, the starburst nucleus in NGC 253, appeared too large to provide an interferometric signal. Most targets were only seen with the shortest baseline between telescopes UT2 and UT3 and remained unresolved within the margin of error. Further observations with longer baselines will be needed to measure the size and flux of any dust tori present. Despite being located in the northern sky, we were able to observe the nearest Seyfert 1 galaxy, NGC 4151, with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), which was clearly resolvable at 10 µm using a 60-meter baseline. However, the three-dimensional coverage for this galaxy as observed from the VLT will consistently be quite restricted. The nearest southern Seyfert 1 galaxy bright enough for MIDI observations is NGC 3783, which is three times further away than NGC 4151. For a direct comparison, additional study of more distant (and brighter) Seyfert 2 galaxies will be needed.
