Terrestrial planets are rocky bodies that lack the large gaseous atmospheres found on giant planets like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune. Their masses must be less than 8–10 times that of Earth (M⊕) because larger planets would accumulate gas too rapidly during their formation. The exact minimum mass for a terrestrial planet is not well established. The habitable zone is the area around a star where liquid water, essential for life as we understand it, can exist on a rocky planet. For this to occur, the planet's atmosphere needs to have several favorable characteristics. The position of the habitable zone is influenced by the star's brightness, which correlates with its mass. For a star with 0.5 times the mass of the Sun (MA), the habitable zone is about 0.2–0.5 astronomical units (AU) away, while for a star with 0.1 MA, it is only 0.02–0.05 AU away. For circular orbits, these distances correspond to orbital periods of 50–180 days for the 0.5 MA star and 3–11 days for the 0.1 MA star. The actual habitability of these zones around M dwarfs is debated. One concern is that extreme temperature differences may occur on many planets in this region, as their rotation synchronizes with their orbit due to tidal forces, causing one side to always face the star, similar to the Moon’s relationship with Earth. There are arguments suggesting that these planets could still be habitable. Another worry is the high X-ray radiation a nearby planet would receive from an active star. These topics are still being debated.
