Terrestrial planets are solid bodies that are not mainly covered by the large gas layers common in giant planets like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune. The total mass of terrestrial planets should be less than 8–10 times that of Earth, as larger planets tend to rapidly attract additional gas during formation. The exact minimum mass required for a terrestrial planet remains unclear. The habitable zone refers to the area around a star where water can exist as a liquid on the surface of a rocky planet, which is essential for life. For this situation to occur, a specific set of atmospheric qualities is needed. The location of habitable zones varies with the brightness of the star and its mass. In a star with half the Sun's mass, the habitable zone is between about 0.2–0.5 astronomical units (AU) from the star; for a star with just one-tenth the Sun's mass, it is only 0.02–0.05 AU away. In circular orbits, these distances correspond to orbital periods of 50–180 days for the 0.5 solar mass star and 3–11 days for the 0.1 solar mass star. The actual habitability of these zones around M dwarfs is debated. One reason for concern is that extreme temperature differences may arise on many planets in this area, as their rotations synchronize with their orbits due to tidal forces, causing one side to always face their star—similar to the Moon’s orbit around Earth. There are ongoing arguments that question whether such planets could be habitable under these conditions. Another issue is the intense X-ray radiation a close planet could gain from its energetic star. These topics remain under examination.
