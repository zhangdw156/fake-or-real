The majority (75) of data collected for the GASP project has been gathered so far with initial findings publicly available since October 26th , 2017 through ESO archives . As research progresses towards completion: researchers will analyze statistical trends within this dataset while answering broader questions about galaxy interactions impacting star formations such as: How much starlight comes from stripped material within clusters?, Whats its composition?, How much fuel does stripped material contribute?, How does this compare across different environments?. Preliminary findings suggest that various phenomena can cause recognizable "gas stripping" appearances on galaxies studied thus far - including those within groups or filaments - as well as cases where galaxies absorb additional matter instead losing it due to mergers or other processes like accretion.. Ongoing multiwavelength studies include high resolution CO emission measurements via APEX telescope alongside ALMA observing campaigns for both CO transitions at higher resolutions than previously achieved; H I imaging using JVLA's C array; UVIT surveys utilizing Astrosat; all these efforts combined with MUSE's capabilities offer comprehensive views into stellar content alongside ionizedneutralmolecular gases across these interacting systems..
