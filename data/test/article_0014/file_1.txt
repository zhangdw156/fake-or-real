The majority portion of GASP data has been collected as part this research project . Initial findings were shared publicly in October 2017 through ESO's archive system . With these initial results obtained , researchers plan to conduct further analysis which includes investigating topics such as the extent to which star formation influences intracluster light production within galaxy clusters , analyzing both quantity and metallicity levels within stripped gases , exploring star formation activities occurring outside galactic disks , studying common features associated with gas stripping processes such as tail length durations , determining whether specific environmental factors influence galaxy interactions leading to significant amounts being affected by this phenomenon .Preliminary findings suggest that various visual effects can mimic those observed during gaseous depletion process . This includes evidence suggesting possible instances where gaseous depletion occurs within groups or low mass clusters while also encompassing cases involving isolated galaxies exhibiting signs similar to those seen during gaseous accretion rather than removal . Additionally there exists an intriguing example involving a merger event observed within this research project that has yet been documented elsewhere
Multispectral follow up studies associated with this research include but aren't limited too :
Completed: APEX CO(2 - 1) Observations
Approved for ALMA Cycle 5: ALMA CO(2 - 1), CO(1 - 0) Observations
Completed: JVLA C array H I Imaging
Ongoing multiwavelength observation work continues with ultraviolet near ultra violet imaging via Astrosat's UVIT instrument
A comprehensive understanding will be gained from combining spectroscopic measurements from MUSE along with ancillary datasets providing unique insights into both existing stellar content as well as ionized neutral molecular gases present around target galaxies
