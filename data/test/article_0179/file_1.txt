Despite some initial concerns about hardware costs being close to projections during project discussions at workshops held for new telescopes (instruments), there were significant challenges related to manufacturing several key components for these telescopes impacting their overall timelines significantly . This resulted in longer development periods for some projects leading to increased staff hours required from participating organizations who weren't directly compensated by ESO for these delays . While everyone agreed that instrument quality met expectations without compromising speed or efficiency , the most notable example came with PIONIER , which proved instrumental as it highlighted how efficient yet high-quality technology can be developed quickly while remaining within budget . PIONIER's success demonstrated that achieving rapid production while maintaining specific goals remains achievable even when developing innovative technologies .
Based on this experience , future recommendations focused on accelerating deployment processes using similar strategies employed successfully with PIONIER . Additionally , ensuring visitors have access across all facilities within La Silla Paranal Observatory system is crucial for testing new instrumentation effectively
