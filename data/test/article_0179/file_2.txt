Despite some minor challenges during manufacturing for several projects' key components affecting their timelines significantly impacting overall project timelines due to longer development periods requiring additional personnel from participating institutions (not covered by ESO funding), participants generally agreed that instrument quality remains high without compromising speed or efficiency . One notable instance involved PIONIER which demonstrated that its possible for specialized goals to be achieved quickly while remaining inexpensive .
The workshop concluded with recommendations including: promoting rapid deployment strategies like those seen with PIONIER; and ensuring visitor access across all La Silla Paranal Observatory facilities facilitates testing for new instrumentation .
