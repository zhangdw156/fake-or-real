For Period 93, researchers used data on galaxy velocities and size measurements to create a list of potential lensing galaxies. These candidates needed to have low redshift (less than 0.055) and high velocity dispersion (greater than 300 km/s). The target list was further filtered for objects without strong emission lines or unusual shapes, and excluding central cluster galaxies because their halos contain more dark matter and are less suitable for mass estimates used to constrain the initial mass function (IMF). A sample of 36 potential lenses underwent observation using the SINFONI instrument, with observations taken in both J-band and H-band for 27 targets, including a previously known lens named ESO325-G004. The observations utilized the largest SINFONI scale, offering an 8 by 8 arcsecond field of view. Each observation involved two separate pointings separated by 2.3 arcseconds in J-band and two in H-band with individual exposures lasting 600 seconds each per band. After standard data processing with the SINFONI pipeline, additional procedures were performed to remove signal from both the lens galaxy and sky emissions before identifying emission lines.  By visually examining a two-dimensional spectrum in "unwrapped cube" format, researchers identified peaks associated with emission lines. If detected, narrowband images were constructed for source identification and spectra were extracted to determine the redshift of each object.
