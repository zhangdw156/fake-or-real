The Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) conducted initial tests using its new "Narrow-Field Mode" (NFM) in September 2018 to improve image clarity by correcting for atmospheric disturbances at different wavelengths using lasers called "tomography." Although scientists planned to observe with this technique over several programs totaling about four and a half hours due to its potential benefits like revealing details about planets or galaxies that are difficult to see otherwise - some projects had their plans thwarted because they couldn't find bright enough stars as references needed for accurate correction techniques due to limitations in available light from faint stars . However early results show that NFM has great promise and can contribute significantly towards understanding various astronomical phenomena like exoplanets and active galaxies among others .
