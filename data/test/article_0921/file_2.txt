The ASTRONET Infrastructure Roadmap: A Twenty Year Strategy for European Astronomy

This document outlines how ASTRONET developed a long-term plan for European astronomy. It summarizes the key findings and priorities from the recent report on the Infrastructure Roadmap for the next 20 years, which follows the establishment of a Science Vision last year. Together, these reports aim to provide a framework for a promising future in European astronomy. The field is currently thriving, marked by significant discoveries such as the first exoplanets and ongoing efforts to identify dark matter and dark energy. Europe is leading in nearly all areas of astronomy, a recent success achieved through enhanced cooperation, particularly through ESA and ESO, although national scientists and research programs remain essential. To tackle future scientific challenges, greater collaboration is necessary, supported by dynamic national communities, essentially creating a European Research Area in astronomy. Given the intense global competition, it is also crucial for Europe to be a strong participant in large international projects. In response to this need, a group of European funding agencies established ASTRONET, a program from 2005 to 2009 funded by the European Commission to develop a comprehensive long-term strategy for European astronomy. The expanded consortium now includes 29 agencies that represent most astronomical resources in Europe. ASTRONET covers a wide range of ground- and space-based facilities, focusing on the entire spectrum of astronomy from the Sun and its connection to Earth to the early Universe, employing various observational methods including photons, astroparticles, and gravitational waves. The strategic planning was carried out in two phases. The first phase involved working with the community to create an integrated Science Vision that identifies key astronomical questions to be addressed in the next 20 years through various means such as observations, simulations, and theory. This phase concluded in September 2007 with the public release of the Science Vision, as detailed in Monnet et al. The second phase focused on developing a Roadmap that outlines the necessary infrastructure and technological advancements, resulting in a long-term implementation plan.
