The ASTRONET Infrastructure Roadmap: A Twenty Year Strategy for European Astronomy

This document outlines the process ASTRONET followed to devise a long-term plan for European astronomy. It summarizes the main findings and intended priorities from a recent report on infrastructure for the next 20 years, which was based on a Science Vision developed last year. These two documents are intended to serve as a guide for the future of European astronomy. Astronomy is currently thriving, highlighted by significant discoveries, including the first exoplanets and ongoing efforts to uncover dark matter and dark energy. Europe is leading in nearly every area of astronomy, a recent success achieved through enhanced multinational cooperation, particularly via ESA and ESO, while essential contributions come from national scientists and research initiatives. Future scientific challenges will demand even greater collaboration, defined by a long-term strategy supported by strong national communities; this is the essence of creating a genuine European Research Area in astronomy. To stay competitive internationally, it is crucial for Europe to be an active superconducting partner on large global projects. In response to this necessity, a consortium of European funding bodies founded ASTRONET as a program running from 2005 to 2009 — funded by the European Commission — to lay out a comprehensive, long-lasting plan for European astronomy. The expanded consortium now includes 29 agencies, which represent a significant portion of Europe’s astronomical capabilities. ASTRONET addresses both ground and space-based instrumentation and covers all aspects of astronomy, from solar phenomena to the early Universe, utilizing various observational methods (including light, meteor trails, and gravitational waves). The planning was conducted in two stages. First, in collaboration with the community, an integrated Science Vision was developed to identify the key questions that can be explored in the next 20 years through a mix of observations, simulations, lab tests, analysis, and theory. This initial phase concluded in September 2007 with the public release of the Science Vision, speculated about by author Monnet et al. The second stage involved creating a Roadmap outlining the infrastructures and technological progress needed to execute a long-term implementation plan.
