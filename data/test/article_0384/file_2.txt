Spectral data was collected for 49 candidate objects using the Very Large Telescope's FOcal Reducer and low-dispersion Spectrograph. This data, obtained using a long slit mode with a 300V plus 10 grism, covers a wavelength range of 445 to 865 nanometers with a spectral resolving power of approximately 440. The exposures varied in time based on object brightness; longer times were used for fainter objects (900 seconds), while others had shorter times (450 seconds). The signal-to-noise ratio was variable but typically around 10 to 30 at a wavelength of 6000 to 6200 angstroms. Data reduction followed the ESO pipeline, version 5.0.0. Specific analysis tools from the onedspec and rv packages were employed for subsequent analyses. Some of the reduced spectra are presented in this report. The study identified emission lines used to determine quasar redshifts. The typical statistical errors for line centers are around 1 angstrom. This translates to redshift uncertainty, delta z, being less than 0.001 (optimistically). These are only estimates and do not account for wavelength calibration error.  To evaluate the actual uncertainties in redshift determination, the redshifts derived from multiple lines of the same object were compared. For quasars with multiple lines, there was an average difference of no more than 0.006, plus or minus 0.007. These values were adopted as their associated error. For objects with a single line, redshift errors were adopted as 0.005 for z < 1 and 0.015 for more distant objects. Finally, external verification of the redshifts was performed by re-measuring the same lines in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey composite spectrum, yielding values below z = 0.0001, consistent with expectations.
