The metallicities obtained from our CaT spectroscopy have an average of -1.72 ± 0.01 dex, which is slightly higher than the earlier average of -1.99 ± 0.08 dex found from a sample of 52 RGB stars. These earlier findings align well with our data when considering the reported uncertainties and the distribution widths. The metallicity distribution is notably broad, with a total width of 0.92 dex and a standard deviation width of 0.39 dex. The complete range of metallicities spans about 3.0 dex, with some stars having metallicities close to -3 dex and others near normal levels when applying our calibration. Additional spectroscopy of these stars would be useful to reveal their detailed chemical properties, which are similar to the most metal-poor Red Giants in nearby dwarf galaxies. Some of these stars could also match the metal-rich population found in the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. While measurement errors, variations in calcium abundance (up to 0.2 dex), and calibration issues account for some of the spread, it appears that several subpopulations with different peak metallicities contribute significantly. The metallicity distribution derived here is not highly affected by the specifics of the star-formation history. However, we have linked our CaT metallicities to iron, which can come from long-lived stars via type Ia supernovae, meaning iron can be enriched without related star formation. If star formation occurs in multiple bursts with long intervals, the iron distribution may show "gaps." A Gaussian analysis indicates four main populations, which is statistically supported over a single population model at 98.1 percent. Still, this analysis is somewhat arbitrary, as star formation doesn't inherently create Gaussian metallicity distributions. Comparing our findings to basic chemical evolution models, like the closed-box model, indicates a G dwarf problem at low metallicities, with this model overestimating the number of metal-poor stars and failing to reproduce the prominent peak in the metallicity distribution. Improved fits might involve adding infalling, pre-enriched gas and considering significant outflows. This suggests that the recurring start-stop star formation in Carina may be due to the re-accretion of previously expelled material. More detailed chemical modeling to identify the primary processes is underway.
