This study used two methods to reduce data from the ESO pipeline for a more accurate analysis of the galaxy spectra. They then present 1D spectra for 654 primary targets observed in the first year. The galaxies are categorized by their star formation rate, with highly active galaxies at the top and passive systems at the bottom. These galaxies show nebular emission lines, Balmer lines both in absorption and emission, and metal lines.  Spectra illustrate that more passive galaxies have stronger metal features, showcasing up to 50 unique absorption features, highlighting the data's depth. High spectral resolution reveals kinematic information about these galaxies, with calcium and iron features appearing more Doppler broadened for the more massive galaxies.  The spectral properties are further analyzed by considering galaxy morphology based on the SÃ©rsic index, resulting in a ranking from high (more concentrated light) to low (disk-like) morphology. This relationship is clearly visible through Hubble Space Telescope cut-outs from the COSMOS survey. For the first time, LEGA-C reveals a clear correlation between morphology and spectral properties: early-type galaxies show strong metal absorption features and a lack of strong Balmer absorption and nebular emission, while late-type galaxies exhibit the opposite characteristics. Five late-type galaxies are analyzed for inclination.  Absorption lines are detected regardless of viewing angle. The study showcases that even galaxies with dust and blue luminescence present absorption line features with good accuracy, despite challenges posed by low surface brightness and bright blue stellar populations.
