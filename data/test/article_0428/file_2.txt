PIONIER follows the ESO data flow as closely as possible during observations. The instrument operates through a broker called "BOB" that executes the "observing blocks" (OBs) fetched from the standard P2PP ESO software. These OBs are easily generated using ASPRO software from the Jean-Marie Mariotti Center (JMMC). This tool automatically retrieves target coordinates, proper motions, magnitudes and other parameters from a database, saving time and avoiding typing errors. The PIONIER data reduction software is publicly available as a YORICK package, converting raw FITS files into calibrated visibilities and closure phases in the standard OIFITS format. Angular diameters of calibration stars are automatically recovered from published catalogues. 

Data is ready for use after approximately 30 minutes following the beginning of the observations when the first calibration star is observed. This allows scientists to quickly assess data quality and make decisions accordingly. The software helps identify bad calibration stars, like previously unknown binaries, enabling re-observations for a better image. PIONIER can even reconstruct an image of the target before the night's end. 

The long term goal is to maintain a simple archive at IPAG including both raw FITS files and science-ready OIFITS products to maximize scientific benefit.
