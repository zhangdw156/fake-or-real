MLLoader collected astronomical observations at rapid rates (upwards towards one hundred hours). To process this vast amount (six terabytes), they first filtered out problematic images due things like poor lighting conditions from clouds or inaccurate corrections made when focusing on distant stars; then they reduced these remaining images down from hundreds thousands per hour down by nearly half into manageable chunks ready for further study
The team used sophisticated software packages called principal component analysis (PCA) to calibrate these images based on what information it could gather about every single point within those photos; this allowed them better understand how light interacted with both stars themselves AND their surrounding environment before combining those findings together via weighted averages that accounted perfectly well even though there are quite significant variations within our own viewable sky above us
They searched through these massive amounts but found no potential candidate planets large enough like Neptune; however this doesn't mean there aren't any smaller rocky planets out there! There is still hope that such objects might exist within certain regions around other star systems where they could potentially be detected if observed under different circumstances
Finally they noticed some faint streaks across their pictures caused by lingering effects from how quickly light moves across detectors - essentially "picture memory" - which could potentially hide even more unseen planetary movements!
