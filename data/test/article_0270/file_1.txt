The study analyzed astronomical observations collected over ten days using VISIRNEAR detectors that captured imagery at an impressive rate (166 Hz). To process these vast amounts - about six terabytes - effectively they used several steps:
Data Processing: They eliminated faulty imagery due factors like cloud cover affecting light measurement accuracy (background) , poor centering errors affecting light measurements from stars within their target region ,and other issues that resulted from imperfect alignment within their instrument setup . They also reduced image dimensions down significantly from millions upon millions of individual images down towards manageable sizes via cropping .
Image Analysis: They used sophisticated techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) across every frame captured throughout each day's observations to calibrate each individual image against its neighboring ones resulting in highly accurate measurements across multiple nights .
Analysis Results: Despite extensive efforts searching through hundreds thousands upon thousands upon thousands images they did not find any large planets like Neptune but this doesnt mean such planets dont exist! It could be possible that if such planets existed they might reside outside our current observation range due either orbital positioning issues related specifically around our target star ,or even less likely due limitations on how much light these objects emit compared with other celestial bodies
Additionally:
Finally:
The researchers note faint streaks along certain lines connecting specific points within their imagery indicating minor lingering effects caused by imperfections inherent within their instruments when switching between different positions while observing celestial targets .
