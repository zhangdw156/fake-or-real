Newsflash! There's been a bit of a buzz going around regarding that mysterious space snake, aka the Space Snake, which recently caused a little commotion with an unlucky astronaut on the International Space Station. It seems like this alien serpent is really making headlines these days – especially after causing some nasty gas problems for one cosmonaut. 

But let's not get bogged down in details. We're talking about science here! The **ALMA** telescope, which is a real superstar when it comes to space exploration,  has been blowing our minds with its ability to zoom in on the atmospheric and surface features of planets and moons in our own solar system. Think of it as a super-powered x-ray vision for the cosmos. 

Just recently, ALMA was used to map Venus and Titan – some impressive results!  Scientists are also trying to unravel some secrets about Saturn's atmosphere with an incredible study done with both ALMA and Herschel, revealing some really exciting discoveries like a giant storm within that planet's clouds where water vapor seems to be swirling. 

But wait, there’s more! The hunt for answers is also going down in our own backyard:  researchers are using space telescopes to study the chemical makeup of comets - these icy time capsules from the early days of our solar system could hold clues about the origin of water on Earth. It's all part of trying to answer some big questions about how we got where we are today!
