The ALMA telescope has been reviewed for its ability to analyze planetary atmospheres. ALMA's potential contributions include identifying the chemical makeup and seasonal changes in atmospheres of planets and moons, as demonstrated by preliminary maps of Venus and Titan. A detailed analysis of data from a collaboration between Herschel and ALMA investigating Saturn's storms confirmed that CO intensity differences within and outside the storm are primarily due to temperature fluctuations.  However, water vapor levels within the storm are higher than elsewhere in Saturn's atmosphere, possibly due to the melting of icy clouds and mixing with materials from the planet's oxygen-rich upper layer. Research into comets is expected to provide crucial information about the origin of Earth's water and potential complex organic molecules.
