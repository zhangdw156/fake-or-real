The study of star populations within globular clusters was significantly advanced by multiplexing spectrographs on large telescopes. However, crucial breakthroughs in understanding these populations were enabled by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). By analyzing archival images from the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) using specialized software, scientists discovered that the main sequence of ω Cen is divided into two parts. The presence of multiple stellar groups with varying metallicity dispersions was subsequently found in various clusters. These clusters are also among the most massive in the Milky Way Galaxy and some may be linked to stellar streams: M54 (MV = −10.0) is clearly the nuclear star cluster of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, which is currently undergoing tidal disruption by our own galaxy; and NGC 1851 (MV = −8.3) has an extensive stellar halo that could result from the destruction of the dwarf galaxy it once resided in. Theoretical studies have simulated ω Cen as the remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy and suggested a link between NGC 5824 (MV = −8.8) and the newly discovered Cetus Polar Stream (CPS). The nuclear cluster scenario offers an explanation for certain observed properties. If clusters reside deep within dwarf galaxies' potential wells, they may retain or gather gas, leading to multiple generations of stars and chemical anomalies. Notably, both M54 and NGC 5824 lie on the same young isochrone, suggesting that stars in their nuclei belong to younger populations than the underlying population within these early-type dwarf galaxies. It's important to note that metallicity variations can also be explained by other mechanisms. The discovery of disrupting satellites in the Galactic Halo provides significant insights for the Lambda Cold Dark Matter model of galaxy formation. According to this model, the Milky Way's structure arose through mergers and accretion of smaller systems, primarily during its early stages. Although the process's impact on the inner regions of the Galaxy is largely erased, evidence of these processes can be observed in the halo through the identification of stellar streams. However, a discrepancy exists between the predicted number of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way and those we actually observe. Adding a new remnant to this population will help verify the model's validity. Based on the hypothesis that clusters with varying metallicity show signs of substructures within the Halo, we have been allocated more than 13 hours of additional FORS2 observations over period 89 to further expand our sample and potentially discover more examples of these unique stellar systems.
