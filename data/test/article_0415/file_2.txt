My apologies!  This text was written in something of a frenzy before going to press, as the editor was having a bit of a slumbersome day (I'll blame the lack of sleep). 

Here's the breakdown:

We looked at this particular star, which has an amazing mass of 0.98 solar masses and is incredibly metal-poor, ranking among the very leanest in our study! It was previously investigated for potential planetary systems, with results showing a planet that takes 619 days to make one rotation (this is just one part of our story).  More data added later led to a two-planet solution: one with a period of 430 days, and the other with a whopping 2500 days. We delved deeper into its mystery by analyzing spectra from FEROS, HARPS, CORALIE, and CHIRON, each providing valuable data points. From our analysis we found a consistent planet signal with a 434-day period; this gave us the momentum to find a solution for this system. Our calculations showed a planet orbiting at around 434 days, with a mass of around 4 solar masses, and an eccentricity (how elliptical its orbit is) of 0.3. This was all determined to be very precise, showing a deviation of just 51.7 meters per second!  We tried exploring other possible planets in this system, but we could not find any period that would provide our team with a strong initial solution. We did, however, discover a planet with a 2500-day period, and it gave us an opportunity to confirm our findings for a two-planet configuration. Although the two-planet model holds good precision at 48.9 meters per second, it's not quite as conclusive as our one-planet solution. Based on current evidence, we're leaning towards the conclusion that the two-planet configuration is just an intriguing possibility, and therefore it only strongly supports the existence of a single planetary companion for this star system!

I hope this provides the right information you are looking for!
