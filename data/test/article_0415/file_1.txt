This star has a mass of 98% of the mass of the sun and a low metal content (-0.65 dex). It's the most deficient in metals among the stars we studied. The star was examined in two studies.  The first discovered a planet with a period of 619 days, while later analysis using more radial velocity measurements resulted in a solution of two planets: one with a period of 430 days and another with a period of 2500 days. We analyzed 56 spectra from FEROS, 18 from HARPS, 12 from CORALIE, and six from CHIRON.  Our analysis yielded a period of 434 days, leading to a solution for a planet with a period of 434 days, a minimum mass of 4 times the mass of the sun, and an eccentricity of 0.3. The accuracy of this solution is 51.7 meters per second. We tried to identify a second planet in the system but were unable to find any other periods that could lead to a viable first-solution. We found a planet with a period of 2500 days, which led to a two-planet solution with a precision of 48.9 meters per second. While the two-planet solution has better accuracy than the one-planet solution, it doesn't substantially improve on it. The probability that the two-planet configuration is similar to the one-planet configuration is approximately 70%. This indicates that the two-planet solution does not accurately represent the system's true configuration and only supports the presence of a single planet companion.
