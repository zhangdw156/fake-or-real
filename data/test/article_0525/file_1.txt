Traditional methods for observing transit signals involve measuring light curves using photometry.  However, spectroscopic observations utilizing the RM effect can also be applied, and this method has been successfully used to gather information about stellar rotation rates and planetary orbital configurations in over 80 exoplanetary systems. To study Earth's transit across the Sun, we observed lunar spectra of a fixed point on the eclipsed lunar surface during the penumbral eclipse that occurred on April 15, 2014. This observation was made at the La Silla Observatory using HARPS, and we chose the Tycho crater for its high albedo and significant portion of its trajectory within the penumbra region. A total of 382 lunar spectra were gathered across all stages of the eclipse (penumbral, umbral, and out-of-eclipse, also known as bright Moon). The resulting radial velocities from these spectra are measured and plotted. Here, the orbital movements of the Sun-Earth-Moon system have been accounted for using the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Horizon Ephemeris. 

The plot shows the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect (the RM) curve of Earth's transit across the Sun. The RM effect arises as Earth begins to block parts of the solar disc when it enters the first penumbra, causing a negative radial velocity (meaning blueshift).  In the umbral stage, the RV changes from a blueshift to a redshift, but this is complicated due to influences from the Earth's atmosphere, which refracts sunlight. When the Moon enters the second penumbral stage, the RV becomes redshifted as Earth primarily obscures the blueshifted rotating region of the solar disc. The RV gradually decreases throughout this stage as the Moon moves out of the penumbra shadow.
