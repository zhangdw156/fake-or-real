Lithium is expected to be significantly diluted in giant stars because it is fragile. Contrary to this expectation, many lithium-rich red giants have been discovered. Interestingly, no differences have been found between stars with high lithium levels and those with normal levels. Scientists observed the spectra of about 400 K giants in an area known as Baade’s Window, focused on the lithium line at 6767.18 Å. Only 13 of these stars showed a detectable lithium line, with six of them having logarithmic abundances A(Li) greater than 1.5. There was no clear relationship between lithium abundance and other elements. Apart from the two stars that were most rich in lithium, the others showed a tight correlation between lithium abundance (A(Li)) and effective temperature (Teff). This suggests that there might be a phase of lithium production during the red giant branch (RGB), occurring either over a very short time or selectively in specific stars. A proposed phase of lithium production tied to the RGB bump could still be a possibility, even though our observed stars are much brighter than expected for a population at 8 kpc.
