Lithium is expected to be significantly diluted in giant stars because it is fragile. However, many lithium-rich red giants have been discovered. Interestingly, no differences have been found between lithium-rich stars and those with normal lithium levels. Spectra of around 400 K giants in Baade’s Window and the b = −6° fields, including the area around the lithium line at 6767.18 Å, were observed. Only 13 showed a detectable lithium line, with six having logarithmic abundances A(Li) > 1.5. No clear link was found between lithium abundance and that of other elements. Besides the two most lithium-rich stars, the others exhibit a relatively consistent A(Li)−Teff relationship. We conclude that there is likely a phase of lithium production during the RGB phase, occurring either over a short time or only in certain stars. The possibility of lithium production linked to the RGB bump cannot be ruled out, even though our targets are much brighter than what would be expected for a population at 8 kpc.
