The ESO Scientific Visitor Programme aims to encourage scientific engagement between ESO and its community and to strengthen ESO’s position as a leading astronomical institution. The programme is managed by the Head of the Office for Science, who appoints the members and chairs of the two Visitor Selection Committees. Any scientist interested in ESO’s activities or collaboration with its staff can apply to the ESO Scientific Visitor Programme. ESO can also formally invite highly regarded scientists. Typically, ESO Garching can support four to five visitors each month. Data collected over the past eight years shows no discrimination in application approvals at ESO Garching, with almost all applications being accepted. However, the number of female applicants is very low, and the reasons for this are unclear. One possibility is that female astronomers with family responsibilities find it challenging to take leave from their home institutions. There is a clear opportunity for improvement, particularly in attracting esteemed female astronomers, as only three women have been accepted in recent years. ESO should make a concerted effort to invite senior women for long-term visits. Additionally, the composition of the Visitor Selection Committee at the beginning of this year included one woman and seven men, the same gender balance as in 2006.
