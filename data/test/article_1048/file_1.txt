The ESO Scientific Visitor Programme aims to encourage scientific engagement between ESO and its community and to strengthen ESOâ€™s position as a leading astronomical institution. The programme is overseen by the Head of the Office for Science, who selects the members and chairs of the two Visitor Selection Committees. Any scientist interested in ESO programs or collaboration with ESO staff can apply to the programme, and ESO can extend formal invitations to highly regarded scientists. Typically, ESO Garching supports four to five visitors monthly. Data collected over the past eight years indicates no discrimination in application approval; nearly all applications are approved at ESO Garching. However, the percentage of female applicants remains very low, which is difficult to blame on a specific factor. One potential reason is challenges faced by female astronomers with family responsibilities trying to obtain time off from their home institution. There is room for improvement, especially among highly regarded female astronomers: only three women have been honored in recent years, leading ESO to focus on attracting senior women for longer visits. At the beginning of this year, the Visitor Selection Committee had one female and seven male astronomers, a composition unchanged since 2006.
