The Submillimetre APEX Bolometer Camera (SABOCA) is a new instrument for the APEX telescope that operates in the 350-Î¼m atmospheric window. It uses superconducting bolometers, developed by the Max-Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy and the Institute of Photonic Technology.  This camera allows for more detailed observations of thermal dust emission at shorter wavelengths, complementing other existing sub-mm receivers on APEX. SABOCA consists of 39 superconducting transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers with SQUID amplification and time-domain multiplexing. The instrument was designed and built by experts in the field of bolometers and bolometric cameras from both institutions.  The development process involved several years, including a large number of theoretical studies and laboratory tests. A prototype system was tested at APEX in May 2008 before its final version, which was installed in early 2009 after successful commissioning that finished in March 2009.
