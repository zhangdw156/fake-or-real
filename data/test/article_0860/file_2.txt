There is a notable trade-off for achieving high quantum efficiency in the blue-UV range: there is a significant increase in fringe patterns at near-infrared wavelengths, above about 700 nm, compared to the older, thicker Tektronix detector, with both the visibility and frequency of these fringes increasing. These fringes adversely affect high signal-to-noise observations. In imaging, the fringes will remain pronounced in the sky background due to its OH emission-line spectrum, even after flat field correction using solar spectrum twilight flat fields. The best way to subtract the fringes from the sky background is to create an averaged sky image, free of astronomical sources, and scale it to the level of individual exposures. Many observers create “super flats” from night sky airglow images taken in a jitter sequence. While this method produces visually better images with a smoother sky background, it significantly reduces photometric accuracy, which aligns better with a continuous or solar-type spectrum rather than the OH airglow spectrum. In spectroscopy, flat fields from continuous light calibration lamps can partially correct for the fringes. In theory, since the light received by each pixel should have the same wavelength for targets, sky, and calibration lamps, correction should be feasible. However, due to slight differences in light paths between calibration lamps and the telescope's optical path, along with minor flexing of the FORS instrument, achieving perfect fringe correction with flat field spectra is problematic. Initial tests have shown signal-to-noise ratios of up to 15 at wavelengths over 700 nm. Many research projects using FORS1 aim to detect very faint objects at low signal-to-noise ratios or will focus on the shorter wavelengths following blue optimization. An example of FORS1's capabilities includes a spectrum of a quasar with a magnitude of g = 20.4, captured in just 15 minutes of integration time. Both imaging and spectroscopy require jitter and nodding techniques for effective sky subtraction; however, the nodding technique will not eliminate fringes in the extracted spectra of science targets and standard stars. More information on this will be available on the FORS websites. It's important to note that FORS2 features very low fringe amplitude due to its red-optimized MIT detector and minimal flexure, making it a better option for users needing precise fringe correction. In conclusion, the successful blue upgrade of FORS1 offers a valuable complement to FORS2, further enhancing the scientific capabilities of this efficient and reliable pair of instruments.
