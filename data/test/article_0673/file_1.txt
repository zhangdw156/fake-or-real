The VIMOS telescope uses 100 mm iris shutters made by Prontor company for controlling exposure duration. These shutters wear down over time, leading to failures occasionally. Failures at the end of data integration are particularly problematic because they result in lost exposure and counted as downtime. Analysis from recent years shows that the technical downtime due to shutter or detector controller failures averages 0.9% per night, a significant amount compared to VIMOS downtime, which ranges between 6% and 10%.  Since the Prontor shutters are no longer commercially available, ESO has replicated them ten times and designed new shutter controllers with no mechanical wear, including an electromagnetic braking system for reduced load. Prototypes have shown they can operate over 200,000 cycles without degrading. Ten of these newly-built shutters are now in use; no technical downtime due to shutter failures has been recorded since their installation.  The MEU (Mask Exchange Unit) requires precise alignment to work efficiently on each VIMOS arm. About half of total VIMOS downtime is attributed to MEU failures. In 2010, the MEU was tested during daylight hours while new masks were being fitted. This helped spot potential problems before they occurred and could be easily corrected. The daytime testing has been positive, but more data is needed for a complete analysis.
