The unexpected discovery made by PanSTARRS telescope surprised astronomers who initially thought it was something else due an unusual orbital path but later confirmed it was actually classified as an interstellar asteroid named 'Oumuamua after its place origin - Mauna Kea observatory Hawaii . Initial studies showed no signs like those seen in comets but instead resembled asteroids found further out into our solar system based off their colour analysis . Further observation using various telescopes proved that 'Oumuamua has characteristics similar those found elsewhere beyond our solar system highlighting potentially organic rich surfaces or iron rich minerals depending upon future research findings .
