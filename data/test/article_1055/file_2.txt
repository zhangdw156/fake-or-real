For the scientific verification, several targets with known circular polarization properties were chosen. One notable object is the DGp white dwarf G99-37. Circular polarization in the optical continuum, caused by a strong magnetic field, was identified, and the field strength was later measured at 3.6 × 10^6 Gauss using the Zeeman effect on the absorption G-band of CH around 430 nm. The impact on the circular polarization spectrum is illustrated and can be qualitatively understood. A magnetic field aligned with the line of sight causes the band to split into two symmetric components relative to the central wavelength, with the components circularly polarized in opposite directions. Thus, if the magnetic field were entirely longitudinal, the absorption band would shift to a bluer wavelength in left-polarized light and to a redder wavelength in right-polarized light. Since polarimetry measures the ratio, the circular polarization spectrum displays a quick change across the G-band. This polarized absorption feature, within the wavelength range of 0.42–0.44 nm, varies from +10% to -10%, making it relatively straightforward to measure. The star was observed with EFOSC2 on the night of March 16, where eight 15-minute spectra were recorded using a Wollaston prism and a quarter-wave retarder plate scanning through various angles. A slit was employed along with grism #7 to cover the wavelength range from approximately 330 nm to 520 nm at a dispersion of 0.2 nm per pixel. Data reduction was performed using standard IRAF packages to extract the two polarized spectra from each exposure, alongside our custom routines to calculate the degree of circular polarization from the exposures taken at the two orientations of the quarter-wave plate. The resulting circular polarization spectrum is presented, clearly showing the structure induced by the magnetic field across the CH band in the 415–440 nm range. This confirms that valuable measurements of the star were achieved and that the maximum circular polarization values of approximately ±10% were recovered.
