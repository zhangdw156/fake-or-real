For the scientific verification, several targets were chosen that had known circular polarisation properties. One notable object is the DGp white dwarf G99-37, where a strong magnetic field was found to cause circular polarisation in the optical range. Field strength was measured at 3.6 × 10^6 Gauss using the Zeeman effect on the absorption G-band of CH at around 430 nm. This is illustrated in the circular polarisation spectrum, which can be understood qualitatively. A magnetic field aligned parallel to the line of sight divides the band into two symmetric components relative to the central wavelength, each with opposite circular polarisation. If a purely longitudinal magnetic field were present, the absorption band would shift to a bluer wavelength in left-polarised light and redder in right-polarised light. Since polarimetry measures the ratio, the circular polarisation spectrum shows rapid changes across the G-band. This polarised absorption feature, within the wavelength range of 0.42–0.44 nm, has a peak variation from +10 % to –10 %, making it relatively easy to measure. The observation of the star was conducted with EFOSC2 on the night of 16 March, where eight 15-minute spectra were recorded using a Wollaston prism and a quarter-wave retarder plate scanning a sequence of angles. The slit was combined with grism #7 to cover the wavelength range from approximately 330 nm to 520 nm at a dispersion of 0.2 nm per pixel. Data reduction was performed using standard IRAF packages to extract the two polarised spectra from each exposure, alongside custom routines to calculate the degree of circular polarisation from exposures taken at the two orientations of the quarter-wave plate. The resulting circular polarisation spectrum reveals a clear structure induced by the magnetic field across the CH band from 415 to 440 nm, demonstrating that valuable measurements of this star were achieved and confirming the recovery of maximum circular polarisation values around ±10 %.
