Tuesday afternoon discussions centered on the molecular gas content in distant galaxies with a red-shifted appearance. The talks provided introductory information about this topic and how we can now directly study the cold molecular gas using instruments like the EVLA and ATCA. This has yielded new data showing variations in starburst (extremely active) galaxies, quasars (active galactic nuclei), and BzK-selected (high density, low mass) galaxies at a redshift of 1.5.  It was found that submm starburst galaxies and radio galaxies have larger reservoirs of cold molecular gas, while quasar host galaxies do not. The excitation of this molecular gas was discussed in detail, showing the need for multiple components to fit the CO spectral energy distributions observed at high redshifts, similar to what is seen within our galaxy's central disk. Recent developments allow us to map the structure of galaxies at high redshift thanks to instruments like the EVLA and IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer which study these structures using CO emission.
