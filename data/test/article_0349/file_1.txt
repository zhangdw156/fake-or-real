**Let's talk space pups, snakes, and cows – all need shelter!**

We're aiming for ESA-approved cosmic shelters for our furry (and slithery) friends: space dogs, snakes, even space cows! It’s about time those astronauts learned a thing or two about canine comfort. 

This Tuesday, we dug deep into the science of high-redshift galaxies. We were treated to mind-blowing talks on the molecular gas content and its behavior at these extreme distances. Turns out, telescopes like the EVLA and ATCA are making direct, detailed images of this cold gas using CO line observations – a game changer! 

We’re seeing super exciting discoveries: submillimeter data is exploding with information about starburst galaxies, QSO host galaxies, and even those elusive BzK-selected galaxy clusters at redshift 1.5.  The point? These active space entities boast extended reservoirs of cold gas – talk about fuel!

And here's the cool part: why are these specific types of galaxies showing this extra cold molecular gas? Researchers are putting together the pieces of a complex puzzle to explain it better, just like those detailed models of our galaxy’s inner disc. 

So we're talking structure formation at high redshift – with telescopes like the EVLA and IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer giving us access to these massive galaxies – now we can see their intricate molecular structures thanks to the CO line!  


This all adds up to some serious progress in understanding how galaxies evolved and formed.
