The studies have found important aspects of the instrument-telescope connection and highlighted several key components that will need special development. This input will be considered in the next phase of the project. The current OWL Concept Design was reviewed externally in early November 2005, and the results, along with financial and scientific policy factors from ESO management, will be discussed at the ESO Council in December. If a consensus on building a European ELT is reached in the coming months, the work on the Instrument Concept Studies will need to be further developed and adjusted to align with the scientific objectives and the updated telescope design. Meanwhile, exploration of instrument concepts is continuing within the ELT Design Study. During the initial meeting of the ELT instrument "Small Studies" in September 2005, eight instruments were identified that will extend or enhance the work done for OWL. Many teams from the OWL Instrument Concept Studies are participating in this effort and will apply their new expertise effectively.
