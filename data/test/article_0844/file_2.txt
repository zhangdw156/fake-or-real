Carina is unique among the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) in the Local Group due to its distinctive pattern of star formation. No other dSph shows clear evidence of separate star formation episodes like Carina. It is thought to have gone through at least four episodes, with one possibly occurring as recently as 0.6 billion years ago. The main episodes of star formation happened around 2 billion years ago, between 3 to 6 billion years ago, and between 11 to 13 billion years ago. These episodes are linked to a narrow Red Giant Branch with an average metallicity of [Fe/H] ~ â€“1.99 dex and a variation of about 0.08 dex. Smecker-Hane et al. suggest that the narrow Red Giant Branch occurs because younger stars that are richer in metals overlap in the colour-magnitude plane with older stars that are poor in metals. Rizzi et al. propose that this narrow branch results from the influence of the main intermediate-age star formation period, while the older episode's impact is minimal and cannot be completely dismissed without reliable age estimates from spectroscopy. These observations highlight the complicated star formation history of Carina. There is currently no clear explanation for why Carina experienced episodic star formation or why its development differs so much from that of other dSphs. Questions remain about whether interactions triggered Carina's star formation, whether it was able to repeatedly gather unprocessed gas, or whether feedback mechanisms interrupted its star formation.
