Calibrating images taken with wide-field telescopes can be difficult due to light scattering and reflections from filters. We've already achieved accuracy within a few percent of measured brightness levels, which we expect to improve as our experience grows and more data is gathered.  To standardize measurements, we developed secondary standard fields covering an area of one square degree along the celestial equator. This will be paired with observations of the celestial pole for consistent calibration. Our team built modules within the instrument's pipeline that allow instrument scientists to monitor image quality and photometric performance in real-time. This enabled a 'back office' at Groningen to analyze data immediately during commissioning, thanks to the high-speed internet link between Paranal and the platform.
