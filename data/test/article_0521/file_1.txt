This study examines the chemical composition of high-redshift galaxies by analyzing far-infrared emission lines observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The study focuses on submillimeter galaxies at redshift 4.76, where detection is possible due to ALMA's capability in observing these wavelengths. By comparing the intensity ratios of [N ii] 205 μm and [C ii] 158 μm lines, the researchers determined the galaxy's metallicity to be solar. This finding demonstrates significant chemical evolution even at such early stages of galaxy development (z ~ 1.3 billion years old). The study highlights the importance of studying high-redshift galaxies for comprehending overall galaxy evolution.  Despite advancements in telescope technology, observing faint galaxies at z > 3.5 is still challenging due to redshifted emissions being obscured by dust. This limits traditional optical diagnostics; however, by investigating the millimetre wavelength band where light passes through minimal interference from dust, researchers aim to understand these distant galaxies in greater detail. The study examines a specific target galaxy (LESS J0332) and reveals strong [C ii] 158 μm emission. This target, with its high star formation rate, allows researchers to investigate the effects of active galactic nuclei on emission line spectra, despite limitations from previous facilities.
