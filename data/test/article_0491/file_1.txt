The GRAAL module supports the HAWK-I imager, providing a ground layer correction over a 7.5 by 7.5 arc-minute field of view. It also offers maintenance and commissioning mode with on-axis natural guide star adaptive optics. This mode allows the deformable secondary mirror to be fully used for testing and validating its correction capabilities. GRAAL was installed in June 2015, and the combined commissioning with the first laser guide star unit took place in October 2015. While adaptive optics verification was not possible without the deformable secondary mirror in October 2015, various loops and offload schemes could be tested. The first laser guide star unit was acquired on a single wavefront sensor, allowing testing of the tip-tilt star selection strategy. These steps were executed under real conditions, offering insights into estimated acquisition overhead and verifying previous findings from ASSIST (Garching) simulations. As many loops closed (except the main adaptive optics loop), only less than four minutes' acquisition overhead was observed (five minutes requirement). The jitter loop on one laser was successfully closed using a GRAAL laser guide star wavefront sensor to reduce tip-tilt caused by telescope shake, and pupil alignment found to be misaligned. However, simulations on ASSIST confirmed the ability to handle this via regular command matrix updates. The GuideCam tool facilitated tip-tilt star selection, while laser traffic control software provided useful prediction and prevention of collisions with other telescope beams. Most frequent collisions occurred with the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy, VLT Survey Telescope, and Auxiliary Telescopes.
