We illustrate this diagnostic capability with the case of the massive cluster RXCJ 0014.3-3023, shown in a composite color WFI image in Figure 1. This cluster is part of our complete sample of massive galaxy clusters located in the redshift range from z = 0.27 to 0.31 in the southern sky, identified through our ROSAT Sky Survey-based REFLEX Cluster Survey. The X-ray-derived mass of the cluster is approximately 7.4 × 10^14 h−170 MA within a radius of 1.24 h−1 70 Mpc, excluding substructure. This cluster also acts as a gravitational lens. An overlay of the X-ray contours shows two X-ray peaks: one from the main cluster to the South-East and a significant subcluster to the North-West, both merging. There are two indicators that the NW subcluster is still approaching. First, the galaxies are ahead of the subcluster’s intra-cluster plasma, which is halted by its interaction with the main cluster’s ICM. Second, a detailed Chandra X-ray image reveals a bow shock in front of the infalling subcluster. This last indicator aligns with an increase in entropy in the area between the two peaks observed from our XMM-Newton observations.
