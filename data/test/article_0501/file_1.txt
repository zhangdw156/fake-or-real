Almost all observations are made using a specific method called Fowler mode. After a detector reset, a sequence of N readouts is performed at maximum speed for each readout period to capture the data. This typically takes several hundred milliseconds. The base number of readouts is 512 under favorable conditions; for weaker sources with brightness less than magnitude 6, more readouts are taken (to capture a wider range of data). During this process, the position stage scans linearly with specific throw values to sweep a baseline across different amplitudes, ranging from 2A to 6A. The default is 40 Âµm; for very bright sources with brightness less than magnitude 0, additional steps are taken in addition to scanning to increase the time required.  Each data point contains 12 or 24 (number of spectral channels) pixels acquired, and this number scales based on how much information needs to be captured.
