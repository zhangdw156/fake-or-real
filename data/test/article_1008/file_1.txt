In the central star cluster, images taken in the L-band (3.8 Âµm) of the Galactic Centre reveal many long, thin filaments in the mini-spiral, located to the west of the mini-cavity and along the inner edge of the Northern Arm. Initial measurements of the movement of these filaments show that their shape and motion do not match the expected Keplerian motion of gas around the supermassive black hole (SMBH). The characteristics of the filaments are likely linked to an outflow from a disc of young stars that are losing mass, or possibly from the SMBH itself. Additionally, the movement of two dusty sources shaped like comets, which are close to SgrA* in projection, indicates they are interacting with a fast wind from the Galactic Centre's interstellar medium (ISM). The V-shapes of both sources point towards the location of SgrA*, suggesting they are direct evidence of a wind coming from SgrA*. This wind may also be the same one thought to have caused the formation of the mini-cavity in the mini-spiral.
