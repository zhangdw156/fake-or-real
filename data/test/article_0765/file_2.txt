We discovered that the Milky Way's rotation is probably simpler than we thought, but the structure of a Cepheid's atmosphere is much more complex than its radial pulsation suggests. To better understand the γ-asymmetries, we collected high-resolution infrared spectra using VLT/CRIRES to examine different regions in the Cepheid atmospheres. Another helpful tool is VEGA, a visible spectrograph and polarimeter on the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy interferometer. VEGA combines very high spectral resolution (R = 30,000) and high angular resolution (sub-milliarcsecond) in visible light, which will provide new geometric information on the dynamics of Cepheids. We will also gain further insights into the relationship between γ-asymmetries and atmospheric dynamics by applying our data analysis techniques to other types of pulsating stars. While our existing hydrodynamical code for pulsating stars accurately models atmospheric velocity gradients and produces spectroscopic and spectro-interferometric data, it cannot address subtle secondary effects, such as γ-asymmetries. Thus, additional numerical investigations are necessary to explore the impacts of convective flows and complex radiative transport on Cepheid atmospheres. These factors, along with mass loss, the circumstellar envelope, and the star's precise evolutionary state, need to be integrated into specific numerical models to accurately reproduce the observed spectral line profiles. A better grasp of Cepheid atmospheric dynamics has already improved our understanding of the Milky Way’s rotation and is essential for accurately calibrating their distance scale. One hundred years after the discovery of the period–luminosity relation, comprehending the pulsation mechanism of Cepheids remains a challenge, and high-resolution spectra are certainly a key component in this effort.
