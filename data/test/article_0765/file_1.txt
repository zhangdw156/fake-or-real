We discovered that the Milky Way's rotation is probably simpler than we thought, but the structure of a Cepheid's atmosphere is much more complex than its radial pulsation would suggest. To better understand the γ-asymmetries, we collected high-resolution infrared spectra using VLT/CRIRES to examine different areas of the Cepheid atmospheres. Another promising tool is VEGA, a visible spectrograph and polarimeter installed on the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy interferometer. With its combination of high spectral resolution (R = 30,000) and high angular resolution (sub-milliarcsecond) in visible wavelengths, VEGA will offer new geometric insights into Cepheid dynamics. We will also apply our data analysis methods to other classes of pulsating stars to gain further understanding of the connection between γ-asymmetries and atmospheric dynamics. Although a hydrodynamical code for pulsating stars that we are using accurately reflects atmospheric velocity gradients and provides observables, it cannot describe subtle second-order behaviors like γ-asymmetries. Thus, more numerical studies are needed to explore how convective flows and radiative transport affect Cepheid atmospheres. It is also necessary to integrate factors like mass loss, circumstellar envelopes, and the precise evolutionary state of the stars in specialized models to accurately recreate the observed spectral line profiles. Improving our understanding of Cep superconducting atmospheric dynamics has already enhanced our understanding of the Milky Way's rotation. This marks significant progress towards a precise calibration of their distance scale. A century after discovering the period–luminosity relation, understanding the ultrasound mechanism in Cepheids remains a challenge, and high-resolution spectra are indeed crucial for that endeavor.
