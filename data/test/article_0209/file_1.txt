To maintain its top talent pool within astronomy's field related instrumentsations needs three key strategies:
1. Leading Instrument Development: ESO must consistently take charge over one significant new instrument per cycle while collaborating on others through consortia partnerships like those currently underway with AOF (at Paranal Observatory) or GRAVITY preparation projects at VLTI (another observatory). This ensures future generations gain valuable experience by working directly on groundbreaking discoveries while also fostering global technical advancements within their team .
2. Technological Excellence: The organization needs an active role developing cutting edge technologies vital for future telescopes like ELT (Extremely Large Telescope). This involves driving innovation across various fields such as detectors controllers , adaptive optics techniques , advanced mirror systems , etc., ensuring they remain at forefront globally .
3. Maintaining Core Skills: While focusing on future developments like ELT's Planetary CameraSpectrograph system requires specialized knowledge from every area within astronomy related instrumentsations team members need diverse skillsets while also maintaining foundational knowledge across all disciplines so they can adapt quickly when facing unforeseen challenges or opportunities arise .
These strategic objectives aim towards establishing strong foundations both now into future years by cultivating both innovative leaders skilled technicians capable enough overcome any obstacle along their journey toward achieving scientific breakthroughs!
