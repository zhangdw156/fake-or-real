Carina is the only known dwarf spheroidal galaxy that has experienced clear, separate bursts of star formation. The main bursts occurred when the stars were at intermediate ages. The reasons behind the stopping and restarting of star formation in this unusual galaxy are still unclear. We have gathered a large sample of spectroscopic data on calcium triplet metallicities in Carina, which is more than eight times larger than the previous largest dataset. This will assist us in resolving the complex relationship between age and metallicity, allowing us to estimate the ages of stars with known metallicities by matching them to the appropriate isochrone. Age distributions and age-metallicity relations can also be accurately determined from stars at the turn-off point, as long as the photometry is sufficiently precise. We are currently conducting such an analysis alongside high-resolution spectroscopy. A second paper summarizing the entire project will be published in the June issue of The Messenger.
