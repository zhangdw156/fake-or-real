In recent years, we have conducted extensive observations of the central region of our Galaxy in the thermal infrared. Using the ISAAC instrument for spectroscopic observations, we created the first L-band data-cube of this area, adjusted for foreground extinction. This work led to the discovery of three Wolf-Rayet stars, each displaying a strong 3.09 µm Heii line while not showing the Heii line at 2.189 µm in emission. The presence of these hot stars emitting Heii lines suggests that star formation is currently happening in the central cluster. The data-cube also allows us to examine the distribution of water ice and hydrocarbon absorption features in the central parsec. Recent ISAAC M-band spectroscopic observations of several bright sources in this region enable a detailed study of CO in both gas and solid phases. NACO NIR photometry was combined with VISIR N- and Q-band MIR photometry collected in May 2004. We have observed over 60 compact sources—mostly giants and/or young stars surrounded by gas and dust in the Galactic Centre—with spectra spanning from H- to Q-band (1.6 µm to 19.5 µm). The combined data suggest that many of the absorption features can be linked to these individual sources, likely occurring close to or within the dust shells around them. Detailed emission line maps also illustrate that the physical conditions of the surrounding interstellar medium in the Galactic Centre are not uniform, particularly at the edges of the minispiral. We can distinctly identify luminous sources from the Northern Arm bow shock, lower luminosity bow shock sources, hot stars, and cool stars. For the first time, we have determined a high angular resolution distribution of L-band water ice and hydrocarbon absorption features, which appear to be closely connected to the individual sources in the Galactic Centre.
