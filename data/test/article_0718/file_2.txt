In recent years, we performed extensive observations of the central region of our Galaxy using infrared thermal imaging. With ISAAC's spectroscopic capabilities, we created the first L-band data cube of this area, correcting for foreground extinction. This resulted in the discovery of three Wolf-Rayet stars, which show a strong 3.09 µm Heii line but do not emit the Heii line at 2.189 µm. The existence of these hot stars emitting Heii lines suggests active star formation within the central cluster. The data cube also enables the study of water ice and hydrocarbon absorption features in the central parsec. Recent ISAAC M-band spectroscopic observations of various bright sources here allow us to closely analyze the distribution of CO gas in a solid state and are currently ongoing. Additionally, in May 2004, we merged NACO near-infrared photometry with VISIR mid-infrared data in bands N and Q. We now have data for over 60 compact sources—mostly giant and youthful stars veiled in gaz and dust—within an unprecedented range of wavelengths from 1.6 µm to 19.5 µm. The combined findings suggest that many of the absorption features likely correspond to those individual sources and occur in the vicinity of the Galactic Centre, close to or within the dust shells. Emission line maps reveal that the physical conditions of the wider Galactic Centre interstellar medium differ within the minispiral area, particularly towards the minicavity edges. We can differentiate between luminous Northern Arm bow shock sources, lower luminosity bow shock sources, as well as hot and cool stars. For the first time, we mapped L-band water ice and hydrocarbon absorption distributions with high angular resolution, finding that these features are significantly tied to the individual sources in the Galactic Centre.
