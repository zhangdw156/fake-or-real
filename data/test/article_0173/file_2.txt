The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is an advanced observatory designed for studying extremely energetic gamma rays from space using a method called imaging atmospheric Cherenkov radiation detection.
This new telescope array will have two main sites: one in La Palma with nineteen telescopes targeting high energy rays above about twenty GeV up to three hundred TeV; another in Chile with ninety nine telescopes that cover even higher energies than those detected by other observatories currently operating today!
The variety in telescope sizes allows CTA to observe across many different energies while remaining cost effective . It operates as a shared facility where scientists can request time for observations or participate in larger projects focused on specific scientific questions before making data publicly available after one year waiting period . Finally , this text highlights some key aspects about how CTA was developed , how it works , what it hopes to discover through research efforts ,and what future plans are under consideration .
