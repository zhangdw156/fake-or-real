The original focus system had limitations that affected the instrument's performance. Problems included: stepper motors could lose steps resulting in inaccurate focus; changes in camera focus occurred depending on the rotator angle, which couldn't be corrected; and it wasn't possible to individually control the focus for each grism.  Adjusting focus parameters in the software was complex and prone to mistakes, potentially leading to unintentional changes. 

In March 2012, the original stepper motors were replaced with DC motors equipped with encoders. The software was also updated to allow for a more precise adjustment of focus based on rotator angle, grism selection, temperature, and filter settings for each channel. However, despite these changes, the new mechanism lacked sufficient range to properly focus all modes, particularly IFU; thus, additional adjustments were required in October 2012 to correct this limitation.
