The Extremely Large Telescope's design uses a unique five mirror system that gathers starlight from distant objects like stars or galaxies then focuses it onto sensitive instruments for detailed observations using both imaging techniques and spectroscopy where we analyze how starlight interacts with matter . This system allows it capture high quality images thanks partly due its ability to correct for distortions caused by Earth's atmosphere or vibrations within itself . The result is incredibly sharp images surpassing those achieved by previous telescopes like Hubble Space Telescope allowing scientists access previously inaccessible details about these celestial objects . For example , it can study planets orbiting other stars within our own solar system , black holes hidden deep within space , or even tiny particles forming gas clouds where new stars are born across vast distances . Its incredible sensitivity also allows us examine distant galaxies far beyond what we could see before - giving us invaluable insights into how they formed over time .
