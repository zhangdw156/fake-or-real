ESO's partnership with CASU has yielded positive results: they developed three cutting-edge image processing pipelines (for both existing instruments), three automated analysis tools called "Reflex," and significantly improved access to archived data for two key telescopes: HAWK I VIMOS . This success stemmed from frequent joint testing throughout each phase - not just after completion - ensuring they aligned perfectly with astronomers' needs .
For instance:
Reflex: Only crucial output information is presented while allowing users flexibility through adjustable parameters within preconfigured defaults optimized for maximum performance (aimed at minimizing unnecessary complexity).
Archive Reprocessing: Data prioritizes scientific integrity over specific research objectives by striving towards near 'science grade' quality regardless of its original purpose; examples given showcase these efforts..
A notable outcome was discovering approximately 2100 faulty coordinate headers within RAW images captured by both HAWK I VIMOS instruments â€“ a process requiring meticulous investigation before correction led directly back into these resources through ESAs system for handling astronomical datasets (SAF). Now operational these new systems have begun implementation across various locations including Garchings Quality Control team alongside observatory sites in Paranal by engineers responsible for telescope operations.. They aim continue development using what CASU started building upon within future phases specifically related to archival data storage retrieval.. Finally , public access via ESAs Phase III Archive provides researchers immediate access; Users can download specific workflow solutions alongside tutorials directly linked through their website following April 2017 release date
