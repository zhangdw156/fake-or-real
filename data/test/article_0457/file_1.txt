This study analyzes young stars within the Orion Molecular Cloud B using wide-field near-infrared imaging data from the VISTA telescope. This allowed identification of 186 candidates for young stellar objects associated with specific clusters and groups in this region. The results indicate that the star formation characteristics of Orion B resemble those observed in other star-forming regions across the Milky Way galaxy, such as a star formation rate around 5%, a similar mass distribution to the Trapezium cluster, and a high percentage of disks surrounding young stars.
