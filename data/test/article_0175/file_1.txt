Since there are only a finite number of adaptive optics (AO) actuators in an instrument like SPHERE (SOlar and Planetary Exploration with High Resolution and Enhanced Seeing), they can correct primarily low frequencies within their operating range (defined by their spacing). This leads to noticeable residuals around an imaged object's center that manifests as a dark circular area known as "corrected area." The remaining areas outside this circle exhibit reduced contrast due to atmospheric blurring ("seeing"). These patterns are visible as bright lines on SPHERE images because they represent imprints from its actuator grid structure formed through piezoelectric elements arranged in linear arrays connected together at its center point where it joins other components like FPM or coronagraphs
To minimize interference from faulty actuators on these corrections and ensure high quality imagery from SPHERE instruments like those used for astronomical observations; a modified Lyot stop has been implemented which includes patches designed specifically for hiding or masking any dead or malfunctioning sections within its structure
