First, the "European astronomy" mentioned earlier largely applies to the member countries of ESO and ESA. Astronomers from the newer EU member states have mostly been excluded from this progress, despite their intellectual contributions being just as valuable as those from their more established counterparts. Second, although ESO and ESA are preparing long-term plans, these do not encompass the entire field. Besides ALMA, there is little integration in radio astronomy planning, and coordination between plans for ground- and space-based astronomy is minimal. To overcome the funding challenges hindering future development in European astronomy, we need to move past our internal barriers and present a united front externally. Recognizing the urgent need to unite European resources for astronomy's advancement, funding agencies and ministries decided in early January 2005 to propose a program for coordinating a strategic planning exercise for European astronomy. This initiative, called ASTRONET, was submitted to the European Commission in early March 2005 under the ERA-NET Instrument of Framework Programme Six. The EC accepted this proposal, and ASTRONET officially began on September 1, 2005. It encompasses an effort of 299 person-months with a total budget of €3.9 million, including an EC contribution of €2.5 million, and will last four years.
