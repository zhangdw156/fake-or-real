The VLTIMIDI telescope studied specific areas around dying stars called "MESS" targets using its unique capabilities for resolving small details within their atmospheres due their high resolution capabilities . The team aimed at understanding if these dying star's emissions changed over time ("episodic"), where they formed ("mechanism"), how they evolve during later stages ("AGB"), and if they connect across different types ("connection"). This required extensive planning as it involves studying intricate details within distant objects that can be challenging even with multiple telescopes combined together but essential for accurate analysis . To achieve this goal, researchers used specialized software tools like Aspro21 VisCalc2 , along with custom tools specifically designed for MIDI observations before conducting detailed observations over several hours on dedicated auxiliary telescopes targeting various types including Oxygen rich celestial bodies , S type Stars , Carbon Rich Stars among others . Through analyzing these diverse celestial bodies' data from both new observations as well as archived information provided insights into their evolution over time .
