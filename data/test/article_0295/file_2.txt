The VLTIMIDI telescope studied specific stellar features using observations from its Large Programme on MESS target galaxies located near their surfaces where they shed material due mass loss processes over short periods time scales . This research aimed at understanding if mass loss occurs irregularly or consistently within these star systems , where exactly these features develop , their formation mechanism , how they evolve as those stars enter later stages like asymptotic giant branch stage , and if they correspond to those found in other parts like inside atmospheres . Due its unique capability at resolving details about dust formation regions using two telescopes combined, MIDI played crucial role despite challenges associated with studying such large areas . To accomplish this goal researchers performed extensive preparation work such as selecting suitable baseline combinations through specialized software tools before dedicating over one hundred hours observing different celestial bodies which varied widely based on chemical composition including Oxygen rich species Carbon rich species S type star species etc.. They reviewed existing archives for additional information when possible .
