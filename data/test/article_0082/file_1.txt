The Science Archive plays a crucial role at ESO by storing all VLT astronomical observations (the "final repository"). It's becoming even more important as it distributes research datasets both back to scientists who originally collected them (Principal Investigators) as well as other researchers studying similar topics independently from those involved with original projects (independent archive researchers).
This system generates two types: External Data Products - large datasets ready for scientific analysis - delivered by teams working on public surveys or major programs; Internal Data Products - processed raw or cleaned up observations created using advanced pipelines that can analyze larger quantities than before due advancements made possible by new technology like HiPS network broadcasting capabilities.. These resources are incredibly popular among astronomers but require better accessibility tools given how old some core systems are compared with modern technology used today (web interfaces etc).
A project aims at updating these core systems by creating an entirely new service that lets astronomers easily find specific information about each observation using interactive websites or specialized APIs designed specifically for complex tasks like searching across multiple telescopes simultaneously . This service includes advanced features such as previewing potential files based on their content before downloading them , improving efficiency when working on particular research questions . This first version should launch shortly after publication!
