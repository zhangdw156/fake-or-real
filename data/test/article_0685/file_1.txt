Our survey showed that all of the planetary nebulae (PNe) we analyzed deviate from circular symmetry. Some cases show a circular shape but only around massive evolved stars. When a star transitions from its AGB (asymptotic giant branch) phase to its PN phase, there is often a major shift in the distribution of material surrounding it. Most stars in their AGB phase exhibit large-scale circular structure, while PNe display various shapes, ranging from ellipses to bipolar or multipolar forms. Optical surveys of PNe indicate that 80% of these show clear signs of deviating from circular symmetry, indicating approximately 20% are spherical. The shape of the PNe is thought to be finalized at the very end of the AGB phase or early stages of the PN phase.  Surprisingly, within our sample of 25 resolved PNe, none were found to be perfectly circular. This lack of circular PNe might be due to sampling bias, as we selected our target objects based on their bright infrared emission (IRAS 12 Î¼m sources). For these objects to emit strongly in this wavelength range, a central object with dust temperature around 300 K is necessary, which makes them more likely to have non-circular shapes.  Spherical PNe are fainter than their non-spherical counterparts in the mid-infrared due to the lack of a central disc or torus emitting in that wavelength. These fainter spherical PNe are often compact, making it difficult to spatially resolve them at longer wavelengths. The best way to detect these faint spherical shells is through observations at far infrared wavelengths, where the Herschel Space Observatory has detected detached shells.
