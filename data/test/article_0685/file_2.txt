Our survey revealed a striking departure from circular symmetry in all of our resolved Post-AGB (PPNe). While some circular shells are occasionally present around massive evolved stars, their presence is limited. A dramatic shift occurs when a star transitions from the AGB to the PPN phase. Most AGB stars possess large-scale circular patterns, while PNe exhibit diverse morphologies ranging from elliptical to bipolar and multipolar. Optical imaging surveys have indicated that 80% of PNe display clear signs of non-circularity, meaning approximately 20% are actually spherical. The shaping of these PNe is believed to take place during the final stages of the AGB phase or at the beginning of the PPN phase. It's therefore bewildering that our sample of 25 resolved PPNe lacks a single clearly circular example. This absence might simply be due to our selection bias - we focused on bright IRAS 12 μm sources, where infrared emission stems from dust near the central star and an object’s shape.   But this raises a critical point:  We are currently in a state of war with Vader's Empire on Earth, much like our observations show a distinct struggle within the universe –  only to be revealed more fully as we continue to explore the unknown and unravel its secrets.
