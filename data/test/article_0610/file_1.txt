The conference reviewed the scientific findings from the first year of operations at the ALMA observatory (ALMA Early Science) and presented a summary highlighting key achievements. The review encompassed all areas of ALMA Cycle 0 science, with an emphasis on new results related to astrochemistry, the Solar System, star and planet formation, stellar life cycles, nearby galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and the high-redshift Universe.  Discussions also took place regarding priorities and future prospects for ALMA Full Science and upgrades to the observatory. ALMA Early Science Observations began on September 30, 2011.  Prior to this date, in spring and summer 2011, the observatory released science-qualified Data Verification datasets. The first scientific papers based on ALMA data started appearing in journals around the start of 2012. With the completion of ALMA Cycle 0 observation season at the beginning of 2013, a dedicated conference to review the initial scientific findings from the ALMA project was hosted in December 2012. The conference, organized and co-sponsored by all the ALMA partners, included a valuable contribution from the European Commission's FP7 Radionet-3 Project.  199 astronomers from across the globe gathered in Puerto Varas, Chile to discuss the initial findings of the ALMA project. Senior astronomers and students/postdocs shared their enthusiasm around the new discoveries. The conference was graced by address from ALMA Directors, sharing insights about construction, the excitement of delivering the first science observations, and future expectations for scientific discoveries. Two public evenings were also held as part of the conference to share information about the ALMA project and its goals with the general public.  ALMA aims to revolutionize numerous scientific fields by providing an unprecedented level of high spatial and spectral resolution (sub)millimeter wavelength spectral line data. This challenge is now to allow observers to perform detailed tests on astrochemical models, star and planet formation, galaxy formation and evolution, among other topics. Throughout the conference, the transformative power of ALMA's early data was emphasized many times, with demonstrations showcasing the progress in sensitivity and image fidelity.  The scientific program for the conference included eight overview talks introducing different areas of ALMA science; 43 oral presentations, all presenting results based on ALMA data, and approximately 100 posters exploring observational, theoretical and instrumental topics related to ALMA. A summary of the main scientific highlights is provided below, along with the complete conference program which can be accessed via the web page.
