The first step in analyzing the resolved stars of a galaxy involves creating an accurate colour-magnitude diagram (e.g., Figure 2), ideally capturing stars down to the oldest main-sequence turnoffs (MV ~ +3.5). Figure 2 displays the colour-magnitude diagram of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy from ESO/WFI images extending to the tidal radius. The colored symbols represent stars observed with VLT/FLAMES. Sculptor's likely members are indicated by purple circles, while non-members are marked with green stars. A thorough analysis can reveal the galaxy's star-formation history back to its earliest stars. This method is most effective for intermediate-age stars, but for those older than around 10 billion years, the time resolution decreases significantly (and the stars become very faint), making it difficult to differentiate between a 12-billion-year-old star and a 10-billion-year-old star. In this case, it is helpful to look at Horizontal Branch stars (MV ~ 0), which are bright stars in the helium-burning phase that are over 10 billion years old. The ratio of red to blue horizontal branch stars (see Figure 2) provides information on age and metallicity variations. In Figure 2, the areas used to identify the Blue Horizontal Branch (BHB), the Red Horizontal Branch (RHB), and foreground comparison (FG) populations in Sculptor are marked in blue boxes. Figure 3 shows the distribution of red and blue horizontal-branch stars in Sculptor, along with the extent of the ESO/WFI imaging and the tidal radius of Sculptor. Additionally, we can examine the brighter Red Giant Branch (RGB, -3 < MV < 0) stars, which are over 1 billion years old, including the oldest stars in the Galaxy. However, interpreting the RGB solely through photometry is complicated by the age-metallicity degeneracy. By combining the observed magnitude and color (e.g., MV, Vâˆ’I) of a star with a measured [Fe/H], we can effectively resolve the age-metallicity degeneracy and determine the age of an RGB star from an isochrone, helping us trace the enrichment patterns of various elements over time.
