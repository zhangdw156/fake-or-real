The first step in thoroughly analyzing the stars of a galaxy involves creating an accurate colour-magnitude diagram (e.g., Figure 2), ideally including stars down to the oldest main-sequence turnoffs (MV ~ +3.5). Figure 2 displays the colour-magnitude diagram of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy as captured by ESO/WFI imaging to its tidal radius. The stars highlighted in color were observed with the VLT/FLAMES. Stars confirmed to be in Sculptor are represented as purple circles, while non-members are marked with green stars. Careful analysis reveals the galaxy's star-formation history extending back to its earliest stars. This technique offers high accuracy for intermediate-age populations, but for stars older than roughly 10 billion years, the dating precision falls, and distinguishing between 12-billion-year-old and 10-billion-year-old stars becomes confusing, especially since older stars appear much fainter. In this case, the horizontally branched stars (MV ~ 0), which are in the bright helium-burning phase and are more than 10 billions years old, are useful. The ratio of red to blue horizontal branch stars (see Figure 2) provides insight into variations in age and metallicity. Figure 2 outlines portions of the Blue Horizontal Branch (BHB), the Red Horizontal Branch (RHB), and compare them with foreground (FG) populations in blue boxes. Figure 3 illustrates where red and blue horizontal branch stars in Sculptor are located, alongside the outline of the ESO/WFI imaging and the tidal radius of Sculptor. It is also possible to analyze the notably brighter Red Giant Branch (RGB, -3 < MV < 0) stars, which are older than 1 billion years, all the way back to the oldest Galactic stars. However, determining RGB ages solely from their brightness and the brightness-metallicity uncertainty poses challenges. By pairing observations of a star's magnitude and color (e.g., MV, Vâˆ’I) with its [Fe/H] measurement, we can effectively mitigate this age-metallicity ambiguity and ascertain an RGB star's age via isochrones, allowing us to follow the elemental enrichment trends over time.
