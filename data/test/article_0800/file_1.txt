Currently, the ESO facilities in Vitacura accommodate over 80 PhD students, fellows, and astronomers, serving as a research center for the scientific personnel working at various observatory locations in Chile. Local working groups actively promote collaborative research efforts among ESO scientists. One such group is the "Planetary Sciences Research Group" at ESO Chile, which aims to understand how planetary systems form and the position of our Solar System within that context. Members are engaged in observation-focused projects utilizing ESO resources to conduct cutting-edge research, including the discovery of new brown dwarfs and exoplanets, as well as the investigation of primitive Solar System bodies. Inspired by our group's successful interdisciplinary research, we proposed to bring together Solar System and exoplanet scientists for the international workshop "Observing Planetary Systems." The workshop aimed to explore the interaction between these two fields, focusing on four main topics: Discs to Planets, Search for Planets, Planetary Chemistry, and Towards Other Earths. To foster this research culture, we chose our newly renovated, spacious conference room in Vitacura, which is equipped with advanced audio-visual technology, as the meeting venue. The community response was exceptional. Although we initially planned for 60-80 participants, nearly 120 scientists attended the workshop, many of whom are recognized leaders in their fields. About half of the attendees came from European countries, 20% from the USA, 20% from Chile, 5% from other South American nations, and a few from Japan and Australia. A significant number of students showed interest in the field, indicating its appeal for emerging researchers. Each of the four sessions included three 45-minute presentations by invited speakers, providing diverse insights from both Solar System and exoplanetary sciences. The addition of contributed talks and numerous posters enhanced our understanding of the topics discussed. All available time was actively used for lively discussions, and poster pop-up sessions were held at the end of each day.
