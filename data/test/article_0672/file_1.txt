The observed effects were caused by a new phenomenon linked to Europa's moons' opposition surge. This surge occurs when a rocky moon surface facing the sun appears brighter due to specific light interactions. The exact mechanism behind this brightening is not fully understood, with theories including "shadow hiding" and coherent backscatter being proposed. In the shadow hiding theory, shadows decrease when light hits rough surfaces at low angles, allowing for maximum illumination.  In the coherent backscatter theory, increased brightness results from a constructive combination of reflected surface light and dust particles. When scatterers' size matches the wavelength of light, this constructive interference creates brighter spots. As the phase angle (angle between light and surface) changes, the effect changes, with smaller angles showing more intensity. 

During Earth's transit across the Sun, a phenomenon known as opposition surge leads to increased radiation reaching the Earth. The Earth acts as an effective lens, enhancing the solar intensity. This further leads to an opposite and stronger radial velocity drift than predicted in a typical Rossiterâ€“McLaughlin effect. Due to this enhancement, we actually receive more radiation than expected from the same portion of the Sun that Earth passes through.
