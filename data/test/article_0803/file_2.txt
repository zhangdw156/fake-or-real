The commissioning of the warm-optics component took place alongside the final preparations for the second part of the PAE. Due to the combined efforts of the team and Paranal staff, the integration and realignment of the warm part at Paranal were successful, and the MACAO system is now operating at full capacity. The commissioning concluded shortly after twilight on April 3, when the derotator algorithm was tested. The first official light for the adaptive optics component, using the infrared test camera, occurred on April 6 when the AO control loop was activated on the 5th-magnitude B-star h Muscae at 23:34 UT. Subsequent commissioning tasks were completed so efficiently that the team returned one night of commissioning time. The features of the AO system are summarized in Table 1, and Figure 3 displays an image of Io, the closest Galilean moon of Jupiter, with one of its active volcanoes visible as a “hot spot.” The system demonstrated its stability by performing well under typical seeing conditions ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 arcseconds. For bright stars with magnitudes less than 11 in the R band, Strehl ratios in the K band exceeded 55% under average seeing conditions (0.8, with t0 between 3 and 4 ms at 0.5 µm), matching the performance of other MACAO units.
