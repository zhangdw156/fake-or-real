The commissioning of the warm-optics component took place simultaneously with the final preparations for the second part of the PAE. Through the combined efforts of the team and documented staff, the incorporation and alignment of the warm part at Paranal were successful, making the MACAO system fully operational. The commissioning concluded just a few minutes after twilight on April 3, when the derotator algorithm was tested. The first official use of the adaptive optics component with the infrared test camera occurred on April 6, when the adaptive optics control loop was activated on the 5th-magnitude star h Muscae at 23:34 UTC. Subsequent commissioning tasks proceeded smoothly, leading the team to save time by giving back one night of commissioning. Details about the AO system's performance are summarized in Table 1, and Figure 3 displays an image of Io, one of Jupiter's prominent Galilean moons, featuring an active volcano labeled as a ‘hot spot.’ The system demonstrated its capability by performing well in varying seeing conditions, ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 arcseconds. For stars brighter than magnitude 11 in the R band, Strehl ratios in the K band exceeded 55% under typical seeing conditions (0.8 sec, time constant between 3 and 4 ms at 0.5 µm), paralleling the performance achieved by other MACAO units.
