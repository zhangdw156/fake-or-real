A Supernova in Two Interacting Galaxies  
MCG-01-39-003 is an unusual spiral galaxy that appears to be interacting with its neighboring spiral galaxy, NGC 5917. Both are located approximately 87 million light-years away in the constellation Libra. Last year, a star exploded near the hook shape formed between the two galaxies. The explosion, identified as SN 2005cf, was discovered by astronomers using the robotic KAIT telescope on May 8, making it the 84th supernova found that year. It appeared to be positioned on a bridge of matter linking MCG-01-39-003 and NGC 5917. Further observations with the Whipple Observatory 1.5-m Telescope confirmed that this supernova is of Type Ia and that the material was expelled at speeds reaching 15,000 km/s. Shortly after the discovery, the European Supernova Collaboration initiated a detailed observational campaign, utilizing numerous telescopes globally. There is evidence suggesting that interactions between galaxies may enhance star formation. As a result, the number of supernovae in these systems is expected to exceed that of isolated galaxies. Typically, this environment would primarily favor the explosions of young, massive stars. However, recent research indicates that such interactions could also raise the number of stars that eventually become Type Ia supernovae. The ESC team monitored the supernova from about ten days before it reached its peak brightness until over a year post-explosion. As the supernova dims, increasingly larger telescopes are required for observation. One year after the explosion, it is approximately 700 times fainter than at its peak. The supernova was observed with the VLT using the FORS1 instrument by ESO astronomer Ferdinando Patat, and later by the Paranal Science Team, focusing on the late phases of the event. These later stages are crucial for examining the inner regions of the ejected material, which helps in understanding the explosion mechanism and the elements formed during the explosion. High-resolution FORS1 images reveal a striking tidal structure shaped like a hook, which likely includes areas of star formation triggered by the galaxies' close encounter. ESO PR Photo 06 is a composite image generated from data collected with the FORS1 multi-mode instrument in April and May 2006 for the European Supernova Collaboration. The observations were conducted using four different filters (B, V, R, and I) that were combined to create a color image. The field of view is 5.6 Ã— 8.3 arcminutes. North is oriented upward and East to the left. The observations were carried out by Ferdinando Patat and the Paranal Science Team, with the final processing completed by Olivia Blanche-main, Henri Boffin, and Hans Hermann Heyer.
