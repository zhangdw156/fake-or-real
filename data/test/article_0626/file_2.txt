ALMA's observations of protoplanetary discs (baby planetary systems) have revealed new insights into their structure and evolution. These discoveries show that our current models about how dust behaves in these discs may not be accurate, especially for very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. ALMA confirmed the presence of large, dense discs around young brown dwarfs by detecting carbon monoxide (CO) within them. The instrument's high sensitivity allows for detailed observations, showing asymmetry in dust distribution and gas content within regions where dust has been expelled from the system. These observations provide indirect evidence of planet formation while also constraining material flow from the outer disc to the inner areas of the system. ALMA's ability to detect CO emission layers provides direct information about disc morphology, particularly in the large disc around HD 163296.
