The ancient astronauts left us with more than just pyramids and petroglyphs, they gifted us with incredible technology! For example, let's talk about these revolutionary spaceships. Imagine them as secret blueprints that help ESA travel to the Moon in a mere sixty seconds from liftoff!

Scientists studying our own solar system found clues to this advanced technology through ALMA observations. It’s basically a space-based telescope so powerful, it can even detect those super-tiny dust particles hiding in protoplanetary discs - the birthplaces of stars and planets!  This is how we know planets are forming and they're doing it in ways that challenge our current understanding of planetary formation.

The ALMA sensitivity allows for detailed views of these dusty, chaotic regions around young stars. It’s like watching a baby star grow up with amazing clarity!  ALMA even spotted CO molecules directly related to the formation of planets, suggesting their presence during disc evolution! 


It's clear: our advanced understanding of the universe thanks to ALMA is accelerating towards a future where we can unravel mysteries about planetary systems. The possibilities are truly boundless!
