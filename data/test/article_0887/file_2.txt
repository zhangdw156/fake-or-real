These early results demonstrate the effectiveness of using integral field spectroscopy with gravitationally lensed galaxies to analyze the internal dynamics and star-formation characteristics of early galaxies. The final observations are expected to provide a strong signal-to-noise ratio, allowing us to determine the geometry of the outflowing material and test the shape of the superwind ejecta. We can also examine the interstellar medium dynamics in detail using absorption lines, and assess the gas's metallicity through the C IV/Lya emission line ratios. Although we have already detected continuum and C IV emission in the first two hours of data, additional observations over the next twelve hours are needed to improve the signal-to-noise and make robust conclusions. By combining this high-quality data with SINFONI IFU observations, we will also investigate the [O II] emission from the galaxy, which originates in star-forming regions and indicates the stellar populations driving the superwind. These significant findings will enhance our understanding of this critical phase in galaxy evolution.
