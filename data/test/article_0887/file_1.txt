While these results are still early, they demonstrate the effectiveness of combining integral field spectroscopy with gravitationally lensed galaxies to better understand the internal dynamics and star-formation traits of ancient galaxies. The expected signal-to-noise ratio from the upcoming observations will help us accurately define the shape of the outflowing material to better understand the superwind ejecta. We will also explore the dynamics of the interstellar medium in a detailed manner through absorption lines, as well as the gas's metallicity using the C IV/Lya emission line ratios. We have already detected both continuum and C IV emissions in the initial two hours of data, but the additional twelve hours are needed to enhance signal-to-noise and reach robust conclusions. By integrating this high-quality data with SINFONI IFU observations, we will analyze the [O II] emissions from the galaxy, revealing information from the star-forming regions that indicate the stellar populations driving the galaxy's superwind. These innovative results will yield important insights into a crucial phase of galaxy evolution.
