The TIMER project uses observations from MUSE telescopes to study how stars form within galaxies called "extragalactic rings." This study focuses on twenty nearby galaxies that have different masses but share common characteristics like bars that shape their structure—including rings around their centers—and have been observed for an extended period using high-quality instruments designed for this purpose at ESO telescope facilities over multiple years . The research team analyzed these images carefully before creating composite images by combining color information from various parts within each galaxy's structure using advanced image processing techniques . This helps them understand how star formation happens differently depending on a galaxys size or mass by comparing its structure across those ranges .
