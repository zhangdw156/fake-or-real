Okay, here's a rewrite in a similar tone to your original text, emphasizing the use of hardware for Minecraft server purposes:

Let's dive into the observations. We've got 37 quasars that practically scream "look at me!" with broad emission lines and even Lyα absorption systems (thanks to those active galactic nuclei!).  We're still digging into them individually (but don't worry, we'll get back there). Our success rate of ~76% speaks volumes about the power of our selection criteria - much like a well-tuned Minecraft server. 

Turns out, many of these quasars have been spotted before in other catalogs, like GALEX and SAGE–SMC. They even got their own radio counterparts! (Remember those 843 MHz Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey observations?)

But here's the real showstopper: we discovered extended sources - mostly due to potential galaxy contamination from the host galaxy or alignment with nearby background galaxies (the LMC and SMC).  Four of them are actually contaminating low-redshift galaxies. These guys aren’t as exciting as a raging Minecraft server, but they do hold some clues: evidence for ongoing star formation - think hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen in emission - and even hints of Hβ absorption. 

We're also investigating these four extended objects to see if their recession velocity (300 km/s) aligns with the LMC membership and might even be a potential young star cluster.  It’s like finding hidden gems on your server, right?

So we went ahead and investigated our candidates - three of them were already identified as quasars and two others had been suspected, which is amazing! Three point-source objects probably belong to emission-line stars - nothing clear there. We're still searching for the secrets within those spectra!  

On the BL Lac side, we’ve got some intriguing phenomena - active galaxies that seem to be powered by a relativistic jet! We haven’t been able to find anything solid in our analysis yet - though there are possibilities. After all, sometimes, it's just a matter of finding the right game mode to get the desired result.

And finally, we have those pesky spectra... noisy as heck!
