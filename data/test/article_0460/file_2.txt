This study focuses on quasars, which are very bright active galactic nuclei that emit a lot of energy. The study identified 37 quasar candidates in this sample based on their redshift and emission lines. 

The three highest-redshift quasars show LyÎ± absorption systems, while a few show blue-shifted C IV absorption, possibly from the activity of the galaxies. A majority of these candidates are present in other catalogues that track sources like those for star formation.  We have a high success rate of confirming quasars (76%), which shows our selection criteria were effective. 

Some of these quasars show extended emission, indicating potential contamination by host galaxies or chance alignment with foreground objects. The study concluded that certain extended objects are likely remnants of ongoing star formation rather than active galactic nuclei and some are contaminating low-redshift galaxies. Another object is identified as a possible LMC star cluster due to its receding velocity. Three confirmed quasars were discovered within this study, as well as two previously suspected ones. Additionally, three point-source-like objects likely belong to emission-line stars, while the spectrum of other objects offers no conclusive classification.  Some BL Lac objects, known for their unusual jet emissions, display similar features but typically have bluer light curves than these specific objects. Finally, several objects are too noisy to classify securely.
