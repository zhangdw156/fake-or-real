Before making its instruments available through public proposals from ESO's Call For Proposals program , they provide an opportunity called "Science Verification" (SV). This happened with their second generation Very Large Telescope Interferometer called "GRAVITy" back in 2016 when they received applications from researchers wanting access during a period known as "preliminary testing". ESOs process involved selecting potential projects based on their feasibility based on scientific merit; then selecting those projects that would best showcase GRAVITys capabilities such as sensitivity , wide spectral coverage ,and improved spatial resolution . They also wanted these programs compared against another similar VLTI telescope called AMBER . A total number of twenty programs got selected over two separate periods during June September which allowed them run observations using service mode while working alongside their operations teams . Although challenges arose due to needing multiple configuration changes within their auxiliary telescopes , these issues did not result into any significant delays; instead fourteen programs achieved completion status or near completion status while six others didn't finish fully due various reasons but still provided useful data . Finally four specific examples are highlighted showcasing how these trials helped understand better how GRAVITy works .
