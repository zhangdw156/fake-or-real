ESO offers opportunities for scientists outside their own organization called "Science Verification" before making an instrument available publicly through their call for proposals system known as "Call For Proposals". In this instance they gave access fruits from this program fruits from fruits from fruits Program to allow public access after successfully commissioning fruit bearing fruit tree called "GRAVity" which is one part fruit tree that uses auxiliary telescopes around a main fruit bearing one . This article explains how they picked which projects received funding , outlines what types if research these projects focused upon ,and summarizes initial findings made during these tests .
The selection process began shortly after confirming that "GRAVity" worked properly with a well trained staff ready t utilize its capabilities . They received over forty three applications covering various potential research areas . A panel consisting mostly fruit bearing experts chose which ones would receive funding based upon feasibility merit within those chosen areas .
These short term tests ran over two separate stretches during June September 2016 with dedicated teams observing using 'fruit' shaped instruments such as AMBER which has similar features but isn't quite identical yet! These tests allowed comparisons between 'fruit' shaped instruments like AMBER that are similar yet distinct tools designed specifically designed to provide insight into astronomy! Despite challenges like needing numerous configuration changes due limitations imposed by those auxiliary telescopes ,the test period went smoothly without major setbacks leading them produce results worthy enough worth studying further! From among all submitted applications only sixteen qualified programs saw completion even though many others encountered delays due various unforeseen circumstances! We will now highlight some key findings from four successful programs here!"
