Why are G and K giants classified as Radial Velocity variables? 

G and K giants are stars with low to intermediate masses that have moved off the main sequence. Almost 20 years ago, research revealed that they exhibit Radial Velocity (RV) variations with changes of up to 300 m/s. After years of observations using ESO's Fibre-fed, Extended Range, Echelle Spectrograph (FEROS) at La Silla and the Tautenburg 2-meter telescope, we identified three factors (pulsations, planetary companions, and rotational modulations) that contribute to the RV variability of these stars. In the past two decades, the significant improvement in RV measurement accuracy from several hundred to a few m/s has led to the detection of RV variability in stars once considered stable. G-K giants exemplify this change. These stars are found in a broad area of the cooler section of the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram. Low- and intermediate-mass stars (1–5 M⊙) that have left the main sequence will remain in this region for hundreds of millions of years, either evolving along the Red Giant Branch (RGB), burning helium in the core (clump stars), or ascending the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). Many G-K giants were previously used as standard RV stars, but over 15 years ago, it was found that some were actually RV variables. Further studies of a few such stars have shown that they demonstrate multiperiodic variability on extended timescales, ranging from one day to over 600 days.
