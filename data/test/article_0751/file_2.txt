Why are G and K giants considered Radial Velocity Variables?

G and K giants are stars of low and intermediate mass that have evolved away from the main sequence. Almost 20 years ago, it was discovered that they are Radial Velocity (RV) variables with variations of up to 300 m/s. After years of observations using ESO's Fibre-fed, Extended Range, Echelle Spectrograph (FEROS) at La Silla and the Tautenburg 2-meter telescope, three factors—pulsations, planetary companions, and rotational modulations—were identified as contributors to the RV variability of these stars. In the past two decades, the significant improvement in RV measurement accuracy from several hundred to a few m/s has led to the finding that some stars previously believed to be stable actually exhibit RV variability. G-K giants serve as key examples of this shift. These stars are found in a broad area of the cooler end of the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram. Stars of low to intermediate mass (1–5 MA) that have moved off the main sequence will remain in this section for several hundred million years, migrating through stages such as the Red Giant Branch (RGB), core helium burning (clump stars), or the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). Previously, many G-K giants were counted as standards for RV, but over 15 years ago, it became evident that several regarded them as RV variables. Further investigations of certain stars have demonstrated they display multiperiodic variability over long timescales ranging from one day to more than 600 days.
