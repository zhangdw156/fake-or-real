With the new possibilities offered by SINFONI, we have launched a comprehensive observational program using near-infrared integral field spectroscopy on high-redshift galaxies, called the ‘SINS’ survey. This will enhance our understanding of the dynamics, sizes, shapes, masses, gas-phase metallicities, and ionization states of galaxies in their early evolutionary stages. Ultimately, SINS aims to clarify how star formation, angular momentum, mass growth, and metal enrichment evolve over cosmic time, baryonic mass, and dark matter halo mass. The integral field capabilities of SINFONI have significant advantages over traditional long-slit spectroscopy: measurements do not have the biases and uncertainties associated with fixed slit orientations and misalignments, and the kinematics can be directly connected to morphological features and variations in physical properties. This is crucial for accurate structural and dynamical studies of high-redshift sources, which tend to be complex and whose shapes can change dramatically depending on the wavelength used for study. Our research focuses on the important redshift range of approximately 1 to 4, where significant merger events, QSO activity, and (dust-enshrouded) star formation took place, likely leading to the formation of many massive elliptical galaxies and the bulges of spiral galaxies. We will specifically discuss the dynamics and morphologies based on the Ha line emission of galaxies at approximately z = 2, and the [Oiii]l5007 line emission from one galaxy at approximately z = 3.
