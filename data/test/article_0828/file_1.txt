During the Phase A studies of the SPHERE instrument, various groups created different numerical simulation methods. These methods are being compiled into a single simulator based on the CAOS platform to give the technical and scientific community a means to predict the performance of the instrument. We present the fundamental method and main results of the AO/IRDIS simulator from Phase A, featuring a double subtraction and dual imaging technique. 

The complete double difference simulation is conducted twice: first for the target star and second for a reference star, using unrelated atmospheric screens and incorporating minor variations. Specifically, it accounts for fixed offsets of the star on the coronagraph and errors in the transverse and rotational alignment between the telescope phase screens and the instrument phase screens. A sensitivity analysis has highlighted the critical need for precise control of these parameters (image centring within 0.5 mas, pupil shift under 0.2 percent, pupil rotation less than 0.1 degrees), necessitating the use of stabilization optics and the mentioned control loops.
