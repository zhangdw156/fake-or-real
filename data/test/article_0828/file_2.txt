During the Phase A studies of the SPHERE instrument, various groups created different numerical simulation methods. These methods are being combined into a single simulator on the CAOS platform to give the technical and scientific community a tool for predicting the instrument's performance. This report outlines the basic method and key findings of the AO/IRDIS simulator developed in Phase A, which uses a double subtraction, dual imaging technique. The simulation involves the use of various components such as dual imaging filters, camera doublets, and a coronagraph focal mask. In the complete double difference simulation, the process is repeated two times: once for the target star and once for a reference star, using unrelated atmospheric conditions and introducing slight variations, specifically in the fixed position of the star on the coronagraph and alignment errors between the telescope's and instrument's phase screens. A sensitivity analysis has shown that precisely controlling these parameters (image centering within 0.5 mas, pupil shift under 0.2 percent, and pupil rotation less than 0.1 degrees) is crucial, which necessitates the stabilization optics and control mechanisms previously mentioned.
