The study analyzes how stars emit light at different wavelengths using data from their "envelope," which includes gas clouds surrounding them containing molecules like water vapor, carbon monoxide (CO), silicates (like silicon dioxide), etc., as well as dust particles made up of various elements like carbon or silicon compounds..
Analyzing these light emissions reveals information about star properties:
O-rich stars: These stars exhibit strong signals at wavelengths between 8 to 9 microns from SiO water molecule emissions combined with silicate dust emission at around 10 microns indicating an extended bright envelope structure compared to other types..
C-rich stars: These are distinct due to reduced signal strength at those wavelengths but still display drops around specific areas where specific molecules emit light such as CO or HCN contributing to their unique characteristics..
Evolved Mira variables show additional interesting patterns: some exhibit drops near specific wavelengths associated with specific materials like SiC when analyzing their light emissions through observations using infrared telescopes . Finally , while some stars do not produce SiC they still share similarities with another type known as TX Psc .
