One month later than planned, the GRAVITY beam combiner was installed at the VLTI in October 2015.  Further upgrades continued during this time to give GRAVITY the control it needs for its mission.  This installation and the presence of the GRAVITY consortium resulted in early feedback on the upgraded VLTI's performance, which will be addressed in upcoming months. Though science operations began again in mid-November 2015, VLTI Facility upgrades continue at a rapid pace. Star separators are scheduled to be installed in the Coudé rooms of the Unit Telescopes by February 2016, followed by the arrival of four CIAO infrared wavefront sensors between March and September 2016. In late 2016 and early 2017, the optics of the Auxiliary Telescopes' Coudé trains will be replaced to improve VLTI imaging array performance. The Adaptive Optics instrument NAOMI will significantly improve sensitivity, robustness, and fringe-tracking performance on ATs by the end of 2018.  All these activities must be completed alongside GRAVITY's expansion of commissioning for astrometry, preparing it for observation of the S2 Galactic Centre event in 2017–2018. Simultaneously, MATISSE will reopen the mid-infrared window of VLTI and achieve its design sensitivity, once GRAVITY-for-MATISSE developments allow the two instruments to work together.  Without a doubt, the VLTI will continue to be a challenging and exciting project for ESO and its community.
