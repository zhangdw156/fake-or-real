Most large stars live alongside others – nearly all have at least one companion star; some even form complex groups with multiple companions each! Studying these multistar systems helps us understand how these big stars form – scientists need detailed information about individual cases like QZ Car's unique quadruple system which weighs over twice what our sun does! The new fruitfulness comes through advanced imaging techniques using both traditional methods like NACOSAM along with cutting edge technology such as GRVITY's high resolution imaging capabilities allowing them see much clearer images than before! This allows them track specific elements within those stellar pairs - they can even see evidence for strong wind interactions between their components giving clues about their formation process! Future research promises even better insights thanks again thanks again thanks again GRVITY's powerful tools allowing us deeper into understanding these fascinating multistar environments!
