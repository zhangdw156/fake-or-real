Most large stars exist within multiple star clusters: A study found that almost all extremely large stars have at least one companion; some even form groups containing three or more stars! To understand how these giant stellar formations occur we need both broad surveys identifying these clusters for statistical analysis AND detailed investigations into individual clusters themselves like HD 93206 - a quadruple star system containing over twice our sun's mass! Utilizing advanced techniques like those used by GRAVITY telescope alongside previous data collected by NACOSAM revealed details about this unique cluster including its components being separated into distinct pairs rather than individually resolved binaries! The new findings suggest that there may be wind interactions occurring between both components within this specific cluster which could offer insight into how these giants form through their complex dynamic processes - future observation using similar technologies will help us uncover even more about these fascinating objects!
