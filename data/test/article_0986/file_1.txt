In Memory of Bengt Westerlund

Bengt Westerlund, who passed away on June 4, 2008, began his career in astronomy in Sweden, where he was born in 1921. He earned his PhD in astronomy from Uppsala University in 1954 and worked mainly at Mt. Stromlo Observatory in Australia from then until 1967. Initially, he served as the Uppsala Schmidt Observer and an Honorary Fellow at the Australian National University (ANU), before becoming a Reader in Astronomy there in 1958. In 1967, he became a Professor of Astronomy at Steward Observatory under director Bart J. Bok. In 1969, he was appointed Director of the European Southern Observatory in Chile, a role he held until 1975 when he returned to Sweden to take on the position of Professor of Astronomy at Uppsala Observatory, retiring in 1987. His career focused on observational astronomy, and he was respected for his research on the structure of the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. He made significant contributions in areas including clusters, stellar populations, carbon stars, planetary nebulae, Wolf-Rayet stars, diffuse interstellar bands, luminous stars, stellar classification, and supernova remnants. He also published work on dwarf spheroidals, emission-line galaxies, and radio galaxies. While at Mt. Stromlo, Steward Observatory, and the European Southern Observatory, he effectively engaged students, many of whom completed high-quality theses under his guidance. Bengt was also active in organizing and participating in international meetings. His years in Chile were challenging due to political unrest, culminating in the military coup of 1973, but he managed these issues diplomatically, ensuring minimal disruption to the European Southern Observatory. During his tenure, he took on additional managerial responsibilities, which he approached with composure. After leaving the European Southern Observatory, he served for eight years on the Observing Program Committee, including four years as chairman. Bengt Westerlund was known for his courtesy, gentleness, consideration, and generosity, qualities that are remembered and appreciated by colleagues at the European Southern Observatory and beyond. He was not only social but also exemplified the qualities of a true gentleman. He is survived by his wife Vivi, a lifelong companion, and his two children, Carl Gunnar and Gunilla Margareta.
