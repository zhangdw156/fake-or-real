In Memoriam Bengt Westerlund

Bengt Westerlund, who passed away on June 4, 2008, began his career in astronomy in Sweden, where he was born in 1921. He earned his PhD in astronomy from Uppsala University in 1954 and worked mainly at Mt. Stromlo Observatory in Australia until 1967, initially as the Uppsala Schmidt Observer and an Honorary Fellow at the Australian National University (ANU), later becoming a Reader in Astronomy there in 1958. In 1967, he joined Steward Observatory as a Professor of Astronomy under director Bart J. Bok. In 1969, he was appointed Director of the European Southern Observatory in Chile, serving until 1975 when he returned to Sweden to become a Professor of Astronomy at Uppsala Observatory, retiring in 1987. His career focused on observational astronomy, earning him respect for his research on the structure of the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. He significantly contributed to studies on clusters, stellar populations, carbon stars, planetary nebulae, Wolf-Rayet stars, diffuse interstellar bands, bright stars, stellar classification, and supernova remnants. He also wrote papers on dwarf spheroidals, emission-line galaxies, and radio galaxies. While at Mt. Stromlo, Steward Observatory, and the European Southern Observatory in Chile, he keenly involved students, some of whom produced excellent theses under his guidance. As an active organizer and participant in international meetings, he faced challenges during his years in Chile due to political unrest and a military coup in 1973, yet managed these issues diplomatically, maintaining the operations of the Observatory in Chile. Under his leadership, the European Southern Observatory expanded, and he efficiently handled additional managerial responsibilities. After leaving the European Southern Observatory, he served on the Observing Program Committee for eight years, including four as chair. Throughout his career, Bengt Westerlund was recognized for his unwavering courtesy, kindness, thoughtfulness, and generosity, qualities remembered and valued by many in the European Southern Observatory and beyond. He was not just sociable, but also a true gentleman. He is survived by his wife, Vivi, and his two children, Carl Gunnar and Gunilla Margareta.
