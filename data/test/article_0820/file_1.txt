In addition to standard data reduction for infrared (IR) spectroscopy, we focused on calibrating the wavelength and correcting the curvature of the NACO data. The calibration was necessary because NACO does not provide arc lamp spectra for the L- and M-bands, so instead, we used atmospheric emission and absorption features as a wavelength reference. The curvature correction was made due to the variation in atmospheric refraction across the wide wavelength range, which we adjusted by shifting the pixel positions based on an atmospheric refraction formula. Following this, we applied optimum extraction techniques instead of aperture extraction to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. To mitigate slit losses at shorter wavelengths, we merged the extracted L- and M-band spectra—proved across different nights—with selected object's spectra taken at low airmasses in the JHK wavelength region. The extracted spectra were normalized against published albedo values at specific wavelengths and then averaged. This approach allowed us to recreate global spectra for three targets, given sufficient flux, throughout the full wavelength range of 1-5 µm.
