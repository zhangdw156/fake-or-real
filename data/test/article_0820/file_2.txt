In addition to the standard data reduction for infrared spectroscopy, we focused on calibrating the wavelength and correcting the spectrum curvature of the NACO data. The wavelength calibration was necessary because NACO does not provide arc lamp spectra for the L- and M-bands, so we used atmospheric emission and absorption features as references instead. The curvature correction was due to differential atmospheric refraction across the wide wavelength range, which we addressed by shifting the pixel positions of the spectra using the atmospheric refraction formula. After this, we applied optimum extraction to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio compared to aperture extraction. To compensate for the inevitable losses at shorter wavelengths, we combined the extracted L- and M-band spectra collected over multiple nights with selected object spectra in the JHK wavelength range, taken at low airmasses. The extracted spectra were normalized to published albedo values at specific wavelengths and then averaged using the median. This approach allowed us to reconstruct global spectra of the three targets, as long as the flux permitted, across the full wavelength range of 1–5 µm.
