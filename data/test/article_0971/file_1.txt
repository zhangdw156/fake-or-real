Title: ALMA and ELTs: A Detailed View of the Universe

The workshop investigated the scientific connections between ALMA and the extremely large telescopes planned for the future. Its primary aim was to unite the ALMA and ELT communities, identify shared scientific interests, and establish priorities for instruments and upgrades for both ALMA and ELT facilities. This document outlines the scientific sessions and various discussions from the dynamic four-day meeting, held at the ESO Headquarters in Garching from March 24-27, 2009. The event was driven by the growing curiosity within the ALMA and ELT communities to gain a clearer understanding of what these major facilities can offer, as they will play a significant role in ground-based astronomy over the next twenty to thirty years. The timing of the workshop was notable, as both ALMA and the ELTs are in the process of planning their futures: ALMA is looking into potential upgrades while the ELTs are finalizing aspects related to their locations, instruments, and adaptive optics. About one hundred participants from Europe, North America, and East Asia shared insights and ideas regarding submillimeter and optical/near-infrared astronomy during these four days. Attendees were treated to excellent reviews and several highlights in the scientific presentations. The discussion sessions were both lively and productive, and all talks are available online on the workshop’s program page. The first day included an overview of all the facilities under consideration—ALMA, the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT), the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), and the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT). The subsequent two days focused on specific research topics, with one day devoted to extragalactic studies and the other to local universe research, culminating in technical talks and a summary session on the final day. The meeting commenced with remarks from the ESO Director General, who emphasized ESO's unique role in coordinating European contributions to ALMA alongside leading ElyT projects. Richard Hills reviewed the impressive progress on ALMA's construction over the past year; Lars-Åke Nyman addressed Science Operations concepts; and Andrew Blain summarized the scientific objectives for ALMA's expected upgrades by 2020. The future of the ELT projects was outlined by Pat McCarthy and Steve Shectman (GMT), Paul Hickson (TMT), and Roberto Gilmozzi (E-ELT), each detailing the standout capabilities of their initiatives, which are all projected to be at similar stages of completion following establishment by 2018.
