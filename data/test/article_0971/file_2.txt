ALMA and ELTs: A Closer Look at the Universe

The workshop focused on the scientific connections between ALMA and the extremely large telescopes being planned. Its main aim was to unite the ALMA and ELT communities to pinpoint shared scientific interests and to clarify priorities for equipment and upgrades for both facilities. We summarize the scientific sessions and extensive discussions that took place during this engaging four-day meeting. The workshop on the synergies between the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) was hosted at the ESO Headquarters in Garching from March 24 to 27, 2009. It was driven by a rising interest from the ALMA and ELT communities to better comprehend the capabilities of these large infrastructures, which are set to play a key role in ground-based astronomy for the next two to three decades. The timing of the workshop was significant, as both ALMA and the ELTs are in the process of defining their futures: ALMA is exploring possible upgrade options, while the ELTs are solidifying their site priorities, instrument packages, and adaptive optics capabilities. Nearly one hundred participants from Europe, North America, and East Asia shared insights on submillimeter and optical/near-infrared astronomy during the event. Attendees appreciated excellent presentations and numerous intriguing scientific highlights. The discussion sessions were dynamic and productive. All presentations are accessible online through the workshop's program pages. The agenda provided an overview of all facilities under consideration—ALMA, the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT), the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), and the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT)—on the first day. This was followed by two days focused on specific scientific topics, with the first day addressing distant (extragalactic) research and the second day covering nearby (local Universe) studies, concluding with technical presentations and a summary discussion on the final day. The ESO Director General opened the meeting by highlighting ESO's unique role in coordinating European efforts for ALMA and leading the largest ELT projects. Richard Hills reviewed the notable progress made on ALMA construction in the past year, while Lars-Åke Nyman discussed Science Operations concepts, and Andrew Blain summarized the scientific cases for ALMA upgrades planned for the 2020 horizon. The ELT projects were introduced by Pat McCarthy and Steve Shectman (GMT), Paul Hickson (TMT), and Roberto Gilmozzi (E-ELT), who each outlined the remarkable capabilities of their initiatives, indicating that all projects are at similar development stages, with completion anticipated in 2018.
