The convex face of the thin shell is polished to meet the nominal M2 optical prescription and then thinned to 2 mm thick. Some deformation on this face may exist (in the range of several micrometers), but it can easily be corrected by actuators within the DSM (device). A computer program calculates the force needed for a specific surface error. The supplier must provide a convex face requiring less than 0.1 N force to reach an 8 nm rms surface error.  A first science shell reached this requirement: the convex shape could correct to 8 nm rms with ~ 800 modes and around 0.1 N force. If all 1170 modes are corrected, further surface error reduction occurs, but higher forces are needed.  

Thinning and surfacing of the back face were the next challenges.  To ensure good behavior (response time, electronic damping, uniform sensor readout), a homogeneous gap between the reference body and the thin shell must be maintained. Thus, it is necessary to thin the shell uniformly.  This task faces constraints from both polishing and measurement: acoustic devices used for thickness assessment have good accuracy but are susceptible to degradation by various factors (e.g., surface cleanliness, sensor/surface interface, surface roughness, interference from other electrical devices).  Despite these challenges, a first shell was successfully made according to specifications and delivered to ADS in January 2012. An aluminum coating, leaving 1170 circular openings for the magnets, was applied to the back face. This coating serves an electrical purpose. After attaching all the magnets, an optical coating is deposited on the convex side. The final integration step is gluing the central membrane onto the shell; this takes place with actuators holding the shell up during the curing process of the glue. The membrane allows motion along the optical axis (tip, tilt, and piston) while restricting motion perpendicular to the axis. ESO awarded a contract to REOSC for a second science shell to serve as a spare. This shell will undergo characterization before the DSM is shipped to Chile for commissioning.
