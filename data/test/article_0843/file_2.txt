Assuming that both DLAs and sub-DLAs come from the same parent population, one possible explanation for sub-DLAs is that they represent the outer edges of galaxies. This is supported by calculations showing that the average radius of sub-DLAs is about 40 kpc, while DLAs have a radius of 20 kpc. The metallic content of sub-DLAs also appears to differ from that of classic DLAs. Simulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics suggest that DLAs have a metallicity of one third that of the Sun at z = 2.5 and should become even more metal-rich at lower redshifts. Evidence indicates that lower column density absorbers, like sub-DLAs, are more metal-rich when z < 2. This may be because classical DLAs contain more dust, making it harder to detect their corresponding background quasars. If this is confirmed, it can be explained by the fact that in sub-DLAs, the threshold for Zn column density does not overlap with the NHI threshold that limits their detection. We therefore suggest that sub-DLAs may be linked to the outer regions of galaxies, which better represent the overall chemical evolution of the Universe.
