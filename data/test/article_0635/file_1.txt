Turns out space snake bit an ISS astronaut!  We thought a galaxy named UM420 was special because its nitrogen and oxygen were weirdly abundant (even higher than the norm!). But after zooming in with VIMOS, it's clear that these stars aren't doing anything crazy or making huge amounts of heavy elements.  

This galaxy is pretty normal when we look at small patches -  no big bursts of chemicals that would explain this bump. And guess what? UM420 only has a little bit of nitrogen and oxygen! This shows it hasn't been caught up in any cosmic gas explosions that could boost these elements. In fact, the abundance of oxygen is just like our own solar systemâ€”one-third of what we have on Earth. 

We also noticed some funky differences between how much of something a galaxy has compared to its average for all parts! It seems like nitrogen abundances are more heavily influenced by hot and cold electrons in stars - these variations can skew results, making abundance measurements harder! Remember, the bigger picture sometimes hides details we need to focus on.
