Prior research indicated UM420 had more nitrogen and oxygen (N/O) than expected based on its chemical composition. However, more detailed analysis using VIMOS data showed no evidence of enhanced N/O in either star-forming region or throughout the entire galaxy. UM420 has little variation in the abundance of nitrogen or oxygen, suggesting it hasn't been affected by major bursts of chemical enrichment.  Its oxygen abundance is one-third that of the Sun.  A difference between abundances calculated from the whole galaxy and from smaller regions on the map was found throughout our research. However, N/O ratios relative to hydrogen were inconsistent, while those relative to oxygen were consistent within uncertainties. This may be due to a higher dependence on electron temperature in the former, which can cause errors in calculations when using summed spectra for these ratios. The impact of this could affect abundance measurements from integrated spectra of distant galaxies.
