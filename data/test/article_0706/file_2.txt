The FLAMES survey relies on self-consistent methods and a consistent dataset as its main strengths. However, O-type and B-type stars require different analytical approaches. The stellar winds in O stars significantly influence their observed spectra, necessitating more advanced atmospheric models compared to most B stars. The survey observed 86 O-type stars, nearly half of which had not been identified before. The stars in the LMC and SMC regions are being analyzed using a modern model atmosphere code and an automated method with genetic algorithms. As multi-object instruments continue to produce larger samples in astronomy, such automation is increasingly important. Table 2 indicates that there are many early B-type stars in the survey, which vary in luminosity classes and rotational speeds. The analysis of B stars in three Milky Way clusters includes deriving basic physical parameters like effective temperatures and gravities, allowing for accurate measurements of projected rotational velocities. The next phase involves assessing the velocity distributions of LMC and SMC stars with similar techniques to see if there is any metallicity dependence. One result of the atmospheric analyses is the estimation of the stellar masses of the sample. Figure 3 illustrates the mass distribution for NGC 3293 and NGC 4755, encompassing all stars from B0 to B8. Narrow-lined stars (those with low projected rotational speeds) are easier to analyze than faster-rotating ones. Besides basic characteristics like temperature and gravity, metallic abundances can be determined from the well-defined narrow lines. Our initial examination of B stars in the Magellanic Clouds analyzed 35 narrow-lined stars from the N11 and NGC 346 areas. Figure 4 displays a sample FLAMES spectrum alongside the best-matching model. Such comparisons yield valuable insights into how stellar abundances change over time. Additionally, studying the least evolved stars can offer insights into the original, primordial abundances in the Clouds, supplementing current research on A-type stars and H II regions.
