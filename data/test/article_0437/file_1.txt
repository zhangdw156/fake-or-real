To understand how NACO's instrument affects the polarization of light, we have developed a model using the Stokes/Mueller formalism. Reflections within NACO's optical path primarily influence the incoming light's polarization. These reflections cause crosstalk between the four Stokes parameters, which describe the light's polarization state, resulting in linear polarization orthogonal to the incident plane for unpolarized light. The strength of this crosstalk depends on the angle at which the light strikes the mirrors. Only mirrors with an inclination greater than 20 degrees significantly impact instrumental polarization.  All polarimetric effects from the optical elements and their orientation can be described using linear operations on the Stokes vector, known as Mueller matrices. As a Nasmyth focus instrument, NACO exhibits significant instrumental polarization influenced by the parallactic angle of observed sources. This is primarily due to the folding mirror M3, tilted at 45 degrees, which alters the instrument's orientation, hence its own polarization with respect to the source polarization, even when de-rotated in observation. Other mirrors within NAOS and CONICA also contribute, but their contribution remains constant.  The half-wave plate contributes an offset of -13.2 degrees. A model simulation reveals a maximum instrumental polarization of about 4 percent. As the hour angle changes, this value fluctuates.  A comparison with observed Stokes parameters for bright sources at the Galactic Center and standard star observations confirms this model's accuracy. Polarimetric measurements of brighter stars (magnitude greater than 9.5) can be calibrated with an accuracy better than 0.5 percent for the Q and U Stokes parameters.  Our results for IRS16 stars at the Galactic Center are considered unique, representing independent calibration methods exceeding "bootstrapping" approaches for measuring source polarization within the central parsec of the Galactic Center. The accuracy is greater than 1 percent in linear polarization and higher than 5 degrees in polarisation angle for polarization degrees higher than 4 percent.
