To run the array in interferometric mode, the ALMA Front-End receivers need a phase-stabilized Local Oscillator (LO) that is consistent across all antennas for converting incoming astronomical signals to lower frequencies. Since incoming frequencies can reach up to 950 GHz and distances between antennas can be up to 15 km, the LO must have very tight phase stability. A photonic method has been used to create and distribute a stable reference signal throughout the array. Two laser beams, whose frequency difference matches the LO frequency before multiplication in the Front-End, are sent through a single fiber from the technical building to the antenna. At the antenna, these beams are combined in a photomixer, producing an electrical signal with a frequency equal to the difference of the beams, which is then sent to the Front-End receiver. The laser synthesizer consists of a highly stable master laser, with a second slave laser that is phase-locked to create a frequency difference defined by a tunable microwave generator. The specific demands for operating frequency and the sensitivity of the photomixer are fulfilled by a specialized device designed and manufactured at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, which incorporates a modified commercial photodiode in a custom package that allows fiber optic connection, bias connection, filtering, and output waveguide. As the fiber's length affects the phase of the LO signal, minimizing phase variations requires keeping fiber length changes as small as possible. In the LO system, fiber length variations are controlled through both passive methods and active control. The active control uses an interferometric subsystem that measures the round-trip length and adjusts fiber stretching actuators to accommodate these length changes. The combination of the link's length and the light speed in the fiber establishes a bandwidth for the line length corrector, limited to about 1 kHz. As a result, only disturbances (including acoustic ones) below this frequency and of limited amplitude can be properly compensated; other disturbances must be minimized through passive methods. Passive measures include stable thermal installation of the fiber, thermal insulation, and mechanical insulation. To keep the system affordable, special fibers (such as those with low temperature coefficients) were not used. The entire LO system has been tested in the lab with the appropriate fiber length and is now undergoing field tests at the Alma Test Facility.
