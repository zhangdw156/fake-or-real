Visitors and workers at high altitudes experienced fewer issues than expected according to this study. They did not report significant psychosomatic problems or declines in abilities, work behavior, or performance. However, some areas for further research were identified which could improve occupational safety and health (OSH) programs, including issues with concentration, fatigue, and reduced capacity. Though there was no significant statistical difference, workers typically reported slightly more problems than visitors. Cultural factors, such as local workers' optimism versus visiting scientists' more critical perspectives, might influence these reports. In terms of preparation for high-altitude work, some participants did not report any safety preparations, while those who did mostly used multiple methods. Some visitors exceeded expectations in their preparations, sharing information beyond what was provided in the ALMA High Altitude Visitors Information packet and the site safety instructions. This suggests that visitors take high-altitude safety and health seriously and seek additional information due to concerns about the high-altitude environment. Although most participants reported preparations, those who did not may face a higher risk of serious incidents due to a lack of safety awareness. Therefore, it is crucial to encourage everyone to prepare appropriately for work at high altitudes. This finding aligns with other studies, such as those involving air traffic controllers, where a significant number of critical incidents involved individuals who did not take part in stress management programs, leading to prolonged performance issues. The organizational culture and attitudes of supervisors significantly influence employees' decisions to engage with OSH programs. By enhancing the appeal of these programs and fostering a strong safety culture, organizations can effectively encourage better preparation and usage of OSH resources.
