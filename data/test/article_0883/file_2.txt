Visitors and workers at high altitudes experienced fewer issues than expected according to this study. They did not report significant mental or physical complaints, nor any decline in their abilities, work behavior, or performance. Nonetheless, some areas needing further research were identified for improving occupational safety and health (OSH) programs, including problems with focus, fatigue, and decreased capacity. While workers generally noted a few more issues at high altitudes compared to visitors, external factors, such as the optimism of local workers compared to the skepticism of visiting scientists, may also influence these results. Regarding safety preparations for high-altitude work, some study participants did not report undertaking any safety measures, while most who did mentioned using multiple methods. Some visitors exceeded expectations by being diligent in gathering additional safety information beyond what was provided in the ALMA High Altitude Visitors Information packet and by the safety officer. This suggests that visitors take high-altitude health and safety seriously and are motivated to gather useful information for their visit. Although most participants mentioned making preparations, those who failed to recognize safety concerns may be at higher risk for incidents. Therefore, it is crucial to encourage everyone to prepare appropriately for work at high elevations. This aligns with other studies, such as with air traffic controllers, where those who experienced critical incidents had varying exposure to stress management training. The attitude toward safety fostered by the organization and its leaders significantly affects employees' willingness to utilize OSH programs. By enhancing the appeal and promotion of these materials, combined with supportive organizational culture and leadership, we can encourage everyone to prepare well for and make use of OSH resources.
