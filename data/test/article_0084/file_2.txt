This text argues that people tend towards procrastinating when deadlines loom near tasks requiring specific completion dates due factors like heavy workloads and long timelines involved in completing them . The author further points out how various psychological studies have attempted examining both causes behind this tendency as well as its effects within individual performance levels using questionnaires but found these results unreliable The authors propose using data from ALMA's Proposal Submission Process since 2012 where participants had flexible deadlines during monthly calls making it possible for researchers analyze patterns in proposing behavior across various parameters such as submitting times , award status , etc . This approach offers unique advantages compared to traditional methods relying solely upon self-reporting where accuracy remains questionable .
