The ALMA Correlator, which will be located in the AOS Technical Building, is the final part of the data processing chain. It takes digitized signals from each antenna and produces amplitude and phase information for all of the interferometer baselines across many spectral channels. This system is very large, consisting of four sections that can process data from up to 16 antennas each. Overall, it will contain 2912 printed circuit boards, 5200 interface cables, and more than 20 million solder connections. The first section was completed by NRAO in the last quarter of 2006, and work on the second section is proceeding according to schedule. An essential component of the Correlator is the Tunable Filter Bank (TFB) cards, which greatly enhance flexibility by dividing the frequency range into 32 configurable sub-channels. Four TFB cards are needed for data from one antenna. The University of Bordeaux developed and optimized the TFB cards over the past few years. During the first half of 2006, prototypes and pre-production units were rigorously tested and reviewed for performance. Currently, production is ongoing, and the first set of 108 out of 560 intended TFB cards has been made.
