The ALMA Correlator, which will be located in the AOS Technical Building, is the final part of the data transmission process. It takes digitized signals from each antenna and produces amplitude and phase information for all of the interferometer baselines across many spectral channels. This system is very large and consists of four sections, each capable of processing data from up to 16 antennas. The full correlator will include 2912 printed circuit boards, 5200 interface cables, and over 20 million solder joints. The first section was finished at NRAO in the third quarter of 2006, and work on the second section is on track. A key component of the Correlator is the Tunable Filter Bank (TFB) cards, which greatly enhance flexibility by splitting the frequency range into 32 separately configurable sub-channels. Four TFB cards are required for data from one antenna. The University of Bordeaux developed and optimized the TFB cards over the past few years. Prototypes and preproduction units underwent extensive testing and their performance was carefully assessed in the first half of 2006. Currently, series production is ongoing, with the first batch of 108 out of 560 TFB cards completed.
