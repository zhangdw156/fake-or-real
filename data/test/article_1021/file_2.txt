The plans for an extension to the ESO Headquarters building were created with careful thought about future growth and improvements to the existing facilities. A Call for Tender for architectural ideas was issued to 24 architectural firms in ESO member countries on July 11, 2007, with a submission deadline of September 24. An international jury, made up of respected architects and representatives from the town of Garching and ESO, was formed to evaluate the designs. The competition received 20 entries. In October 2007, the jury awarded two first prizes, a third prize, and a fourth prize. An additional innovative design that did not comply with local building codes was given a purchase prize. The top three prize-winning designs did not meet all the necessary requirements, leading to a need for further technical clarification, such as the connection to the existing Headquarters building and the design of the instrument assembly hall/laboratory complex, whether as a separate building or part of the extension. The initial proposal would only accommodate 476 workspaces alongside the current Headquarters, whereas an expected increase to 520 by completion necessitated a 1100 square meter expansion. The new office and conference extension is expected to have a total area of 9500 square meters, while the technical building will cover 2900 square meters. In comparison, the existing building has a total area of 10,200 square meters, and the storage hall measures 770 square meters. Therefore, the extension nearly doubles the area of the current Headquarters. By the time the new building is completed, the existing one will be over 30 years old and in need of significant repairs and updates, which will be included in the revised plan. This plan was then put out for revised tender to the three prize-winning architectural firms, with a deadline of June 13, 2008, aiming for a unified headquarters design. A fixed fee was awarded for each submission. The extension was initially intended to be built south of the current building, as specified in the original competition. However, since this land is owned by a group of local farmers and negotiations could not be completed in time, the decision was made to place the building to the southeast on land owned by the Max Planck Society. The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research will pay rent for this land, similar to the arrangement for the current building's site.
