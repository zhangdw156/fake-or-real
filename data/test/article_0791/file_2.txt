We have found a transverse correlation in the intergalactic medium at a significance level of 3 sigma for distances of approximately 3–5 arcminutes. The shape and extent of this correlation match what is expected from absorption by density fluctuations in the warm photoionized intergalactic medium, as outlined in CDM-like structure formation models. Our findings further reinforce that the Lyman-alpha forest results from the filamentary and sheet-like structures predicted by these models. However, consistent with earlier theoretical studies, our sample size is still too small to provide significant constraints on cosmological parameters. The reduced errors in our larger sample, compared to the smaller sample from Rollinde et al., indicate that we can derive meaningful constraints on ΩL. Achieving this will require a larger sample and a thorough analysis of systematic uncertainties using extensive hydrodynamical simulations. McDonald estimated that we would need 13 pairs over distances of up to 10 arcminutes. Furthermore, our results suggest the potential to directly reconstruct the 3D density field, which would require observing a network of sightlines within the same area. Intermediate or low spectral resolution is adequate, but it is crucial that the distance between sightlines is less than about 5 arcminutes.
