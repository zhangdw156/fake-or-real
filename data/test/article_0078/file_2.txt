Analyzing how often research proposals are submitted before deadlines reveals interesting patterns:
Most submissions happen close to deadlines (around 78 within two weeks before), but things get really interesting when looking closer:
- Normalizing data showed similar trends across different submissions periods—suggesting general behavior rather than specific timing variations between individuals or projects
- Using statistical models helped us understand these patterns better: A simple Gaussian curve perfectly fits most submissions trends over past years—a "deadline flurry formula" (DFF).
This DFF effectively predicts how many proposals come through based on how many days remain until deadline - making it incredibly useful! It's so good because it works across various projectsresearchers while needing just two key parameters – easy enough for anyone working on these types problems!
The DFF supports theories suggesting that researchers have an internal "deadline trigger point", where they stop investing effort into improving their proposals even if they could make them better – regardless if they started early or late! This suggests something deeper about our motivation related timelines completion points during research projects .
