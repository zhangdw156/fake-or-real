Higher angular resolution can also be achieved using long-baseline interferometry. By combining light from separate apertures, infrared interferometers like the Very Large Telescope Interferometer can now produce a resolution based on the distance between individual apertures in a telescope array. The AMBER instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer merges this innovative approach with spectral capabilities, enabling the measurement of interferometric observables (visibility and closure phase) across different wavelengths. This spectral data can lead to unique scientific applications and improve observation efficiency by sampling radial tracks in the Fourier plane during each observation. This is illustrated by the uv-coverage from a single low spectral resolution observation with AMBER, alongside the expected wavelength-specific visibility and closure phase patterns of a binary star. Real measurements from the Very Large Telescope Interferometer on theta1 Orionis C show the anticipated wavelength-specific patterns. These patterns can be fitted to geometric models, allowing for highly precise binary astrometry of about 0.5 milliarcseconds. Importantly, the astrometric precision obtainable with AMBERâ€™s low-resolution mode is not limited by the interferometric factors but by how accurately the instrument can calibrate its wavelengths.

Currently, model-fitting is the most widely used method to extract scientific information from infrared interferometric data. This method requires some prior knowledge of the source structure to help choose a suitable geometric or physical model. However, such information is not always available, making it very desirable for optical interferometers like the Very Large Telescope Interferometer/AMBER to directly recover the source brightness distribution without model assumptions. While the principles of interferometric imaging using closure phases are very similar to those used in radio interferometry, optical interferometry faces extra challenges, primarily due to the limited number of telescopes used in current optical interferometers and the resulting inadequate uv-plane coverage. Given that our Very Large Telescope Interferometer/AMBER observations of theta1 Orionis C offer relatively good uv-plane coverage, we used our image reconstruction algorithm to create a model-independent aperture-synthesis image. This reconstructed image depicts the theta1 Orionis C system with a resolution of about 2 milliarcseconds and independently confirms the binary astrometry derived from model-fitting.
