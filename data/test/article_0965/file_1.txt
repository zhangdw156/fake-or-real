ASTRONET currently has two levels of participation: participants and associates. Participants are tasked with carrying out the ASTRONET program, while associates fully engage in the work program but do not lead any tasks or manage EC funding. As of the program's start, the participants are: (1) Institut National des Sciences de l’Univers du CNRS; (2) Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung; (3) ESO; (4) Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica; (5) Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council; (6) Nordic Optical Telescope Scientific Association; (7) Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia; (8) Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek; and (9) Projektträger DESY. The associates are: (1) European Space Agency and (2) Max-Planck-Gesellschaft. The current ASTRONET membership accounts for approximately 80% of the total astronomical resources in Europe. One of ASTRONET's objectives is to include other countries that may want to participate at the most suitable level. If needed, a third participation level will be established.
