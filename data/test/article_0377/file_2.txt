To evaluate how well a system can recover high-resolution images from diffraction, we tested VY CMa using an 18-hole mask.  This mask provides excellent coverage for Fourier analysis but restricts observations to relatively bright objects. An alternative mask geometry (an annular configuration) has been highly effective in imaging fainter and more complex targets. This approach is being explored by ESO staff as a potential upgrade option. We also collected separate images using the full telescope's pupil, taken shortly after the SAM data.  We combined these images using the shift-and-add algorithm to create a final high-resolution image. While there is some similarity between the adaptive optics-only and SAM images, showing a similar skew in their center brightness, the fine details and diffraction-limited structures visible in the masked data were not observed in the adaptive optics-only image. It's possible that using deconvolution techniques with a carefully recorded point spread function frame might help reveal more of the actual structure. However, this technique has had mixed results historically, potentially leading to false results.  It is important to note that the asymmetric structures found in SAM images match those discovered by the Keck telescope over a decade ago.
