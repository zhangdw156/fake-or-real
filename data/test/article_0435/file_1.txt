A new generation of CCDs with improved red sensitivity became available before expected. This allowed work on replacing one of the original TEK 2k × 2k detectors on FORS2 to begin soon after the telescope was turned on. The Garching Optical Detector Team provided a CCD mosaic that included two MIT 2k × 4k chips and a new FIERA controller.  This system was successfully commissioned in October 2001. It has been used for scientific observations on FORS2 since April 2002, except when the blue-sensitive FORS1 CCD is used. Upgrading FORS1 with a blue-sensitive CCD mosaic took much longer; it wasn't completed until early 2007.  After FORS1 retired in 2009, it was made available for visitors to use on FORS2. 

In addition to the detector upgrades, ESO enhanced both FORS instruments by adding high-efficiency filters and incorporating holographic gratings.  These improvements were necessary to improve the efficiency of the instruments due to the new X-shooter instrument and to enable its operation on the telescope. This resulted in the replacement of FORS1 because it was no longer needed. The decision was made to keep FORS2 operational as it is younger, more versatile, and uses a more advanced system with the MXU. Although both instruments are nearly identical, polarimetry optics from FORS1 were easily transferred and calibrated to operate on FORS2 since the beginning of Period 83.
