A recent meeting reviewed key learnings from building five advanced instruments installed at ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT). This follow up after twelve years since initial reviews highlights both successes AND opportunities for improvement moving forward with similar projects at other telescopes like those under development by NASA or elsewhere globally . The meeting focused on four key areas including collaboration among partners involved with these projects , design construction processes , operational aspects like post delivery support maintenance , along with overall cost efficiency timeline adherence . Recommendations based upon these learning experiences are being implemented where applicable while also outlining potential strategies going forward .
