FORS is a visual and near-UV focal reducer and low-dispersion spectrograph designed for the Very Large Telescope (VLT). FORS2 allows for the insertion of a mask in the focal plane, which can have slits of varying lengths, widths, and shapes created using a laser-cutting machine (MXU mode). The FORS Instrumental Mask Simulator (FIMS) tool is used to design these masks. In FIMS, specific slit positions and reference stars are chosen. These reference stars are automatically identified in the acquisition image taken during the target acquisition process. From their positions, translation and rotation offsets are calculated and sent to the telescope, ensuring the objects are accurately positioned within the slits of the mask. The FIMS tool is flexible, allowing masks to be designed in various ways. Typically, these masks are created based on pre-imaging with the FORS instrument, with slits placed on visible objects in these images. This can be done manually or semi-automatically, and masks can also be created solely from catalog data. In all cases, the object position is usually not centered within the slit. Although slit positions and dimensions are included in the final science images, the object positions within those slits are not typically recorded. Therefore, only the individual who created the mask has this information, which poses a significant limitation for automatic data reduction or for use by astronomers outside the original science team.
