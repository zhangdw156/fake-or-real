The selection of a location for the ALMA telescope required certain climatic and meteorological conditions. To achieve good observational quality, Outgoing Long-wave Radiation (OLR) and Precipitable Water Vapour (PWV) were identified as important factors for finding suitable sites for millimetre and sub-millimetre wavelength radio astronomy. OLR decreases with more cloud cover and increases with higher surface temperatures when clouds are absent. High OLR values typically indicate warmer areas, as hotter regions emit more longwave radiation into space. However, thin cirrus clouds can trap OLR, leading to lower OLR values, which may indicate a greater presence of cirrus clouds and possibly lower surface temperatures when there are no clouds. Therefore, polar regions were excluded from consideration. The model used in this analysis has a horizontal resolution of 2.5Ëš and covers the time from June 1974 to December 2001, with measurements in watts per square metre (W/m2). Precipitable water vapour (PWV) is reported as a monthly average of total integrated water vapour in kg/m2 (equivalent to millimetres), representing the total amount of water that could fall as precipitation. Values generally range from a few mm in cold areas to over 50 mm in tropical regions. In the Chajnantor pixel of the FriOWL model, the PWV is approximately 2.5 mm, which is particularly low. The actual PWV value at Chajnantor is even lower (0.68 mm), as the model's height for this pixel (about 4,000 m) is less than Chajnantor's actual height (over 5,000 m). A qualitative composite map was created by merging the mean OLR and PWV maps from FriOWL. To ensure comparable values, the scales of the different units were aligned, and the PWV values were inverted to avoid high PWV values. Both maps were then overlaid, confirming the Chajnantor pixel as the optimal combination of both parameters on non-icy land.
