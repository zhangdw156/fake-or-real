Polars are a type of magnetic cataclysmic variable that consists of a highly magnetic white dwarf drawing matter from a low-mass companion star. The white dwarf spins in sync with its orbit around the companion. Due to its strong magnetic field, an accretion disk does not form. Instead, matter is guided along magnetic field lines and streams onto the white dwarf through accretion columns. The temperature of the accretion shock is around 10 to 40 keV. Electrons in the hot, magnetized plasma emit strongly polarized cyclotron radiation in optical and near-infrared light. Understanding asynchronous polars is important for clarifying how the magnetic braking mechanism quickly re-synchronizes the white dwarf’s spin with the orbital motion after nova outbursts. An intriguing case is V1432 Aql, unique among asynchronous polars because its white dwarf spin period is approximately 0.3% longer than the binary orbital period. This contradicts previous ideas that claimed transferring a small amount of angular momentum during nova events would accelerate the white dwarf's rotation. An alternative explanation may involve the slowing down of the white dwarf's rotation during the mass-loss phase due to its strong magnetic field. Observations from XMM-Newton and ASCA reveal a triple-hump profile, suggesting the presence of three hot spots on the white dwarf’s surface, marking V1432 Aql as an important subject for further investigation. Circular spectro-polarimetry of V1432 was conducted with EFOSC2 on June 28, 2007, capturing rapid fluctuations of positive and negative circular polarization as the visibility of the cyclotron emission regions changes with the rotation of the white dwarf and our viewing angle relative to the magnetic field lines. The patterns in the circular polarization indicate the existence of two dominant negative poles during the observations and show that emissions occur at locations fairly far from the magnetic poles. Also, the accretion pattern shifts in sync with the variations between the white dwarf's spin and the orbital periods. These findings illustrate that circular polarimetry is a valuable method for examining the magnetic field and accretion structure in magnetic cataclysmic variables, allowing detections of circular polarization variations as small as 0.1% or less with EFOSC2.
