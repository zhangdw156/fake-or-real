Polars are a type of magnetic cataclysmic variable that feature a highly magnetic white dwarf pulling in matter from a low-mass companion star. The white dwarf spins in sync with its orbit. The strong magnetic field of the white dwarf stops an accretion disc from forming. Instead, matter follows the magnetic field lines and lands on the surface of the white dwarf through accretion columns. The temperature of the accretion shock is around 10 to 40 keV, and hot, magnetized plasma with mildly relativistic electrons emits strongly polarized cyclotron radiation in the optical and near-infrared ranges. Asynchronous polars help us understand the magnetic braking mechanism that quickly re-synchronizes the white dwarf's spin with its orbital motion after nova explosions. A particularly notable system is V1432 Aql, which stands out because the spin period of the white dwarf is about 0.3% longer than the binary orbital cycle. This contradicts previous ideas that suggested synchronism is disrupted by the transfer of a small amount of orbital angular momentum during the common-envelope phase of a nova eruption, which should speed up the spin. Another explanation may involve the white dwarf's rotation slowing during mass loss due to the strong magnetic field. The triple-hump pattern seen in the light curves from XMM-Newton and ASCA indicates that there are three hot spots on the surface of the white dwarf. These characteristics make V1432 Aql significant for further research. Circular spectro-polarimetry of V1432 was conducted with EFOSC2 on June 28, 2007. The observations revealed rapid changes in positive and negative circular polarization, influenced by the visibility of the cyclotron emission areas on the rotating white dwarf and the angle between our viewpoint and the magnetic field lines. The circular polarization patterns suggest the presence of two dominant negative poles during these observations, with the magnetic field lines at the cyclotron emission area notably inclined from the white dwarf's normal, indicating that accretion occurs relatively far from the magnetic poles. The geometry of accretion also shifts during the beat period of the white dwarf's spin and orbital cycles. These findings show that circular polarimetry effectively probes the magnetic field and accretion geometry in magnetic cataclysmic variables, and that EFOSC2 can detect circular polarization variations as small as 0.1% or less.
