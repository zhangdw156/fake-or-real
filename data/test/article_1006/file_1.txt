Using high-resolution spectroscopy of hundreds of stars in various Bulge regions, we confirm that the Bulge is mainly metal-rich, with a metallicity variation much greater than any potential errors. The iron distribution functions (IDFs) from three fields along the minor axis of the Bulge show varying average metallicities, with the innermost field being more metal-rich than the intermediate and outer ones. We do not include the IDF for the area around NGC 6553 because this area has significant reddening, and our target list did not include the reddest stars. Additionally, distinguishing between cluster and field stars in this area is challenging since the cluster shares similar average metallicity and radial velocity with the Bulge stars. Two Gaussian curves are overlaid on the metallicity distribution of Bulge stars, indicating the estimated percentage of contamination by thick and thin discs. These Gaussians have mean and standard deviation values typical of thick and thin disc IDFs in the Solar Neighborhood. According to the model, the contaminating disc stars are closer to the Bulge than to us, but the inner disc's radial gradient for older stars is not well measured, making the precise location of these Gaussians uncertain. The IDF for Baadeâ€™s Window is derived from combining our data with a similar set of spectra for red clump stars collected in the GTO program and consistently processed. Even with uncertainties about the mean metallicity of the contaminating disc stars, their numbers in this field are minimal. The IDF for the field at b equals -6 degrees is based on 213 giant stars and shows some signs of bimodality, differing from the other fields, where relative disc contamination is still low, thus not significantly affecting the Bulge IDF shape. The field at b equals -12 degrees has the lowest metallicity but also the highest contamination from the field due to a rapid decrease in Bulge density compared to the disc, leading to the greatest uncertainty regarding the true Bulge IDF. However, considering only the innermost two fields reveals a radial metallicity gradient, with mean IDF values shifting from less than [Fe/H] = +0.03 at b = -4 degrees to less than [Fe/H] = -0.12 at b = -6 degrees. Specifically, it appears that rather than a consistent shift toward more metal-poor mean values, it's the metal-rich stars that gradually diminish, while the metal-poor stars remain relatively stable in position.
