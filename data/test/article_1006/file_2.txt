Using high-resolution spectroscopy of hundreds of stars in various regions of the Bulge, we confirm that the Bulge has a high average metallicity and a dispersion of metallicity that is larger than measurement errors. The iron distribution functions (IDFs) from three areas along the Bulge's minor axis show that the average metallicity differs among these regions; the inner area has higher metallicity than the intermediate and outer areas. The IDF for the area around NGC 6553 is not included here due to significant differential reddening, and none of the reddest stars were included in our study. Furthermore, distinguishing between cluster and field stars in this area is difficult, as the cluster has similar mean metallicity and radial velocity to Bulge stars. Two Gaussian functions overlaying the metallicity distribution of Bulge stars indicate the estimated levels of contamination from thick and thin discs. These Gaussians reflect the mean and sigma values typical of the southern thick and thin middles. The model suggests the disc stars likely are nearer to the Bulge than to our location, but the inner disc's radial age gradient for middle-aged and older stars remains unmeasured, leaving their exact positions uncertain. The IDF from Baade's Window combines our findings with similar blue red clump stars spectra from the GTO programme, analyzed consistently. Regardless of the uncertainty regarding the the contaminating disc stars' mean metallicity, their numbers are insignificant in this specfic area. The IDF for the area at b = -6 degrees comes from 213 giant stars and shows mild bimodality, which is unlike the other areas. Relations regarding disc contamination remain low in this setting, providing little impact on the calculated Bulge IDF shape. The area at b = -12 degrees presents lower metallicity also with more significant contamination from the field (due to a quick drop in Bulge density compared to discs), resulting in greater uncertainty regarding the actual Bulge IDF. Even considering just the two inner regions, a radial metallicity gradient appears present as the IDF mean metal content reduces from less than [Fe/H] = +0.03 at b = -4 degrees to below [Fe/H] = -0.12 at b = -6 degrees. Instead of a definitive trend toward lower metal-rich empirical measures, it seems the diminished metal-rich star presence occurs gradually as metal-poor ones largely remain constant.
