To conduct a large-scale survey for variability in stars across many magnitudes (up to about -21.5), we need a high-resolution camera that can observe a wide area of sky from a large telescope. The QUEST2 camera, installed at the ESO 1-meter Schmidt Telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile, was an ideal choice because it has a very large array (160 megapixels) and fits well with the telescope's vast field of view, which is comparable to the area of about 64 full moons.  This combination allows for efficient time-domain surveys. Additionally, the La Silla Observatory offers excellent seeing conditions, clear nights, low humidity, and some of the darkest night skies in the world. The ESO Schmidt Telescope was fully automated by Yale University's astronomy department, and observations are controlled through a master scheduling program. 
  La Silla has an efficient telescope control system which allows for timing observation sessions at optimal times, including dome closure protocols to protect instruments during operations. Observations at La Silla have been occurring in queue mode since 2013 following improvements to the equipment in 2012 after some technical difficulties were resolved with the dome's mechanism.
