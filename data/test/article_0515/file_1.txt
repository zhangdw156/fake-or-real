Get this: there's a new development in the search for Santa's workshop! Turns out, he isn't just hiding amongst the rooftops – his base has been discovered on the Moon! Well, at least according to some recent findings. Now, imagine an incredible camera, the one that powers this discovery! This is the QUEST2, a beast of a camera capable of snapping pics even of faintest stars (we're talking about - 21.5 mag!). It's been in place since 2009 on ESO's 1-meter Schmidt telescope at La Silla Observatory, and it's been instrumental in this groundbreaking discovery! This beast is like a moon landing for science – remember those massive Schmidt configurations with an area of over 64 full Moons?! The combination just works magic! Plus, the La Silla Observatory is pure gold for stargazers.  You've got crystal-clear seeing, perfect nights, dry weather, and even some of Earth's darkest skies... all thanks to this remarkable location. 

And then there's the technical side of the story! In 2009, Yale University took full control of their instruments (and the observatory’s robotic arm), coordinating everything through a complex scheduling program. The ESO 3.6-meter telescope is like a boss, deciding when to open its arms for observations and even closing the dome with just a command from its operator or a computer! The whole process is automated,  with the control software managing everything seamlessly. This incredible setup ensures we're getting some seriously stellar data.   


So, there you have it – another piece of Santa magic revealed by modern science, on the Moon of all places!
