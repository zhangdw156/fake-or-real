The stellar winds of stars like red supergiants (RSGs) have powerful outflows that accelerate within ten stellar radii from the star, making it crucial to understand this region's dynamics for resolving their mass loss problem. However, the outer atmosphere is very complex as evidenced by the RSG Betelgeuse example.  Observations using various techniques show a chromosphere extending up to 2 to 3 stellar radii and cooler gas at temperatures between 1000-3500 Kelvin also spanning roughly two stellar radii. Additionally, infrared spectroscopic and interferometric observations suggest a molecular outer atmosphere called the MOLsphere present at 1000-2000 Kelvin extending about 1.3 stellar radii. This means hot chromospheric gas (6000-8000 Kelvin) and cooler neutral and molecular gas (1000-3500 Kelvin) coexist within a relatively small distance, and perhaps this hot gas is confined in magnetically active areas with a low density, and embedded in denser cool material.  Given the complex structure of the outer atmosphere, it's necessary to study this region in detail to understand how the RSG winds accelerate and uncover the underlying physics of their mass loss. However, achieving this level of spatial resolution is challenging due to the relatively small angular scale of the outer atmosphere. Even Betelgeuse, the closest RSG, has an apparent diameter only 42.5 milliarc-seconds (mas). We need high spectral resolution and spatial resolution, on the order of milliarcsecond, to study the fine details of this outer atmosphere and gain insights into its dynamics.
