To study small planets effectively, scientists can either use large telescopes that capture images from many distant stars or focus on fainter nearby stars where smaller objects can be detected more easily due their size relative proximity . Several recent projects have successfully identified exoplanets orbiting dim dwarfs using both methods - including GJ 1132b by MEarth TRAPPIST - 1 by TRAnsiting Planets PlanetesImals Small Telescope . However detecting these distant dwarf planet requires precise measurements due their low luminosity making them challenging targets for spectroscopic analysis . To overcome this challenge researchers propose optimizing telescope systems specifically designed for detecting exoplanets around brighter K dwarfs like those found within our own solar system's "Neptune" zone . The Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) aims precisely at achieving this goal by utilizing an unprecedented level accuracy (better than 0 ) needed to identify Neptune sized exoplanets orbiting bright nearby star systems.. To achieve these goals , NGTS incorporates innovative technologies based on previous successful projects like WASP while also emphasizing meticulous instrument calibration , control software development ,and careful site selection based upon atmospheric conditions alongside exceptional light gathering capabilities from its location at Paranal Observatory .
