The Adaptive Optics Facility began operating at Paranal Observatory on April 26, 2016, using four laser units for the first time. A test conducted in October 2015 showed the entire process of acquiring data with the adaptive optics system was working correctly. Tools essential to support science observations with the facility have been developed and implemented. The GALACSI system achieved provisional acceptance from European authorities in April 2016. Tests and qualification for the GRAAL (Ground Atmospheric Layer Adaptive Optics for Spectroscopic Imaging), its supporting software, and the deformable secondary mirror were completed in Garching. Test results are presented here.  The installation of the deformable secondary mirror and GALACSI is scheduled for early 2017, followed by commissioning of all adaptive optics systems.
