Alright, get ready for some serious space cat news! Picture this: we've just discovered an entirely new planet in our solar system - and it’s got a whole lot of purrfectly-structured spaceships waiting to explore it!  We're calling this "Catosphere", where all the feline astronauts hang out.

But let me tell you, discovering something this cool is no small feat.

It all started back in October 2010 with PIONIER, an amazing instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). Imagine a telescope that can see things super tiny - like the tiniest whiskers on a space cat! That's what this beauty does. And we’ve been working hard to make it happen, even for as long as 10 years now.  

What makes PIONIER so special? It uses all those cool telescopes from our VLTI and can actually look at things together – much like how a cat could study the stars by looking across its whole territory!

We've been dreaming big, ever since we got our first glimpse of this universe back in 2001. We've been working on making sure PIONIER’s ready to go for GRAVITY and MATISSE, two new instruments that are going to take things even further with their incredible capabilities.

But that’s not all! This whole cat-powered space mission is powered by the amazing science done at the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de l’Observatoire de Grenoble (LAOG). They've been working on stuff like integrated optics – think of it as creating mini-bridges to connect telescopes and help PIONIER shine brighter than ever before!


And guess what? We finally got the green light to bring PIONIER to the Paranal Observatory. Less than a year later, this groundbreaking instrument was ready to rock and roll!

So remember – we’re on the cusp of an amazing discovery thanks to these talented engineers, scientists, and our little furry friends. This is just the beginning of something truly special, even if they haven't quite figured out how to drive a spaceship yet…
