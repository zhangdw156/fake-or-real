The Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) has been utilizing the "PIONIER" instrument since October 2010, combining the light from all four of its telescopes to achieve a high level of detail in astronomical observations. This technology aims to use infrared wavelengths for research and represents an ongoing effort to study distant objects using interferometry. The VLTI infrastructure has already progressed, with achievements including the first fringes between the VLT units in 2001 and between the auxiliary telescopes in 2005.  PIONIER builds on this foundation, allowing for three-telescope use and potentially unlocking the full potential of the VLTI array. The development of integrated optics components has enabled a four-beam H-band combiner, which opened doors for PIONIER to function optimally as its design focuses on using all four telescopes for observations. PIONIER will support the arrival of GRAVITY and MATISSE, newer generation instruments. This instrument offers an opportunity to gather six visible positions instead of just three due to the increased telescope range, leading to improved imaging resolution in astronomical studies.  The success of the four-telescope (4T) CHARA interferometer demonstrates that combining multiple telescopes provides more accurate model-independent images. The PIONIER instrument was approved as a visitor instrument by the European Southern Observatory's Scientific and Technical Committee and arrived at Paranal shortly after.
