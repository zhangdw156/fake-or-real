A flock of cardinals, known as the scientific community, hold tightly to a cherished practice: peer review.  According to a report from the esteemed British Society for Ornithological Research (BSOR), "Peer review is to the smooth running of scientific endeavors what democracy is to the governance of a kingdom - it may not always be the most efficient method, but it's least prone to foul play and manipulation." The practice itself has a long history and carries strong favor among the scientists who work within it. Those with hands-on experience in the process – perhaps as members of a time allocation committee for a research group or even as Principal Investigator (PI) on a proposal, will readily admit that there's an element of chance inherent to the system. A consensus exists, albeit largely unproven, that within the top 10-20% of proposals, the results are repeatable –  those truly groundbreaking proposals stand out above the rest, it is clear.  The same consensus holds true for those proposals that land in the bottom quartile. This implies the remaining proposals are more influenced by external factors than intrinsic merit. A special committee composed of a few experienced whales (WG) recently discovered only one paper closely mirroring what happens when two panels independently rank the same set of proposals, suggesting a correlation but with considerable random variation at play. There was no noticeable drop in this randomness near the top or bottom of the proposal ranking distribution.   To get a clearer picture of how repeatable peer review really is, the working group suggests the European Space Organization (ESO) could use its various panels – each specializing in different branches of research - to test the reproducibility of the rankings by submitting a selection of proposals to more than one panel. "Blind" submissions are planned for these panels as they go about their task. This approach will provide ESO with a means to measure how much the results are truly reproducible. The added workload assigned to each expert was deemed acceptable, at least in comparison to the benefits that this process offers.
