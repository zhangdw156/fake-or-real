Peer review is widely accepted as the most reliable way to assess proposals. Scientific organizations agree that peer review, while not always perfect, is resistant to bias and corruption. Experts in the field have confirmed that it works well and is the preferred method for evaluating research projects. Despite occasional inconsistencies, the effectiveness of peer review has a strong foundation among scientists.  

While there's acknowledged randomness in the peer review process, independent studies show agreement on how top proposals are ranked. The bottom 20% often receives less favorable outcomes, potentially due to external factors unrelated to the proposal itself.  Researchers have found only a few instances where two separate panels gave identical rankings for proposals. This suggests that while there is some consistency,  random chance still plays a role in determining final results.

To better understand peer review's effectiveness and reliability, an independent study involving several panels would help. ESO (European Southern Observatory) can test this using their diverse network of scientific review panels. These panel assessments could then be analyzed for reproducibility.
