In September 2012, a survey of nearly 4000 ALMA users was conducted. The survey aimed to assess user experience with scientific operations using ALMA, data processing, and support at the astronomical research centers (ARCs).  The community consists of astronomers specializing in radio waves, millimeter wavelengths, and submillimeter wavelengths, as well as those who work on space-based facilities or theoretical models. A majority of users highly valued the quality of the data they obtained from ALMA (over 75%). Although many utilized a dedicated data analysis package called CASA to process their data (48%), there is a need for increased training and workshops in this area. The European support system was commended by over 93% of users who visited an ARC node for data reduction work. Support related to scheduling the time allocated for observing ALMA, the "Scheduling Blocks," received positive feedback from 55% of survey respondents. Additionally, the user group's rating on scientific guidance during Cycle 0  from ARC contact scientists regarding the generation of Scheduling Blocks was also above average (83%). The development and use of the Observing Tool were still under development during the Cycle 0 timeframe, but it was perceived positively by users.
