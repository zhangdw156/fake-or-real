Hot subdwarfs have been discovered pulsating within the globular cluster Omega Centauri (ω Cen). These stars exhibit characteristics similar to rapidly pulsing subdwarf B stars commonly found in the field, and were previously thought to belong to this class. However, spectroscopic analysis showed that these ω Cen stars are significantly hotter than anticipated, indicating a new class of hot subdwarfs that pulsate at temperatures around 50,000 K, which haven't been observed before in the field. This suggests the mechanism driving their pulsations resembles the iron opacity mechanisms found in rapidly pulsing subdwarf B stars.  The formation and evolution of hot subdwarf B- and O-type stars (sdB and sdO) stars is a topic of ongoing research in stellar evolution theory. While cooler sdB stars (temperature around 20,000–40,000 K) are known to be extremely compact and evolve towards the red giant branch (RGB) after shedding much of their hydrogen envelope near its end, the details of how they evolve, particularly their significant mass loss, remain unclear. Hotter sdO stars (temperature around 40,000–80,000 K), are even more challenging to understand and may involve a mix of post-EHB, post-RGB, and post-AGB stars. One promising method for studying different evolutionary scenarios is by inferring properties such as total stellar mass or remaining hydrogen envelope thickness from asteroseismological analysis of pulsating hot subdwarfs. This has been successful for rapidly pulsing subdwarf B (sdBVr) stars, which are a well-studied class of pulsators found in a narrow region around 29,000–36,000 K characterized by multi-periodic luminosity variations on a short timescale of 100–200 s. These pulsations can be explained by non-radial pressure mode instabilities driven by an opacity mechanism associated with iron overabundance in the driving region. While hot subdwarfs are prevalent within both Galactic field population and globular clusters (known as EHB or blue hook stars), their pulsation has primarily been studied using field star data until recently when they were discovered in a globular cluster for the first time.
