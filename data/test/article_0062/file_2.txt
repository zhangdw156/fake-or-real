The four main parts that make up the "4 MOST" project involve developing its instruments ("Instrument"), managing its operations ("Operations"), conducting scientific research using it ("Science"), and coordinating these activities together as a whole ("Facility").
Instrument: This involves building physical components like telescopes alongside software programs necessary to operate them effectively (like "hardware" "software"). This work happens through collaboration among various institutions that form part of this project called "The 'Facility' ".
Operations: This focuses on how observations happen - from planning them through data storagesharing with publications - essentially everything related to getting results from those observations . A group specifically dedicated to this task called "Operations Development Group" oversees it with support from specialized teams within their organization who focus on specific components like scheduling or technical support during observation sessions .
Science: Here's where scientists come in! They develop specific research plans known as surveys which cover topics ranging from galactic objects to distant galaxies across space.. These researchers then lead smaller teams known as Survey Teams which conduct their own investigations under their respective Survey Principal Investigators(PIs) overseeing each surveys progress . A board made up entirely of these PIs ensures communication between various scientific projects within Science.
This complex structure ensures smooth operation while allowing scientists freedom in their research endeavors while maintaining quality control throughout every step involving this groundbreaking astronomical observatory!
