The four main parts making up this project - Instrument Development Operation - and Science Research - work together to make it successful:
1. Instrument: This part focuses on building physical tools like cameras (magic boxes) needed to gather scientific data using telescopes like magic wands! They're built across various research institutions with help from folks who run this whole show – their headquarters in Germany! When everything's ready they get sent off to Chile where theyll be used on powerful telescopes like those at Paranal Observatory!
2. Operation: This group plans how we collect magic wand photos from near space then organizes how we store them safely so future researchers can use them later on! They also help manage communication between everyone involved with observing things in space! You could think about this as an organized filing system that tracks every picture taken with these amazing instruments!.
3. Science: This part involves creating special "recipes" or "surveys" that tell us what kind of information we want from our magic wands—like recipes telling us what ingredients make delicious food—and then putting together those recipes into experiments designed around these detailed instructions..
