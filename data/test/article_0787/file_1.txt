We recently acquired an impressive data set for a large star-forming galaxy at a redshift of z = 2.38, which was published in the August 17 issue of Nature. The galaxy, named BzK-15504, was chosen based on the 'star-forming BzK' color criteria during a wide-field optical and near-infrared imaging survey. We had the advantage of having a suitable adaptive optics (AO) star nearby and excellent atmospheric conditions during the SINFONI observations. This allowed for a deep integration of 6 hours on the source, achieving a spatial resolution of about 0.15 arcseconds, or 1.2 kiloparsecs at the galaxy's redshift. This offers the most detailed view of the Hα morphology and kinematics for a system at z ~ 2 so far. The Hα emission of BzK-15504 shares many features with some of our BM/BX objects, but with three times better spatial resolution, and there are notable differences as well. The morphology is clumpy, embedded in a more diffuse, low-surface brightness component that extends over nearly 2 arcminutes (16 kiloparsecs), but it is generally symmetric along the major axis and centralized on the peak continuum. In the outer regions, the velocity field appears smooth, and the rotation curve levels off at distances of about 8–10 kiloparsecs, providing strong evidence for a rotating disk. In the inner few kiloparsecs, the twist in the isovelocity contours compared to the larger pattern indicates radial flows that may be connected to material inflow toward the center, or an outflow potentially driven by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in this galaxy. However, the AGN does not clearly dominate the overall Hα line emission and kinematics, and there are no obvious indications of a major merger. BzK-15504 seems to be a large, massive, gas-rich clumpy disk that may be in the process of channeling gas toward a central growing bulge and fueling an AGN.
