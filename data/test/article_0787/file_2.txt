We recently acquired impressive data on a large star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 2.38, published in the 17 August issue of Nature. This galaxy, called BzK-15504, was chosen using the ‘star-forming BzK’ color criteria during a broad optical and near-infrared imaging study. We had the benefit of an appropriate adaptive optics star nearby the source along with good atmospheric conditions while conducting SINFONI observations. This allowed for an extensive 6-hour observation period with a spatial resolution of approximately 0.15", or 1.2 kiloparsecs at the galaxy's redshift. This provides the most detailed insight into the Ha morphology and kinematics of a galaxy at z ~ 2 to date. The Ha emission of BzK-15504 shares many features with some of our BM/BX objects but is captured with three times better spatial resolution, and there are notable differences as well. The structure is clumpy and surrounded by a more diffuse, low-surface brightness area that spans nearly 2” (16 kpc), and it is mainly symmetrical along the major axis and aligned with the continuum peak. In the outer regions, the velocity outlines appear smooth, and the rotation curve levels out between 8 and 10 kpc, providing strong evidence for a rotating disk. Meanwhile, in the innermost few kiloparsecs, the deformation of the isovelocity lines in comparison to the larger trend implies radial movements which could indicate gas inflows toward the center, and/or outflows possibly linked to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) present in this galaxy. However, the AGN is clearly not the primary source of the overall Ha line emission and dynamics. No significant evidence of a major merger was found. BzK-15504 seems to be a large, massive, gas-rich, clumpy disk that may be actively directing gas towards a growing central bulge that fuels an AGN.
