**Searching for the First Galaxies through Gravitational Lenses**  
Studying the first galaxies that formed during the reionisation period, roughly within the first billion years after the Big Bang, is a significant challenge in modern astrophysics. Various efforts are underway to locate these distant objects. By combining near-infrared imaging from the VLT with the natural phenomenon of strong gravitational lensing, our initial program has enabled us to identify several galaxy candidates with redshifts between 6 and 10. We analyze the characteristics of these objects and the implications for star formation rates at high redshifts. We also provide an update on follow-up observations and future plans. Like explorers of ancient oceans and lands, astronomers use their telescopes to expand our understanding of the Universe, uncovering the history of stars and galaxies since their inception. Not long ago, the most distant known galaxy was a faint object named HCM 6A with a redshift of 6.56, discovered through the gravitational lensing effects of a foreground galaxy cluster that amplified its light. A few quasars at similar distances have also been found, extending our observational reach back to less than one billion years after the Big Bang, nearing the end of cosmic reionisation. However, data from measurements of cosmic microwave background polarization and other evidence suggest that star formation in galaxies likely began even earlier. Since the early 1990s, the Lyman break or 'dropout' technique has emerged as an effective way to identify distant galaxies using broadband photometry. Additionally, the availability of sensitive infrared instruments on large ground-based telescopes has made it possible to detect protogalaxies at even higher redshifts. In light of these advancements, we initiated a pilot project a few years ago aimed at finding star-forming galaxies at redshifts exceeding 6â€“6.5, utilizing lensing clusters as gravitational telescopes, a method currently well-established. This project primarily relies on data from ISAAC and FORS, along with additional observations from CFHT and HST.
