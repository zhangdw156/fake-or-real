Now that we have measured star velocities out to the expected tidal radii in most dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), the next important step is to collect larger samples of stars at even greater distances. While progress has been made, the findings remain debated, and more extensive data sets are necessary. The main challenges include the vast areas of sky that need to be surveyed and selecting targets in regions where the number of dSph members is very low. Nevertheless, stars in these areas can provide valuable insights about dSph haloes. We believe all dSphs are influenced by the gravitational field of the Milky Way, but so far, we lack clear evidence of this interaction in any dSph. Determining the radii at which the Milky Way starts to affect dSphs will help us calculate the current total mass and size of their dark haloes. Additionally, to understand the properties of dark matter, we need to identify common characteristics across all dSphs; thus, we must conduct similar studies on all of them. Lastly, in the realm of dynamical modeling, finding relationships between the motions and chemical abundances of stars in dSphs could yield vital new information about their formation and evolution, which would also refine models of any astrophysical impact on their dark matter.
