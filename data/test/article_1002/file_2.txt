Now that we have measured star velocities out to the expected tidal radii in most dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), the next important step is to collect larger samples of stars at even greater distances. While progress has been made, the findings remain debated, and more extensive data sets are necessary. The main challenges are the vast areas of sky that need to be surveyed and selecting targets in regions where dSph members are sparse. Nevertheless, stars located in these areas can offer valuable insights into dSph haloes. It is anticipated that all dSphs should be influenced by the gravitational field of the Milky Way, but so far, we lack conclusive evidence of this in any dSph. Determining the radii at which the Milky Way affects dSphs will help calculate the current total mass and size of their dark haloes. Identifying the fundamental characteristics of dark matter also requires uncovering common traits among the dSphs, which means we need to conduct similar studies across all dSphs. Lastly, in the realm of dynamic modelling, finding connections between the motion and chemical composition of stars in dSphs could yield new insights into their formation and evolution, further refining astrophysical models related to dark matter.
