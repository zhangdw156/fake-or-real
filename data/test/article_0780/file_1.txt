Enhancing VIMOS MOS Observation Multiplexing for Future Spectroscopic Surveys

Astronomers trying to minimize the negative impact of fringing on VIMOS spectra have had to adopt observing methods that greatly restrict the multiplexing ability of VIMOS during multi-object spectroscopy. This paper introduces a new observing approach that, along with a new data reduction technique, could potentially double the multiplexing capacity of VIMOS while still producing spectra of quality similar to those achieved in previous major surveys. Modern spectroscopic surveys typically rely on multi-object observations, where many dozens to hundreds of objects are observed at once with each telescope pointing, enabling quicker completion of projects that obtain spectra from thousands of objects. However, achieving such a high level of multiplexing often conflicts with the requirements for obtaining high-quality spectra for each object observed. This paper outlines a new observing strategy and a tailored data reduction method for the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph (VIMOS), aimed at boosting the multiplexing of MOS observations without significantly compromising the quality of the resulting spectra. In the ideal scenario of a deep survey with numerous potential targets, this new strategy could allow for a doubling of multiplexing in VIMOS MOS observations.
