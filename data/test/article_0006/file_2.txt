The way information flows through 4MOST follows established practices used in astronomy, particularly within ESO's projects or large-scale surveys:
1.Target Catalogues: Surveys create catalogs containing relevant information about targets (e g., quality indicators). These catalogs are submitted for processing via an operations system..
2.Observation Block Creation: The operations system then combines these catalogs into "observation blocks" which are sent out for execution..
3.Telescope Operation: ESO executes these observation blocks using their telescopes, including VISTA's visible and infrared observations..
4.Data Acquisition: Raw telescope recordings are transferred into a dedicated storage system for further processing..
5.Data Reduction Analysis: A series of automated pipelines reduce this raw information into calibrated spectra before being passed on for deeper analysis..
6.Preservation Sharing: All processed results eventually end up in archives ready for scientific use both within research groups as well as global communities .
