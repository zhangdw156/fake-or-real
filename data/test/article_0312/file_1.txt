MLLoader's aim was to study how hot gas around our sun works by measuring its structure's polarization using an upcoming total sunblock event called "PACA_SolPol19." This involved several teams across multiple locations working together on equipment that could see into our sun's atmosphere more clearly than usual due it being very thin when viewed normally because it extends far out past where we can usually see things like planets or constellations within our own galaxy! This research aimed specifically for better understanding how energy gets transferred within this layer surrounding our star - something scientists are still trying figure out today!
