The Pro-Am Collaborative Astronomy project (PACA_SolPol19) observed how polarized light from our sun's outer atmosphere changes dramatically when it's hidden behind Earth's shadow during an eclipse called a "total" eclipse . This project focused on understanding how intensely hot parts called "coronal loops" heat up within our suns atmosphere due its complex interaction between magnetic fields electrons that generate this phenomenon..
To study these phenomena researchers took advantage of unique conditions offered by total eclipses where we can see directly through our planets atmosphere blocking most sunlight leaving only specific details visible . They combined their expertise using specialized telescopes equipped for both regular photography as well as measuring polarization which helps them understand what makes up those loops like their shape , movement density .
Their findings helped visualize features like equatorial "streamers" associated with less active periods on our sun , reveal variations in intensity across different locations within coronal loops ,and even captured images showing details about prominences - large structures that extend outwards from suns surface â€“ helping us understand more about these fascinating components!
