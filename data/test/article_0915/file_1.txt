There are over 10 different types of molecules found in the interstellar medium, with about 10% of them being positively charged ions. Most of these molecules include hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, which are the four most common elements. A few molecules that contain silicon, sulfur, phosphorus, and even one with iron have also been identified. Until now, only two molecules with halogens, HCl and HF, were known to exist in the interstellar medium. Unfortunately, HF, which is the main source of fluorine in space, cannot be observed from ground-based telescopes but was detected by the Infrared Space Observatory in a study led by David Neufeld, which included APEX project scientist Peter Schilke. Neufeld and his team recently investigated fluorine chemistry in more detail and predicted that CF+ would be the second most common fluorine-containing molecule. The surface smoothness is measured at 14.7 Âµm rms. In collaboration with the IRAM 30-m telescope, APEX has successfully identified CF+ (fluoromethylidynium) in space for the first time. The IRAM telescope detected its two lowest energy spectral lines, while APEX confirmed the identification with a third line. This molecule is found in a region where ultraviolet light from hot stars, which also excite the famous Orion Nebula, provides ionizing radiation. Our findings suggest that the models of fluorine-containing molecules' chemistry are accurate, and these molecules can be used to study interstellar clouds, marking a new development in interstellar chemistry.
