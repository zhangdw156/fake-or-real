With such an impressive turnout of young scientists and postdocs whose contributions were a beacon of brilliance in the poster sessions, the Scientific Organising Committee decided to hold a competition to crown the best posters. The Poster Prize Committee, comprised of esteemed overview speakers and fellow project scientists, bestowed three awards upon outstanding researchers: E. Akiyama for his analysis of SV data on the protoplanetary disc around HD 163296; R. Herrera-Camus for their work in calibrating line as a star formation tracer in the depths of the universe; and M. McCoy for his study on the Early Science absorption spectrum of the nearby active galactic nucleus of Cen-A. Each winner received an ALMA coffee mug, symbolizing the long hours to be spent deciphering the mysteries held within our ALMA data, as well as a copy of a book that inspires us with the awe and biological diversity found in the stunning landscape of Northern Chile where ALMA resides. 
Two other posters also made an impactful impression –  A. Avison’s work on the Observation Support Tool and H. Nagai's description of the status of ALMA polarisation observations received special commendation. The meticulous execution of this conference was largely due to the dedicated efforts of the JAO local organising committee. This event was proudly co-sponsored by ESO, NAOJ, NRAO, the EC-FP7 Radionet-3 project, and CONYCIT.
