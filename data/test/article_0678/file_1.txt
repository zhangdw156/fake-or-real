The Scientific Organising Committee held a poster competition for young researchers whose work garnered strong reviews during the poster sessions. A committee of experts awarded prizes to three students whose posters excelled in scientific merit: E. Akiyama for their analysis of protoplanetary disc data around a star, R. Herrera-Camus for developing methods to identify star formation sites across vast distances, and M. McCoy for exploring early science absorption spectra from an active galactic nucleus. Winners received an ALMA coffee mug and a book featuring the beauty and biological diversity of the northern Chile region where the ALMA Observatory is located. Two posters highlighting key technical advancements in ALMA also received special recognition: A. Avison's work on the Observation Support Tool and H. Nagai's description of the status of ALMA polarisation observations.  The conference was successfully organised by the JAO local organising committee, with co-sponsorship from ESO, NAOJ, NRAO, EC-FP7 Radionet-3 project and CONYCIT.
