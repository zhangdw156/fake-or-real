This research aimed to understand how star shapes differ from perfectly round ones using various techniques like examining visibility patterns across different directions and analyzing phase differences based on how starlight bends around an object's surface structure (like a sphere).
We found evidence for complex star shapes in some specific types (like those containing oxygen) by observing their light behavior differently than predicted by simple models for round or elliptical shapes (like those found in carbon stars). Our study suggests that asymmetry might be a characteristic feature associated with oxygen rich star systems compared to other types like carbon based ones where symmetry appears more common in their light behavior patterns .
