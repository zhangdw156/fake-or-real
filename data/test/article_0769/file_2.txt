The spectra are mostly very blue, which shows that there are young stars that are about 10 million to 100 million years old, in line with the UV color selection used. Figure 4 displays the combined rest-frame UV spectrum created by stacking 25 emission-line spectra from galaxies with redshifts between 5.1 and 6.2 (average redshift of 5.72 ± 0.26). The Lya emission line, along with the break and the flatness of the continuum just past the Lya line, is clearly visible. The rest-frame equivalent width of the Lya line is about 30 Å, similar to what has been measured for emission-line LBGs at a redshift of 3. The UV continuum is reduced before the Lya line due to intergalactic HI absorption. In one galaxy, the NIV]-1485 Å emission line is also observed, suggesting the presence of HII regions with very hot ionizing stars. It will be useful to compare the characteristics of our sample, based on Lyman-break selection, with surveys that choose Lyman-a emitters using narrow-band imaging. With many spectroscopically confirmed galaxies and the UV continuum data, we can estimate the overall star-formation rate of the Universe at z~ 6 (after accounting for dust extinction) and its role in the reionization of the Universe. Additionally, GOODS encompasses more. Utilizing VLT/ISAAC and Spitzer/IRAC observations that cover the electromagnetic spectrum from 1.2 to 8 microns, along with the current high-redshift sample, we can conduct an organized study of the stellar-mass content of galaxies at z~ 6 and examine formation processes from even earlier times. The current sample will also enable us to investigate large-scale structure and the clustering characteristics of galaxies from these early periods, providing insights into the typical masses of the dark matter halos they inhabit. Thus, GOODS is offering rigorous examinations of galaxy formation models.
