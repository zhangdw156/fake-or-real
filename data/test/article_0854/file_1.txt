Sixty-three percent of survey participants have published work using ESO data, and seventy-two percent of those used actual archival data, rather than data from their own research programs. This is a significant trend for a ground-based observatory. Other astronomical data centers have also noted that research utilizing archives is becoming increasingly important. However, the growing amount and diversity of data is adding more complexity for users of the ESO archive. To enhance the scientific value of the archive, the ESO VO Systems department is working on creating and sharing Advanced Data Products (ADPs), which are well-processed data ready for research use, such as the GOODS/ISAAC data release. Most ADPs will come from the astronomical community, such as the Garching-Bonn Deep Survey/WFI data release. Public Survey data from VISTA and OmegaCAM at the VLT Survey Telescope will also contribute to the archive. Furthermore, starting with Period 75, Principal Investigators of ESO Large Programs must submit their data products to the ESO archive when they publish their findings. The survey showed that one-third of archival research papers rely on high-level data products (ADPs, EIS, Science Verification, Commissioning data) instead of raw data. With over 3,000 raw data sets and around 100 high-level data sets in the ESO archive, the survey data in Figure 3 (top) were adjusted to better represent the scientific output from raw versus high-level data. Consequently, a high-level data set is about 15 times more likely to result in a scientific publication than a raw data set (Figure 3, bottom). Similar trends have been observed at other archive facilities, like HST. This further underscores the importance of ADPs in the ESO SAF and their potential to enhance scientific research.
