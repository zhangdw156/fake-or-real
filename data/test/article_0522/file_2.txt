Now that the DSM has been delivered, we're faced with a seemingly straightforward sequence of events. But do those tasks really hold up against scrutiny? The AOF project is at a critical juncture – most things are now in a sequential order.  Let's dissect January 2013, when the DSM was mounted on ASSIST. Arcetri Observatory and ESO, their presence vital here, will fully characterize the DSM optically. Four months to complete this task, still entrusted to the contractor's hands. ASSIST, with its monstrous 1.7-meter main mirror, holds a complete optical setup for the DSM – no simple feat! Using a fast interferometer, the DSM will be optically characterized first; but but is that really the only way?  For other tests with GRAAL and GALACSI, ASSIST simulates the constellation of sources with natural and laser guide stars. But, are these simulated conditions truly reliable enough for those rigorous tests, defocused and aberrated by calibrated turbulence. And, just how precise does this simulation need to be? The AO modules can be mounted on ASSIST; an output optical module replicates the VLT Nasmyth focus's interface – a necessary step in building a stable adaptive optics loop, but is it truly robust enough?  For that, we turn to the source module of ASSIST and its phase screens to generate calibrated turbulence. This will feed both the DSM and GRAAL. It feeds them all! The GRAAL real-time computer and wavefront sensor create realistic conditions for closed-loop operation. But, but is it truly realistic enough?  Will natural guide star mode on-axis of GRAAL be tested first. These tests serve as a strong foundation for advancing with GRAAL's GLAO correction mode, or is it not even necessary at this point in time? Then, we move onto GALACSI, and its GLAO correction mode. But can that really achieve the desired results?  Will it truly measure up to the demands of the task? The second correction mode for GALACSI (LTAOs for MUSE narrow-field) is next. Before being shipped out for testing on a new location, the DSM will be refurbished with the spare thin shell. The second shell in the DSM will then be fully qualified and validated on ASSIST. But, are these tasks reliable enough?  This first phase of the AOF commissioning period will likely run through 2015.
