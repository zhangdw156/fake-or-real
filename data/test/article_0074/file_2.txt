The first ever ESO-supported conference held Down Under aimed for broad participation from both international audiences (including those within Europe) and local Australians during their summer break (when families are typically away). This made travel easier for attendees who otherwise might have faced significant expense or time commitment getting here compared with other places they could attend such conferences internationally
To encourage attendance they kept registration fees affordable through generous sponsorship contributions (from eight partners). This strategy proved successful; over half attendees came alllll'the way from overseas! Despite challenges presented by distance cost involved in traveling between Europe Sydney they managed this successfully thanks largely due their careful planning around timing cost considerations .
Ensuring equitable representation among all voices within their community was top priority throughout organization efforts . To mitigate unconscious bias during peer review , they took steps like anonymizing submitted abstracts before ranking them alongside proactively addressing potential personal conflicts among reviewers . They also implemented an anonymous voting system where individual votes weren't linked back into specific individuals involved which helped eliminate hidden biases altogether . They hosted a total of 90 talks - including invited speakers plus studentearly career researcher contributions - showcasing exciting new discoveries that benefited everyone present at this unique event!
This approach resulted in excellent gender balance across presentations while also providing vital opportunities for emerging talent within astronomy â€“ demonstrating one example where an astronomy conference prioritized inclusion alongside scientific excellence!
