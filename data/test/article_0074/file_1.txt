This first ESO-backed conference held in Australia aimed for inclusivity by attracting both local attendees (Australian) and those internationally interested (ESO). Strategic timing during summer break (in Australia) aligned well with winter breaks across much of Europe making travel less costly for international attendees while keeping registration fees affordable thanks largely due to eight sponsorships . This strategy resulted in over half attendees coming from overseas despite travel being costly! Organizers took special care throughout planning ensuring diverse participation through measures like: anonymizing submitted papers before ranking them; requiring reviewers disclose potential conflicts; ensuring anonymity for voting processes â€“ all designed specifically against unconscious bias impacting results . The event featured a robust program comprising 26 invited talks 73 contributed talks plus posters covering diverse topics ranging widely into astronomy research - all reflecting high quality scientific discourse showcasing diversity within its ranks.. Notably , anonymous voting led towards excellent gender balance among speakers while highlighting future scientists' contributions - offering one exemplary model for representation efforts within Astronomy conferences focused on improving inclusivity among women early career researchers.. The blend created a dynamic environment enriching scientific exchange through new perspectives offered by diverse voices!
