This is a short report on a feasibility study for automatically extracting high-quality spectra from FORS2-MXU data using the aXe package, designed for slitless spectroscopy. We outline the aXe data reduction approach, typically used with HST-ACS data, and show its effectiveness by processing a sample from the Great Observatories Origins Survey (GOODS) FORS2 spectroscopic survey. Modern multi-object spectrographs allow for many simultaneous observations, necessitating automatic data reduction software, which is commonly used in space astronomy. The aXe software generates high-quality spectra for the ACS instrument's slitless modes on HST, benefiting from the instrument's stability to create generic calibration files (like those for tracing, wavelength solutions, flat-fields, and sensitivity curves) for each dispersive element, eliminating the need for individual calibration for each set of observations. The data-reduction process is driven solely by object coordinates within the Field of View (FoV), allowing thousands of spectra to be extracted from long exposures, far beyond manual processing capabilities. The software has been effective in various ACS projects, such as the Hubble Ultra Deep Field HRC Parallels, high redshift supernovae searches, and the Grism ACS Program for Extragalactic Science. It stores instrument-specific parameters in flexible external configuration files, making it adaptable to new instruments, including multi-slit spectrographs like FORS2 at the VLT. Since there is currently no available software for FORS2-MXU mode reduction, we undertook this feasibility study to explore automatic spectral extraction with aXe.
