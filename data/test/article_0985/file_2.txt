The design of the SPHERE Adaptive optics for eXoplanet Observation (SAXO), created through a careful balance of optical design, technology, costs, and risks, uses a 41 × 41 actuator deformable mirror (DM) that has a diameter of 180 mm. This DM's inter-actuator motion exceeds ±1 μm, and its maximum stroke goes beyond ±3.5 μm. Additionally, there is a two-axis tip-tilt mirror (TTM) with a resolution of ± 0.5 milliarcseconds (mas). The wavefront sensor is a 40 × 40 lenslet Shack-Hartmann sensor operating within a spectral range of 0.45 to 0.95 micrometers and features a focal plane filter that varies in size (from l/d to 3l/d at 0.7 μm, where d is the diameter of the microlens) to control aliasing. Temporal sampling is done at a frequency of 1.2 kHz using a 240 × 240 pixel Electron Multiplying CCD detector (CCD220 from EEV), which has a read-out noise of less than 1 electron and a 1.4 excess photon noise factor. The total adaptive optics system delay is kept under 1 millisecond. Stability of images and pupils is crucial for high-contrast instruments. Consequently, movements of differential images due to thermal and mechanical effects, along with the precision of the ADC system, are monitored in real-time through a Near-Infrared (NIR) tip-tilt sensor positioned near the coronagraph focus, with corrections made using a differential tip-tilt mirror in the wavefront sensing (WFS) arm. Pupil irregularities are tracked by examining the intensity of a segment along the pupil's edge and are adjusted by a pupil tip-tilt mirror located near the telescope's focal plane in the instrument's entrance. Non-common path aberrations are measured separately using a phase diversity algorithm and corrected on-the-fly by adjusting reference slopes.
