The SPHERE Adaptive optics for eXoplanet Observation (SAXO) system is designed through a careful balance of optical design, technology, cost, and risk, resulting in a 41 × 41 actuator deformable mirror (DM) that has a diameter of 180 mm, with inter-actuator strokes greater than ±1 μm and maximum strokes over ±3.5 μm. It also includes a two-axis tip-tilt mirror (TTM) with a resolution of ±0.5 mas. The wavefront sensor is a 40 × 40 lenslet Shack-Hartmann sensor that operates within a spectral range of 0.45 to 0.95 μm and features a variable size focal plane filter (from l/d to 3l/d at 0.7 μm, where d is the microlens diameter) for aliasing control. A temporal sampling frequency of 1.2 kHz is achieved with a 240 × 240 pixel electron multiplying CCD detector (CCD220 from EEV), which has a read-out noise of less than 1 electron and a 1.4 excess photon noise factor. The global adaptive optics (AO) loop delay is kept under 1 ms. For high-contrast instruments, it is crucial to maintain image and pupil stability. Therefore, differential image movements from thermo-mechanical effects and the precision of the ADC mechanism are monitored in real time using an auxiliary near-infrared (NIR) tip-tilt sensor positioned near the coronagraphic focus, with corrections applied through a differential tip-tilt mirror in the wavefront sensor (WFS) section. Additionally, pupil run-out is assessed by analyzing the WFS sub-pupil intensity at the pupil edge and adjusted by a pupil tip-tilt mirror near the telescope focal plane at the instrument's entrance. Non-common path aberrations are measured off-line using a phase diversity algorithm and corrected online through reference slope adjustments.
