We provide two examples demonstrating the benefits of using VirGO compared to the archive query form. In the first case, a user creating an observing proposal in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) wants to find all available ESO observations within one square degree of this field. With the primary ESO archive query form, the user would wait about 28 minutes for the results to appear as an HTML table. In contrast, using VirGO, the same query takes only four minutes and displays the results visually, allowing the user to immediately assess overlaps between observations, understand the depth of exposure with the footprint blending option, or selectively review reduced data. In the second example, a user looking to identify targets that ESO/GOODS has followed spectroscopically in the CDF-S would receive an HTML list of relevant files if using the Advanced Data Products query form. However, a similar query in VirGO would yield a visualization of the reduced spectra available. The user could then choose an image as a background to determine source positions or, by zooming in, examine the slit orientation (when accessible) and the number of spectra per object used in the final product, or view individual spectra using additional VO tools prior to requesting them from the archive.
