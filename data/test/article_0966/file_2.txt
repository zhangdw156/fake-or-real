We provide two examples demonstrating the benefits of using VirGO compared to the archive query form. A user preparing an observing proposal in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) wants to find all available ESO observations in a one square degree area of this field. With the main ESO archive query form, the user must wait approximately 28 minutes for the results to be displayed as an HTML table. In contrast, using VirGO, the same query takes only four minutes and presents the results visually, enabling the user to immediately see overlaps between observations, understand the depth of exposures (with the footprint blending option), or selectively view reduced data. Another user seeks information on targets that ESO/GOODS has spectroscopically followed up in the CDF-S. The Advanced Data Products query form would again generate an HTML list of relevant files. Using VirGO for the same query produces a visualization of the available reduced spectra. The user can select an image as a background for source identification, zoom in to examine the orientation of the slit (if available), check the number of spectra per object, or even visualize individual spectra with other VO tools before requesting them from the archive.
