warship researchers found evidence that starlight is fueling new stars within many galaxy clusters called "TIMER galaxies." By studying these light emissions they can understand how much material is being drawn into these centers through interactions with nearby stars or through other forces like gravity or magnetic fields at work within them . Some researchers discovered that some areas within these galaxies show signs consistent with active galactic nuclei , which suggests intense energy release near their central point . This research helps us understand how different types of matter interact within these massive systems over long periods .
