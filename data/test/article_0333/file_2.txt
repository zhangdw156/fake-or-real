Observations reveal that many TIMER galaxies show signs of ionized gases within them using specific light emissions from these gases that help us understand what drives this ionization process within interstellar space itself - including things like electron density temperature along with metal content within those spaces.. While some galaxies have ionized gases solely driven by star formation at their centers most display similar ionization patterns found near low-ionization nuclear emission line regions (LINERs). Two others exhibit characteristics typical for broad line type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN) . These observations also allow us to study how fast these ions move through these spaces due to various factors beyond just gravity impacting their movement patterns. This data helps us analyze how fast moving elements enter into a galaxy's bar where they collide with each other losing angular momentum through shockwaves.. One example analyzed highlights how astronomers can map out velocities based on both stellar movements as well as ionized gases themselves revealing an influx into an area near a galaxy's nucleus fueled by star forming activity .
