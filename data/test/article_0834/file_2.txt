ESO’s Studentship Programs: Preparing Future Astronomers Today  
Students are essential to astronomy, representing its next generation. While enrollments in other scientific fields are declining, the ASTRONET strategic plan for European Astronomy states that “young students have continued to enter the field at a steady level.” With the Very Large Telescope (VLT), Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), and other exciting facilities in development, it is an ideal time to be an astronomy student. ESO plays a key role in shaping the future of astronomy, and one significant way to do this is by offering both short-term and long-term studentships that provide students with outstanding research opportunities under the guidance of ESO astronomers. Over the past twenty years, hundreds of young astronomers have completed part of their PhD programs at ESO in Garching or Santiago, many of whom have progressed to prominent roles in universities, observatories, and other organizations across Europe and beyond.
