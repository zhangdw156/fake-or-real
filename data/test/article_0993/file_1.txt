A short burst typically lasts about 0.2 seconds. These bursts are more intense in their spectrum than long bursts and account for approximately 30% of the BATSE sample and 10% of the Swift sample. The Swift spacecraft quickly detected the X-ray emissions from the short gamma-ray burst (GRB) 050509, allowing precise localization of the event to identify its likely host galaxy, an elliptical galaxy at redshift z = 0.22. High-quality images were captured using the VLT, Subaru, HST, and other telescopes. Two months later, HETE-II detected GRB 050709, and ESO telescopes found its optical counterpart and observed its host galaxy at a redshift of z = 0.16. About two weeks after that, Swift detected and studied GRB 050724, along with several other short GRBs in subsequent months. After extensive investigation, the counterparts for short GRBs were finally identified. These observations indicated that the host galaxies of short GRBs are generally early-type galaxies, like that of GRB 050509B, or contain a relatively old stellar population, as seen with GRB 050709. This contrasts sharply with long GRBs, which are typically linked to dwarf galaxies with active star formation. The lower redshift of these short GRBs suggests their energy output is about 100 to 1000 times smaller than that of long bursts. Many short GRBs with well-defined positions so far have not revealed any optical afterglow, and in some cases, even soft X-ray emissions were not detected. Ongoing rapid-response observations with ground-based telescopes are crucial to determine if short GRBs include different subclasses. However, both short and long bursts appear to fit within the same general model, where a newly formed black hole-torus system generates the GRB, even though the pathways of massive star evolution leading to each vary significantly. It is worth mentioning that there are important alternative theories. In Usovâ€™s model, the relativistic flow is primarily Poynting flux, driven by the magnetic and rotational energies of a rapidly rotating neutron star.
