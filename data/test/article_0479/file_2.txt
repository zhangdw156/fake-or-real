While lacking the sharp details of Hubble Space Telescope images, the MUSE Orion dataset can still analyze small-scale structures in the Orion Nebula, like HH objects and proplyds. Figure 5 shows a comparison of two Orion proplyds observed by both HST and MUSE to demonstrate the difference in their resolution. This analysis focuses on two emission line ratios: S23 ([S II] + [S III])/HÎ², and [O II]/[O III], which indicate ionisation levels.  Figure 6 shows a diagram of the parameter space for these ratios, highlighting how different objects occupy distinct regions in this space. This diagram can be used to identify similar structures in other star-forming regions. For example, the Bright Bar has higher S23 values than proplyds and HH objects while showing wider variation in ionisation levels. Additionally, HH outflows and proplyds are classified into four groups based on their S23 and [O II]/[O III] ratios. Based on these observations, an early hypothesis suggests that the S23 parameter reflects the influence of shocks and photo-ionisation in sulfur excitation. The presence of shock waves locally reduces ionization levels and increases the emission of lower ionisation species relative to higher ones. A more detailed explanation will be presented in Mc Leod et al.
