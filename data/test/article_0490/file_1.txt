The measurement of black hole mass in Cen A has improved significantly over the last eight years due to advancements in observation techniques, particularly in near-infrared astronomy. High spatial resolution is crucial for understanding how the central black hole affects gas and star movement. Adaptive optics, which allows telescopes to overcome atmospheric disturbances, has been successfully employed with near-infrared adaptive optics spectrographs like NACO on the VLT telescope, enabling observations of even dusty galaxy nuclei at a very detailed level (0.1 arcseconds).  This high resolution is further enhanced when combined with integral field spectroscopy techniques such as SINFONI, allowing for the mapping of gas and stars in three dimensions. This enables direct comparison of the morphology and kinematics of different gas types and star populations. Using this tool, the influence of the inner jet on the motion of ionized gas in Cen A can be investigated. Furthermore, molecular hydrogen has been identified as a reliable tracer of the central gravitational potential. Due to the impact of the physical state of the gas being utilized as a tracer for dynamic models, the black hole mass measurement has decreased from study to study due to an increase in spatial resolution and changes in the kinematic tracer. The presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) can significantly affect gas kinematics, while stellar kinematics should remain unaffected by this influence. However, extracting stellar kinematics from spectral absorption features becomes more challenging near the AGN due to the blurring effect caused by the AGN continuum, as it dilutes the stellar absorption lines. This difference in analysis techniques is a valuable lesson learned from Cen A and highlights the need for caution when extracting kinematic data from distant objects. Another key takeaway is that high residuals are present in the modeling of gas velocity, particularly beyond r ~ 1.7 arcseconds.  The main challenge here is not represented by the modeled disc inclination at these radii. This finding has no impact on the derived black hole mass. Reliable stellar kinematics extraction is possible with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio data, particularly for small radii. Cen A is the closest active galactic nucleus to us and a complex system, offering valuable opportunities to study further instrument advancements. Each step in the development of observing technologies will likely reveal even more intricate substructures in our understanding. It's important to maintain continuous attention on these observations and develop new models to interpret them accurately and understand their limitations.
