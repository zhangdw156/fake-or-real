Due to low transmission levels near SEPIA660's frequency limits during observation time constraints an excellent target was chosen - Orion KL - known for its bright features that can be seen even under limited exposure times thanks to its high density contrast against background light pollution making it ideal for monitoring instrument performance across various projects while providing crucial data points through cross calibration studies . Orion KL serves as close proximity observation site allowing scientists access into studying high mass star formation processes occurring within it - located just 415 parsecs from Earth , it serves as an important "cosmic laboratory" where researchers actively explore various aspects related to these formations . Previous research efforts using multiple instruments like Chandra X Ray telescope , Keck Mid Infrared Telescope , SofI Near Infrared Telescope Karl G Jansky Very Large Array have provided detailed information about various features within these areas including embedded young stars whose properties allow us insight into their development over time . One notable feature discovered within these studies was Source I , characterized by unusual SiO maser emissions among other young stellar objects studied previously . The location of Source I along with SMA1 other similar structures will provide valuable clues about their evolution over time due their distinct characteristics such as morphology movement patterns . This work focuses on exploring specific details around Source I using SEPIA's capabilities focusing on locations surrounding them including potential molecular outflows originating from complex inner regions where intense activity occurs alongside studying individual components such as hot cores newly formed structures situated nearby allowing researchers access into understanding how they interact dynamically over long periods
