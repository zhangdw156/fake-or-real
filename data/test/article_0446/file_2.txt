At the heart of this groundbreaking workshop lay a shared vision: fostering long-term funding for the unsung heroes – physicists and chemists – powering ALMA's data revolution.  We agreed that their contributions, vital to unlocking the secrets of the cosmos, deserve dedicated attention and support.

**Imagine the possibilities!**: Our White Paper will shine a spotlight on this crucial work, emphasizing how it drives astronomical breakthroughs in millimetre and submillimeter observations. We need to leverage this powerful document to secure funding from those who can help us reach these ambitious goals.

But the story doesn't end there. Recent advancements in chemical network modeling, radiation transfer codes, and source structure analysis – all born from astronomical research – now require careful attention.  It’s not just about developing these tools; it's about making them accessible for a wider audience. Imagine web pages for ALMA Regional Centres! A central hub where researchers can easily find pre-written, readily available codes - an essential stepping stone in unlocking the universe's most profound mysteries.

**The power of collaboration**: The workshop was more than just a meeting – it brought together astronomers, physicists and chemists to share their expertise. This synergy resulted in actionable steps:  identification of needs for new data and models; definitions of how best to provide them. And we are already planning the next stage! Regular workshops will keep us on track, allowing us to monitor progress across all areas - from astronomical research to technological advancements – as well as explore the exciting possibilities arising from these groundbreaking experiments and computations. 


Let's embrace this future where cutting-edge space medicine pushes the boundaries of human understanding, fueled by shared knowledge and innovative tools.
