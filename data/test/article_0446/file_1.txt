The participants at the workshop agreed that it is important to support scientists who generate data for ALMA analysis. They will write a White Paper that explains why this work is so crucial for scientific output from the ALMA observatory. This document can be used when asking for funding support.  It's essential that researchers have proper credit and funding for developing advanced chemical network models, radiation transfer codes and source structure codes. The main issue is making these codes accessible and properly documented for others to use effectively. It was suggested that the ALMA Regional Centres establish web pages for this purpose. The workshop served as a valuable platform for discussions between astronomers, physicists, and chemists, helping identify needs and define actions to provide data and models. Participants agreed on holding regular workshops to track progress and developments in both astronomy and scientific advancements made through new experiments, computations, and catalogues.
