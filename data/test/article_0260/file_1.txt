Stereo techniques using two cameras enhance turbulence measurements compared to traditional methods by significantly boosting signal clarity while detecting weaker turbulent bands more effectively due to higher resolution vertical profiles available through this method . This leads to faster calculation speeds as well as improved accuracy in measuring wind speeds within these turbulent layers allowing real time calculations even when dealing with weak winds .
The Stereo SCIDAR system utilizes two key components:
1.) The Instrument: Situated at an AT coude focus it features specialized support structures connecting it with UROS equipment enabling precise tiptilt adjustments through mechanical interfaces while also offering shared focusing mechanisms controlled via controllers specific to both imaging planes along with optional derotation mechanisms also managed via controllers specific to those same imaging planes . It incorporates CCD detectors called Andor Luca S 658M EM CCDs cooled using Peltier technology which allows them not require any cooling liquids , plus an off axis camera aiding image acquisition tracking , all supported by local computers responsible for controlling its functions such as cameras data collection , rotation controls focusing functionalities .
2.) The Supervisor Workstation: Located within VLTI's computer room this workstation provides real time analysis display functionality through its supervisory software
The Optical Design itself relies on simplicity : only one powered component -a collimating lens - exists per arm ensuring that light reflection occurs after passing through prisms before reaching individual detectors positioned precisely on movable stages along their respective optical axes or slightly offset from them based upon effective observation plane conjugation under ideal conditions below telescope level.. An additional dichroic beam splitter ensures proper function within this design allowing access into another camera used directly during initial targeting procedures alongside guiding functions..
