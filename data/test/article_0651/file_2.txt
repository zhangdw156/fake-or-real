We compared data on the amount of water vapor (PWV) measured at Chajnantor and Paranal with a standard atmospheric model (GFS).  The agreement is good, and using a Kalman filter helps achieve excellent statistical agreement. The GFS forecast shows significant predictive power when compared to the simple "persistence" assumption. This forecast is particularly useful for ALMA and APEX telescopes as their performance relies heavily on atmospheric transparency.  It also helps with instrument cooling cycles, which reduces operational costs. 

For Paranal and VLT instruments, PWV is just one factor among many impacting science performance. To account for this complexity, more sophisticated models will be needed (meso-scale models). Work to develop such models at ESO is ongoing.  The GFS-based model has shown its worth in enabling operations at ESO observatories. PWV forecasts are now available for both Chajnantor and Paranal. We believe that forecasts of various atmospheric properties will become a standard tool for managing extremely large telescopes, ultimately improving scientific productivity.
