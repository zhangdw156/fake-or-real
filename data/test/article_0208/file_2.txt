enicg is an ongoing survey using data from NASA's Very Large Telescope that is designed to observe hundreds or thousands yet unidentified brown dwarfs within several different areas where new stars are forming—the kind you might find around some nebulae or other dense areas where there's lots going on."
The researchers used advanced tools available at this instrument called Star formation is being observed by taking pictures across multiple colors - some closeups showing details about individual components while others provide broader views – all done simultaneously on thousands upon thousands if not millions upon millions because it captures so many things star formation is happening everywhere! Then they carefully analyzed these images looking for signs that these newly formed or still forming young elements have just begun their lives as they take up matter from their parent bodies."
Their analysis showed them how much material these new stars were pulling into themselves - essentially how quickly they were growing - which was very useful because it helps scientists understand what kind they are becoming as time goes on...
