The ADHOC survey uses powerful telescopes like VLT's OmegaCAM to study young stars forming within various star clusters like Orion Nebula Cluster or Lupus. This study focuses on identifying these young stars by looking for extra light from their hydrogen lines ("H"). By measuring this "excess" light across multiple colors using deep images taken across a vast area around each cluster allows them to estimate things like how much material these young stars are consuming ("mass accretion rates"). This method is confirmed by comparing its findings with data from direct spectroscopy readings providing further proof that these newly identified "PMS" or pre main sequence stars truly fit our expectations for those stages. This project provides valuable insights into understanding how different types of star clusters form and evolve over time .
