The Sampo project has focused on creating a graphical user interface for processing ESO data reduction recipes. The main objectives of the project were detailed in a previous article. The key result of the Sampo project is an application called ESO Reflex (ESO REcipe FLexible EXecution workbench), where the sequence of reduction steps is shown and managed as a graphical workflow. This method enables users to easily follow and interact with the data reduction process without needing complex scripting. The ESO Reflex workflow is designed to be straightforward for users. For example, it includes a reduction sequence to create master calibrations for the FORS2 MXU mode. Input files are shown at the top of the workflow (light blue boxes), and the data moves through the workflow to produce final outputs at the bottom. The boxes between the inputs and outputs represent the processors that work on the data, while the arrows show the data flow from one processor to the next. ESO Reflex utilizes a graphical workflow engine called Taverna, which was initially developed for the e-Science community as part of the myGrid initiative in the United Kingdom. After evaluating other scientific workflow engines, the Sampo team customized Taverna to fit the needs of astronomical workflows. Enhancements include a new interface for launching workflows, support for FITS files, and connections to CPL, Python, and IDL. Users can easily edit and customize workflows in ESO Reflex by adding or removing processors and connecting the relevant input and output ports with arrows. The workflow engine manages the complexities of the data flow through the reduction workflow as defined visually by the user. This allows users to concentrate on their primary task: extracting scientific insights from their data. The ESO Reflex interface is not specific to any instrument, providing a consistent look and feel regardless of the data source.
