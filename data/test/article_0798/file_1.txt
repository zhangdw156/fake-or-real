The Sampo project has focused on creating a graphical interface to run automatic data reduction processes for ESO data. Its main objectives were outlined in a previous article. The key result of this project is ESO Reflex (ESO REcipe FLexible EXecution workbench), which allows the sequence of reduction steps to be displayed and managed as a graphical workflow. This setup enables users to easily understand and interact with the data reduction process without needing to write complicated scripts. The ESO Reflex workflow is designed to be user-friendly. This example illustrates a reduction sequence to create master calibrations for the FORS2 MXU mode. The input files are located at the top of the workflow (light blue boxes), and the data moves through the workflow to generate the final outputs at the bottom. The boxes between the inputs and outputs represent the data processing units, while the arrows indicate the flow of data from one unit to another. ESO Reflex uses a graphical workflow engine called Taverna, which was initially created for the e-Science community as part of the UK's myGrid initiative. After evaluating other scientific workflow engines, the Sampo team adopted and customized Taverna to fit astronomical workflows, adding features like a new workflow launcher, support for FITS files, and compatibility with CPL, Python, and IDL. Users can easily modify workflows in ESO Reflex by adding or removing processing boxes and linking the input and output ports with arrows. The underlying engine manages the complexities of data flow through the visually defined workflow, allowing users to focus on their main task of analyzing and maximizing the use of their data. The ESO Reflex interface is applicable to any instrument, providing a consistent user experience regardless of the data source.
