The Universidad de Concepción, the Centro de Astrofísica FONDAP, the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, and ESO are hosting a conference titled “Globular Clusters – Guides to Galaxies” from March 6–10, 2006. The main focus of the conference is to explore how globular clusters can enhance our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, which leads to various individual research questions. The aim of the conference is to gather both observational and theoretical researchers to share and discuss their latest findings. Topics will include the internal dynamics of globular clusters and their interactions with host galaxies, the accretion of globular clusters, detailed studies of nearby cluster systems, ultracompact dwarfs, the formation of massive clusters during mergers and in other contexts, the ACS Virgo survey, the relationship between galaxy formation and globular clusters, the dynamics and kinematics of globular-cluster systems, and issues related to dark matter.
