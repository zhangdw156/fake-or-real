The Universidad de Concepción, the Centro de Astrofísica FONDAP, the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, and ESO are hosting a conference titled “Globular Clusters – Guides to Galaxies” from March 6–10, 2006. The main focus of the conference is to explore how globular clusters can enhance our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, driving the larger investigation into globular-cluster systems. This encompasses many specific issues. Our aim is to gather researchers, both experimental and theoretical, to share and discuss recent findings. The conference will cover various topics including the internal dynamics of globular clusters and their interaction with galaxies, the accretion of clusters, detailed studies of local cluster systems, ultracompact dwarfs, the formation of massive clusters, results from the ACS Virgo survey, connections between galaxy formation and globular clusters, dynamics and kinematics within clusters, and issues related to dark matter.
