The WINGS cluster survey used data from over 6500 objects in clusters at a specific redshift range for analysis. This sample comes from the ROSAT X-ray-Brightest Abell-type Cluster Sample, and was supplemented with additional imaging data from J, K, and U-bands using the UKIRT and INT telescopes. The WINGS survey used multi-fiber instruments on various observatories to gather high-quality spectra for studying a range of cluster properties like aperture and surface photometry, stellar mass, star formation history of galaxies, cluster substructure, and dynamics. The data has been made publicly available through the Virtual Observatory. 

The main strength of this dataset is its comprehensive collection of low-redshift cluster data. However, one limitation is that it only covers the core region of each cluster. To gain a better understanding of the evolution of galaxies in clusters and their connections to surrounding areas, further study of the outer regions (including the transition zone between clusters and fields) would be needed. This exploration provides valuable insights into how galaxy environments change within these clusters and influences their transformations.
