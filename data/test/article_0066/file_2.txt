Three quasars with strong signs they're actively forming stars were found to have dusty regions around their centersâ€”a discovery made possible due to ALMA's high resolution imaging capabilities allowing detection even though much of this region emits nonthermal radiation like synchrotron radiation at radio wavelengths . These dusty regions suggest interactions between jets emanating from these quasars and surrounding gas clouds contributing significantly to extra energy output being released through powerful stellar formation processes driven by those jets within dense central areas - an indication for positive rather than negative feedback mechanisms within these active galactic nuclei(AGNs). While some evidence suggests wind flows originating from gas around them could indicate an alternative mechanism called "negative"feedback driven by ongoing host galaxy stellar activity like what has been observed locally around Messier 82 , further research into older or mature quasar sources may offer additional insights into potential mechanisms behind "negative"feedback related mechanisms involving black holes . Finally , this research confirms previous findings about compact dusty regions surrounding active galactic nuclei and provides further support for this being a common phenomenon leading towards galaxy growth regardless if it involves accretion onto supermassive black holes or not..
