In addition to the two projects mentioned, two more papers using GMASS spectra have been published. One study investigates the star metallicity of galaxies at around z ~ 2 by analyzing a combined spectrum of 75 star-forming galaxies, with a total observation time of 1653 hours. This is the first time the iron abundance and stellar metallicity have been measured at a median redshift of z = 1.88, with the metallicity constrained to log(Z/Z) = –0.57 ± 0.16. The second study examines the color differences in the galaxy population at very high redshifts and shows that the red sequence of passive galaxies lasts up to around z ~ 2 before it disappears. Additional papers are being prepared to cover survey strategies, resulting redshifts, morphological analyses, and the dust properties of galaxies up to z ~ 2.5. The GMASS spectra that have been published will be made accessible via the ESO GOODS website, creating a lasting resource for high-redshift galaxy research.
