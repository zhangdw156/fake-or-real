In addition to the two projects mentioned, two other papers using GMASS spectra have been published. One study investigates the stellar metallicity of galaxies at around z ~ 2 by analyzing a combined spectrum of 75 star-forming galaxies, with a total observation time of 1653 hours. This is the first time the iron abundance and stellar metallicity have been measured at a median redshift of z = 1.88, with the metallicity constrained to log(Z/Z) = –0.57 ± 0.16. The second study examines the color differences in the galaxy population at very high redshifts, finding that the red sequence of passive galaxies can be observed up to z ~ 2, after which it disappears. Several additional papers are being prepared that will discuss the survey strategy, resulting redshifts, morphological analysis, and dust properties of galaxies up to z ~ 2.5. The published GMASS spectra will be made available to the public through the ESO GOODS website, providing a lasting resource for research on high redshift galaxies.
