The four MOST telescope project aims at observing all southern hemisphere skies over five years using an innovative technique called "parallel observation." This approach allows scientists who wouldn't otherwise have access due its complexity or scope can participate with a dedicated "non participating" model where they receive specific allocated times for observations and manage their data independently through designated systems provided by ESO (European Southern Observatory). This system offers flexibility but requires independent data processing as it excludes participation within existing science collaborations established with other researchers within ESO's science team framework .
