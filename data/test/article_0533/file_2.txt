Most dust in galaxies forms during the final stages of low- and intermediate-mass star evolution. This dust is expelled into interstellar space (ISM) as stars reach their planetary nebula phase. Our observations reveal two main ways this dust leaves its parent star: a detached shell or an expanding torus. Recent studies have shown that these bipolar objects with equatorial tori are likely formed by interaction with a binary star companion. Studying the impact of a binary companion on dust formation from evolved stars is a new research area. To further understand the importance of planetary nebulae for dust production, it would be valuable to study how different ejection paths influence this process. Spatially resolved mid-infrared spectra of these sources will allow us to examine dust composition across different parts of the nebula. This can help us understand how dust evolves from its creation within the nebula to its ejection into space and the role a dense dust disc plays in this process.  Understanding mass loss during star evolution is critical for fields like stellar evolution and understanding how the interstellar medium is enriched by stars through what they leave behind.  An ongoing ESO program, which will combine MIDI, VISIR, and Herschel observations of a sample of evolved stars, aims to determine how this mass loss changes on different scales. The results will help us fully understand dust formation within a star's circumstellar envelope before it enters the interstellar medium, furthering our understanding of the life cycle of dust itself.
