ESO is seeking proposals from astronomers interested in conducting research using their new VISTA telescope's spectrograph (4MOST). These "Community Surveys," which will use up to one-third each year over five years, aim to expand our understanding beyond single target observations through large-scale studies involving many scientists and extensive data sharing efforts. These surveys contribute significantly to astronomical knowledge by providing valuable resources like archives where other researchers can build upon their findings, fostering further discoveries within astronomy itself thanks to these collaborative efforts supported by ESO as part its commitment to advancing research among its members (Public Surveys).
