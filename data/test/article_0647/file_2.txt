**Space Snake Strikes Again! E-ELT Ready for Construction Following Critical Milestone**

The European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) faced a crucial challenge: could it withstand the pressure and launch into construction?  Good news! The answer is a resounding YES! The telescope just cleared its final design review, a success story that has everyone buzzing. 

This top-tier assessment happened in September of 2010 at ESO Headquarters in Garching, with an impressive lineup of experts on board. 11 leading figures from all corners of astronomy were tasked with the ultimate question: is the E-ELT's design ready for the big time?  The answer was a resounding "Yes" from every panel member, marking a major leap forward in this exciting project.

This rigorous review demanded deep scrutiny on everything from the technical feasibility to the overall budget and construction timeline. For weeks, the Review Board dove into detail, scrutinizing all aspects of the E-ELT proposal. It was then, with a clear verdict after four days of intense evaluation, that they declared the E-ELT ready for its next phase—construction!

This exciting development has been further fueled by Brazil’s recent addition as a new member to ESO. This brings valuable expertise and resources into the fold at exactly the right time, amplifying their contributions to this groundbreaking project. 

With all the pieces in place and a firm green light for Council approval, the E-ELT will soon see its dreams take flight.  The "biggest eye on the sky" is set to debut by the end of this decade after securing a groundbreaking construction contract in 2012.  Just imagine the stories it'll uncover!
