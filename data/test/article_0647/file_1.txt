The European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) has completed a final review of its design. The review board was asked if the E-ELT's technical readiness makes it suitable to begin construction. They concluded that it is. This review took place from September 21st to 24th, 2010 at ESO Headquarters in Garching. It included eleven prominent members from different institutions and organizations: Steve Shectman (Carnegie/GMT), Chuck Claver (NOAO/LSST), Matt Johns (GMT), Doug MacMynowski (Caltech/TMT), Buddy Martin (Steward Observatory Mirror Lab), Harald Nicklas (University of Gottingen), Roberto Ragazzoni (INAF), Francois Rigaut (Gemini), Luc Simard (HIA/TMT), Doug Simons (Gemini), and Larry Stepp (TMT). The Board received a comprehensive proposal six weeks before the review, receiving 300+ questions and comments. They then held extensive discussions over four days regarding the design. The process resulted in positive feedback, constructive suggestions, and unanimous agreement that the E-ELT is ready for construction.  The review addressed technical points, as well as costs/contingency and schedule. A further study, a "Delta Phase B" study, will explore these topics more deeply. Meanwhile, Brazil has become ESO's 15th member state, bringing expertise to support the project. All necessary steps are in place for Council approval this year, which will allow them to break ground at Cerro Armazones in 2012, and ultimately see the E-ELT reach its first light by the end of the current decade.
