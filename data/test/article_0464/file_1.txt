The European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (ESO VLT) Adaptive Optics Facility (AOF) is modifying one of its telescopes (UT) to incorporate a new secondary mirror unit. This unit includes an adaptive secondary mirror, four laser guide stars formed by sodium beacons on the telescope's centerpiece and a dedicated adaptive optics (AO) instrument park for optimized AO correction modes. The AO components, GALACSI and GRAAL, are specifically designed:  GALACSI is an AO module for MUSE that provides ground layer adaptive optics (GLAO) correction and laser tomography correction for MUSE in its narrow-field mode, achieving high Strehl ratio correction in the visible spectral range. GRAAL is an AO module for HAWK-I, providing only ground layer adaptive optics correction. The Adaptive Secondary Simulator and Instrument Testbed (ASSIST) will be used for testing the AOF's upgrades in Europe.  
 
**Here are specific details of these components:**

* **GALACSI**:  mounted at the Nasmyth focus, it contains wavefront sensors (WFS), a natural star tilt sensor, and an infrared low-order sensor.  It has two field of views: a 1-arcminute view for GLAO correction, increasing ensquared energy at 750 nm by two, and a 7.5-arcsecond view for laser tomography correction that provides high Strehl ratio in the visible (5% at 650nm) on-axis.
* **GRAAL**: similar to GALACSI but only applies GLAO correction to improve ensquared energy in the K-band by a factor of two over the 7.5-arcminute field of view of HAWK-I. Its WFS are mounted on a rotating bearing inside the HAWK-I housing, while a natural guide star tilt sensor picks up a star in a ring outside the HAWK-I field of view.
* **Both components**: share identical SPARTA hardware architecture and many software features; this is a standard platform for real-time applications developed by ESOâ€™s Adaptive Optics Department that offers flexibility in its control and post-processing features while accommodating various WFS configurations. 


All WFS cameras and tilt sensor cameras use the e2v CCD220 devices controlled by the New General Controller developed by ESO's Optical Detector Team. This controller ensures a seamless workflow for these components.
