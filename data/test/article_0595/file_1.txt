Planning the construction and testing of VIMOS, an intricate astronomical instrument, requires careful consideration. The instrument's complexity is amplified by several factors including the advanced Adaptive Focus Camera (AFC) system.  Focus accuracy is crucial as even slight defocus can shift the locations of detected points on a photoreceptor array.   VIMOS's pixel coordinates are now linked to its AFC reference point, leading to adjustments in how images are processed and requiring the re-determination of the mapping between pixels and CCDs. 

To ensure accurate alignments, VIMOS utilizes three reference systems: the detector's location in pixels, the focal plane's location in millimeters, and the direction of spectral dispersion. The latter needs precise alignment for observations using multiplexed instruments with low resolution gratings, as the filtering process relies on the accuracy of spectral orders.

Given the instrumentâ€™s complex configuration, all six grisms per arm (totaling 4 arms) must be re-aligned, resulting in a significant effort to ensure they meet their intended function. Instrument recalibration following any adjustments made to the focal plane image requires at least one week.  This process, which was part of the commissioning phase and served to become familiar with the instrument's new hardware, had to be repeated several times. 

Despite this, the recharacterization process ultimately yielded outstanding stability in the coefficients of the mask-to-CCD matrix, now characterized by minimal daily positioning variations, each less than a pixel.
