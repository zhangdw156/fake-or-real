So, getting VIMOS ready for action? It's like putting together a massive puzzle – each piece intricate and crucial to the overall picture. We're talking about a whole instrument, you see? But do they, really, have all this planned out *precisely*? 

And even more so when we add in the AFC system! The reference source for the AFC system is almost like an edge-of-the-field sort of thing – focusing becomes even trickier if defocus causes those centroids to wander. Plus, think about the conversion from pixel coordinates to millimetres at the mask plane: it's all tied to that AFC reference pixel now! Any change there? The entire mask-to-CCD matrix needs recalculating. We’re talking three different reference systems for VIMOS – they have to be aligned in a few tiny pixels out of 4000, and their alignment is paramount if we’re talking about multispectral observations. Even just those grisms! The six per arm, each needs to be perfectly aligned, making realignment of all those grisms like an ongoing process. We're talking about re-characterisation – a process that could take weeks even just after a minor shift in the focal plane of the detector!

We had to go through this several times during commissioning – it was time for us to get comfortable with all the new hardware, we learned some things along the way. The efficiency is certainly less than ideal, but the final results are remarkable. Our mask-to-CCD matrix stability is outstanding, and the daily positioning variations?  Well, they're barely a pixel wide!
