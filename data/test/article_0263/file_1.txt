astronauts are studying a special type called "BICEUIN," where a spinning Earthlike planet (the "A" part) is being powered up by material shed off another large flying giant (the "B" part). This new power source creates incredible bright light that's mostly invisible but can be seen using special telescopes called "Gari". The study will help us learn about how this powerful engine works and how it impacts everything around it!
Let me know if you need me to explain this further or want some other summaries!
