The system BP Cru consists of a neutron star (pulsar) pulling matter from a giant star (hypergiant). The giant's strong winds create bright emissions that can be studied using telescopes like GRAVITY, revealing much about this unusual binary system's structure and dynamics:
Giant Wind: The observations show that this giant star expels material far beyond what we normally see with typical stars - almost extending many times larger than itself!
Distortion: This gas seems distorted as it interacts with both gravity and radiation coming out from our neutron star – suggesting some sort interaction between these two forces near their respective objects!
Further study will help us understand if there are additional components within this system based on how these different aspects interact over time – especially how they change during different phases as they orbit each other!
