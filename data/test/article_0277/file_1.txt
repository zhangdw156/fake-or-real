This study examined whether articles published on arXiv receive more citations than those not uploaded there (non-arXiv). Using data from ADS for publications between January 2015 and July of each year studied, researchers compared citation rates for both groups using telbib paper sets already analyzed in previous research studies . They discovered that while some impactful non-arXiv articles exist, manuscripts submitted directly to arXiv consistently received an average of two point eight times more cites over their counterparts during this period - even when considering exceptions in impact among individual publications . This difference was statistically significant based on Kolmogorov Smirnov tests performed as part of this analysis . Additionally , they compared citation counts within random samples drawn from telbib paper sets collected during these years , finding that most Non - arXiv articles had low citation counts (from zero up to ten) followed by fewer with higher scores . Examples were given in publication years of both two thousand ten or twenty thirteen respectively .
