We analyzed how often articles published on arXiv receive citation recognition in relation to articles not hosted there (non-arXiv). Using data from ADS (Automated Discovery System) for publications between January 2 studies were performed comparing citation frequency across these two groups based on data collected during this time period (starting in January and ending in July of each respective year). Our analysis showed that articles submitted through arXiv received an average of double or even triple those seen among non-arxiv submissions within this timeframe . This difference was consistent across multiple years but limited by new publications having too little time available for sufficient citation accumulation . To confirm these findings further statistical tests were applied including Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov tests which confirmed significant differences between these two categories . Additionally , it was observed that many articles without an arxiv submission had very few or no citations at all , while others had relatively high ones . These observations were supported by comparisons made with random samples drawn from similar datasets in different years , providing further insight into potential contributing factors behind these trends .
