M87, a black hole located in the Virgo galaxy cluster, shares similar characteristics with Sgr A* , including size and mass, despite its immense distance. It emits radio waves from a fast-moving plasma jet, believed to be relativistic. This jet's structure is limited by observational data that indicates it occupies a small area around the black hole's event horizon, impacting understanding of jet formation models. Using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at high frequencies, scientists hope to map this region and gain insight into how these jets form in relation to discs. This research offers crucial information about black holes and their impact on surrounding matter. 
Furthermore, the study of relativistic jets using VLBI has led to investigations of blazars, observed by the Fermi satellite. These observations suggest that gamma flares associated with outbursts and ejections at millimeter wavelengths are directly connected.  This connection further emphasizes the significance of studying jet formation in the wider context of astronomical objects across different evolutionary stages.
