We aim to gain a comprehensive picture of our galaxy's structure: its disk's shape (including its bar patterns), its spiral arms distribution within it; how it changes vertically; how stars move through it; when these various parts formed together; and how they relate in terms of their composition (chemical) motion (kinematic).
By combining this detailed information about each component with historical context on their evolution over time we can piece together an accurate timeline for our galaxy's development from start to finish.
Finally we want a clear understanding not only on what makes up our galactic center but also how all these different parts interact between themselves - like connecting pieces within one big puzzle! This is done by meticulously covering vast areas within our galaxy using high quality data from both chemical composition star movement analysis for fruitsome conclusions about its evolution over time!
