We aim to improve our knowledge about how our galaxy is shaped - specifically its disk structure (spiral arms bar) and how it evolved over time through its movement within space interactions with other galaxies. This includes studying how various elements in our disk contribute to its overall evolution; specifically focusing on understanding how these elements interact over time within different regions like bulges their connections with surrounding areas like haloes. We will achieve this by combining detailed observations across different parts of our galaxy using Gaia data alongside chemical analysis motion tracking techniques for each region we observe .
