This project aims to study stellar populations using spectroscopy across vast areas due limited star densities near high galactic latitudes requiring extensive sky coverage (overly large). They plan an area spanning approximately 18 thousand square degrees covering around one million dwarfs giants down through magnitude G15..
The project focuses on characterizing diverse elements within individual star samples using multiple arms attached within their spectrograph system : Blue Arm (for very metal poor), Green Arm (for additional information) Red Arm (for H LiI). This allows them analyze various stellar types based upon their spectral features providing precise elemental abundances needed for distinguishing between various star populations like those found within dwarf galaxies or our own Milky Way's haloes .
Additionally they aim to gather data about binary star systems; understanding how these systems impact nucleosynthesis processes is crucial when analyzing element abundances within specific stellar atmospheres . They intend continuous observation over extended periods allowing them detect radial velocity variations associated with binary dynamics .
