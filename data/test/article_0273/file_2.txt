The SSO observatory consists four identical telescopes designed by Germany's ASTELCO company: they have been built as identical units all sharing common features like their mirrors being coated in pure aluminum at diameters ranging from one meter across their primary mirrors while incorporating two smaller secondary mirrors giving them combined f8 focal ratios which allow these telescopes great flexibility when capturing light from distant objects within space exploration research efforts . They feature robust construction using steel aluminum carbon fiber components allowing them withstand strong winds up until speeds reaching around fifty kilometers per hour . Each individual unit can be precisely controlled via motorized movement allowing it adjust its focus within five micrometers while being linked together via robotic mounts that offer quick slewing capabilities exceeding twenty degrees per second as well as highly accurate pointing abilities exceeding three arc seconds along with tracking accuracy surpassing one arc second over ten minutes without needing any extra assistance like automatic guiding systems . Another key element contributing towards precise photometry measurements involves keeping target stars fixed within specific pixel positions throughout every exposure sequence which helps ensure consistent data quality . These techniques rely on updated versions existing autoguiding systems known as DONUTS , utilizing references images across different fields that help create cross correlations between new images captured by these telescopes , essentially refining their positioning based on comparisons made against those references helping maintain stability even after extended exposures or periods without manual adjustments Each observatory houses six point five meters wide circular structures capped off by automated hemispheric wide slit domes fitted out alongside sophisticated automation systems also produced by ASTELCO allowing seamless operation thanks partly due its ability achieving azimuth rotations under just under one minute , minimizing time spent moving or adjusting these sensitive instruments.. Within this complex architecture there exists small control rooms devoted primarily towards commissioning activities such as equipment maintenance storage along side housing necessary computer hardware controls used for managing operations effectively . Lastly , careful spacing has been implemented between these individual observatories ensuring no vignetting occurs preventing shadowing effects caused when light interacts differently depending upon its direction especially when observing distant celestial bodies at various angles relative within Earths atmosphere .
