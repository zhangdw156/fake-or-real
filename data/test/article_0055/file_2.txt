Chile's government is funding an upgrade that connects the astronomical observatory at Cerro Paranal (a location known as "Paranal") directly into Chile's electrical grid using a high-voltage line (66kV). This project involves extending this line from Paposo (50km south) towards new substation equipment where smaller lines (23kV) will connect both Armazones observatory site with El Array Telescope site itself . This upgraded connection promises cost savings for ESO operations while allowing them access future green energy initiatives within northern Chile . The planned completion date is early second half year , coinciding perfectly with construction ramp up activities on Armazones site . To manage this transition smoothly , adjustments were made within existing electricity distribution systems at Paranals before connecting it into national grid . A separate project was also launched around mid-year , installing combined flywheeldiesel generators which would provide backup power alongside essential conditioning services by early next year . These generators replace older multi-fuel turbine generators currently used for electricity generation while also ending reliance on Liquefied Petroleum Gas procurement soon after installation completes.. Finally , no further large scale infrastructural changes are anticipated within or around El Array Telescope observatory facility during its lifetime nor any associated projects funded through either program or initiative dedicated specifically toward supporting its operation or development..
