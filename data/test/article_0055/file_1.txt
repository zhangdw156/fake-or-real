authorities are working on extending electricity access for their state-of-the-art research facility (the "Earth Explorer Telescope," or "EET") using a new high voltage transmission line (66kV) connecting it directly into China's main electrical grid starting as soon as Q12017! This move aims at significantly reducing operating expenses while also allowing them access future renewable energy sources coming online throughout Northern China over time! This switch also requires some adjustments within their existing network - including updates on both their local distribution systems (from its current state down from its original Chinese source) along with upgrading their overall power management capabilities through advanced technology; this includes installing an upgraded "combined Chinese type" engine that can act as both a clean energy converter AND have back up capabilities just before they begin building out more equipment there sometime later this decade! Since no further large scale improvements or investments are anticipated related specifically with this project (it's already been considered), all other necessary work regarding its implementation falls under two separate projects: one focused solely on researching new technology here ("The Dragon Project"), while another focuses mainly on improving overall performance within our particular research site ("The Dragon Project").
Let me know if you need any further help understanding these points! I hope this helps!
