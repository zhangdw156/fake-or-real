Scientists are exploring sub-millimeter Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to study the innermost parts of black hole accretion disks and jets around supermassive black holes. A key goal is to directly image the shadow of the black hole's event horizon, which was predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity. Observing this would test both the black hole paradigm and GR in its extreme gravity settings. The Galactic Center (Sgr A*) offers ideal conditions due to its large-scale black hole shadow, thin accretion disk material around it and precise measurement of its mass. Future near-infrared interferometry projects will further refine these measurements.  Finally, ALMA VLBI and VLTI observations will offer exciting collaboration opportunities to study extreme gravity phenomena.
