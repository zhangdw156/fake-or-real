The way we're planning this new survey relies on several key factors:
Selection criteria: We'll focus on objects based on their brightness in specific wavelengths (Z band), estimated redshift using other colors (u, g, r, i, z), and whether they have been clearly identified as stars or galaxies using color information combined with size measurements (half-light radius).
Survey goals: This design was created considering how well it can capture information about galaxy evolution over time by simulating how galaxies grow within clusters ("growth simulations"). To ensure high quality results we aim for a very low error rate (5) when selecting objects for observation â€“ meaning only reliable targets are chosen for further analysis! We also want this project aligned with existing large telescopes like 4MOST that can provide high resolution images needed for building detailed catalogs used by future studies like Euclid WFIRST space missions planned soon after completion!
This new approach improves upon previous surveys like SDSS GAMA by targeting areas where more distant galaxies reside while also pushing boundaries further back in time than ever before thanks its ability to observe at greater depths into space! Furthermore, we compare our project against many other upcoming projects that study similar topics but use different methods - highlighting how important our work will be within this broader field!
