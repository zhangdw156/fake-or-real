We're designing a new galaxy survey called WAVES using specific criteria like limiting light levels (Z band), estimated redshifts, stargalaxy separation using colorsize measurements, and observations with 4MOST telescope capabilities . This approach combines factors such as simulating galaxy growth, minimizing sampling variation within 5, achieving observability with 4MOST, available data for an input cataloguing system, and future multi-wavelength programs aimed at maximizing legacy value . We also consider how our footprint overlaps with upcoming Euclid WFIRST space missions while highlighting that WAVES surpasses previous surveys like SDSS GAMA in terms of reach (density), time scale covered (lookback time), area surveyed , minimum brightness limit ,and target density compared other existing or planned spectroscopic projects .
