Mrk 609 is a type of galaxy known as a starburst/Seyfert composite. This type of active galactic nucleus is ideal for examining the relationship between starbursts and active galactic nuclei because both aspects are equally active. Composite galaxies can be recognized by optical spectra that show strong starburst traits, while their X-ray brightness and fluctuations resemble those of Seyfert galaxies. These characteristics can be analyzed using emission-line diagnostic diagrams. Careful examination of the optical spectra often uncovers some weak Seyfert-like features, such as widened oxygen emissions in comparison to other lines or a faint broad hydrogen alpha line. They also bear similarities to narrow-line X-ray galaxies which have composite spectra. Although their soft X-ray emissions are smooth, it is still uncertain how their strong and intense X-ray emissions align with their weak optical Seyfert traits. The faintness of these galaxies in both X-ray and optical ranges has limited in-depth studies until now.
