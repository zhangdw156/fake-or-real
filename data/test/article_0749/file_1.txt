Mrk 609 is a type of galaxy known as a starburst/Seyfert composite. This type of active galactic nucleus is ideal for examining the relationship between starbursts and active galactic nuclei because both aspects show similar activity levels. Composite galaxies are recognized by optical spectra that show strong starburst traits, while their X-ray brightness and fluctuations resemble those of Seyfert galaxies. This is determined through emission-line diagnostic diagrams. A careful look at the optical spectra often shows faint Seyfert-like features, such as a broader oxygen III line compared to other narrow lines, or a weak broad hydrogen alpha line. They resemble narrow-line X-ray galaxies, which also exhibit composite spectra. Their soft X-ray spectra are flat, but it remains unclear how the intense and hard X-ray emissions connect with their weak optical Seyfert features. The low brightness of these galaxies in both X-ray and optical wavelengths has limited detailed studies of them.
