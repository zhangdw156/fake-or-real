Using observations made with MUSE instruments on telescopes like Hubble Space Telescope (HST), scientists are studying how active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are triggered within galaxies experiencing significant gas loss ("gas stripping"). They found that many actively "stripping" galaxies have powerful central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). This surprising discovery suggests that these SMBHs may be triggering or accelerating this process through processes like "ram pressure," where fast moving material pushes against surrounding clouds; however further research is needed before we fully understand how it works exactly!
