variegated analysis using spectroscopy techniques allows us to study how much matter becomes "ionized" (meaning it becomes part off a hot ionized form) within individual stars within our studied star systems . We found that many heavily stripped out bodies contain active galactic nuclei (AGNs), indicating they are frequently fueled by material being pulled into their center through intense gravity pull star systems are showing evidence star formations are even more common than we previously thought . It's likely that these events are driven by either excessive heatpressure forces pulling material toward them or some kind off star formation process driving them."
Let me know if you would like me elaborate on any specific aspect!
