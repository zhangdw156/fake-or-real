Classical bulges resemble low-brightness elliptical galaxies and are believed to form through mergers and rapid collapse. Pseudo-bulges are disc or bar structures that develop gradually from material that is gathered and effectively moved to the center of the galaxy where stars are formed. Pseudo-bulges can be identified by their shape, brightness, and movement patterns. The more characteristics examined, the more accurate the classification. Pseudo-bulges are expected to have more rotational motion compared to classical bulges, which in turn have more rotation than giant elliptical galaxies. We measured the maximum rotation speed Vmax within a radius rbd using the stellar velocity curve and the central velocity dispersion s0 from the velocity dispersion profile. For each galaxy, we calculated the ratio Vmax/s0. Another key feature of pseudo-bulges is their placement on the Faber-Jackson relation, with pseudo-bulges appearing above this correlation that relates the brightness of elliptical galaxies and early-type bulges to their central velocity dispersion. Bulges in our sample, except for ESO 358-50 and NGC 1292, align with the Faber-Jackson relation in the R-band. They show a lower velocity dispersion, or a higher brightness, compared to early-type galaxies. Based on our criteria, the bulge of NGC 1292 is identified as the most reliable pseudo-bulge in our study. Its stellar population provides additional insights into its characteristics and formation. The bulge population of NGC 1292 has an intermediate age and low metal content, with the lowest a/Fe enhancement in our sample, indicating a long history of star formation. The presence of emission lines in its spectrum indicates that star formation is still taking place. These traits suggest a gradual development of the NGC 1292 bulge in a scenario of secular evolution.
