To effectively study how galaxies clump together on large scales using lensed images from distant objects called "LRGs," scientists need specific types or categories within those objects that show strong gravitational effects when viewed across vast distances through space time - this makes them ideal "tracers."
The Cosmic Redshift Survey aims to identify these "LRGs" across different cosmic ages ("z" value), focusing on galaxies that were formed early after Big Bang expansion (z .7) when their gravitational influence was stronger due to dark energy dominating their evolution..
To pinpoint these objects accurately across various redshifts they've created specific categories like "BG", "LRG", "ELG", "QSO" ,and even specifically targeted quasars using Lyman forest absorption lines beyond redshift 2.. These different categories allow them access all redshifts from our universe's youngest stars now forming up until its oldest stars that have been around since just after Big Bang expansion began..
The team has designed two key areas where they will search: one larger part covering about seven thousand five hundred square degrees encompassing both bright galaxy clusters ("BG"), massive luminous red giants ("LRG"), quasars ("QSO") those emitting Lyman forest absorption lines (QSO - Ly ) plus another smaller section containing nearly one thousand square degrees reserved specifically for extremely faint galaxies called ELGs. Theyve combined data already collected by multiple telescopes like DESI KiDS so as not miss any potential candidates while also ensuring high image quality within this smaller section reserved solely for ELGs.
They also understand that reaching an adequate number within every category requires careful selection criteria based upon both brightnessmagnitude colorspectral features measured against existing reference catalogs like those found via observations made through telescopes such as VISTA Hemisphere Survey WISE â€“ allowing them fine tune their targeting strategy towards achieving maximum efficiency while maximizing our understanding about how galaxies evolved over time!
