On October 27, members of the PPARC Council visited the ESO Headquarters for a full day. They were greeted by ESO’s Director General, Dr. Catherine Cesarsky, and received a detailed update on major ESO activities, including the ongoing science work at the La Silla Paranal Observatory in Chile, and updates on the ALMA and OWL projects for a very large optical/near-IR telescope. The Council also learned about ESO’s extensive instrumentation program, considered one of the most ambitious in astronomy, as well as its industrial relations, technology transfer, and significant education and public outreach efforts. The members toured the ESO Science Data Archive and the Integration Hall, where new instruments are tested before being sent to Chile. Over lunch, they had the opportunity to meet UK and Commonwealth staff at the Headquarters.
