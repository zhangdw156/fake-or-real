On October 27, members of the PPARC Council visited the ESO Headquarters for a full day. They were received by ESO’s Director General, Dr. Catherine Cesarsky, and given a detailed update on major ESO activities, including the ongoing science work at the La Silla Paranal Observatory in Chile, and updates on the ALMA and OWL projects for extremely large telescopes. The ESO’s instrumentation program, noted as the most comprehensive in astronomy, along with its industrial relations, technology transfer, and substantial educational outreach efforts, were also presented. Council members were able to tour the ESO Science Data Archive and the Integration Hall, where new instruments are tested before being sent to Chile for observation. During lunch, they met with UK and Commonwealth staff based at Headquarters.
