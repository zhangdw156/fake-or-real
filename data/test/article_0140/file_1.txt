There's over half a million small celestial bodies orbiting our sun called "minor planets." Most reside within Mars' orbit up until Jupiter's orbit called "the Main Belt." These remnants help us understand how our solar system formed through studying them closely because they were part or building blocks during planet formation!
Beyond scientific curiosity about how they formed our solar system also has practical implications like finding resources useful for space exploration as well as mitigating potential threats from Earth impact events caused by asteroids or comets!
We know relatively little about many Minor Planets - only roughly thousands have been studied through spectroscopy or light curve analysis - but what we do know reveals surprising variety among them regarding composition density shape!
Several surveys have been launched recently including Sloan Digital Sky Survey(SDSS), Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer(WISE) that have given us information on around one hundred thousand Minor Planets but still need further research into understanding its full spectrum using specific wavelengths like Near infrared regions where we can identify important mineral compositions such as olivine pyroxene which gives us valuable insights into their origins evolution!
The VISTA telescope is conducting a large scale project called VHS that uses four Near infrared filter bands centered at different wavelengths – Y J H K – allowing it capture various key characteristics including those related to mineral content making it crucial tool towards revealing hidden details within this diverse group!
