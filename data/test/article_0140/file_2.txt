There's over half a million tiny celestial bodies called asteroids or Minor Planets orbiting our sun - mostly found between Mars's orbit Jupiter's orbit called Asteroid Main Belt.. These remnants help us understand how our solar system formed through studying them but also have practical uses like resource gathering protecting Earth from collisions with space rocks
We know very little about many asteroids – only about thousands have been studied using spectroscopy light curve analysis revealing surprising differences within them regarding composition shape
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Wide Field Infrared Surveyor Explorer(WISE) have helped us discover around one hundred thousand Minor Planets but reveal additional information on orbital behavior affecting their color and albedo suggesting turbulent solar system history
To understand their true makeup better we need deeper surveys – specifically focusing on near infrared wavelengths where key features that reveal composition reside - This is where Vista comes into play
The Vista Hemisphere Survey(VHS), is designed specifically to capture images across multiple Near infrared wavelengths – Y , J , H , K s allowing scientists to sample various mineral types like olivine or pyroxene responsible for unique absorption bands seen at different wavelengths . This will lead us closer towards building up an accurate picture on what they truly look like .
