The idea that supernovae (SNe) might be connected to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originated with Colgate. This prediction has been confirmed in recent years through extensive optical and near-infrared observations of GRB afterglows found by BeppoSAX. Research has demonstrated that long-duration GRBs, or at least many of them, are related to the collapse of massive stars. The strongest evidence comes from observing supernova features in the spectra of certain GRB afterglows. In other instances, signs of a supernova are based on late-time brightness increases seen in fading optical afterglows. Notable examples of this SN/GRB relationship include SN 1998bw/GRB 980425, SN 2003dh/GRB 030329, and SN 2003lw/GRB 031203. The average redshift of Swift GRBs is quite high, making it challenging to find an associated supernova. GRB 050525A, at redshift z = 0.606, is the first supernova linked to a GRB identified by Swift. Early photometric observations have been used to estimate the photometric redshift. The light curve, plotted for different optical and near-infrared bands, reveals a flattening starting about five days after the GRB explosion, followed by a significant dimming. The magnitude and duration of the flattening suggest a supernova component, which is slightly dimmer than the typical SN 1998bw and features a quicker rise to peak brightness. An early spectrum collected by Foley and colleagues using Gemini North and GMOS shows that GRB 050525A occurred in a star-forming galaxy. A spectrum taken with VLT UT1 + FORS2 during the flattening reveals strong similarities to the spectrum of SN 1998bw about five days post-maximum. Thus, this instance also shows a connection between a supernova and a gamma-ray burst. With a calculated frequency of about 4 × 10–6 GRBs per galaxy per year when accounting for jet angle, the overall rate is approximately 4 × 10–4 GRBs per galaxy per year, roughly 1/30th that of Ibc supernovae. Although establishing a clear SN/GRB connection has advanced GRB research, it also raises new questions. It remains to be seen whether this association is limited to bright supernovae, as suggested by cases with confirmed spectra, or if it includes fainter type-Ibc supernovae as well, which will require further observations. By analyzing a sufficiently large sample, we may eventually uncover the physical mechanism behind this connection and understand how these explosions progress over time. The short GRBs 050709 and 050724 show no signs of a supernova, despite being relatively nearby.
