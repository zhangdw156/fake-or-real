We're pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the universe!  As part of a massive undertaking to map and analyze the most dense stellar regions in our galaxy, we have gathered GTO OmegaCAM images spanning u-, B-, and V-bands across an area of roughly one degree per field over 45 locations – encompassing 46 WINGS clusters. This data provides valuable insight for the large spectroscopic follow-up campaign underway using AAOmega on the AAT.  We call this extended survey “OmegaWINGS,” which draws upon 57 known WINGS clusters visible from the VST (δ < +20 degrees). We've meticulously targeted these clusters, randomly selecting 46 of them to observe via OmegaCAM pointings. These observations started in October 2011 and wrapped up in September 2014, utilizing a total exposure time of 25 minutes for both B- and V-band. We managed seeing conditions that were stellar: less than 1.3 arcseconds (and even lower at 1.2 arcseconds) for nearly 80% of the observed images with a median value of just 1.0 arcseconds in both B- and V-band observations.  Figure 2 showcases the OmegaCAM V-band image of A2399, highlighting its stunning clarity. We also compare the projected radius (R200) of our clusters, their field of view (FoV) as well as the details of the complete photometric survey for both B- and V-bands - all within the context of WINGS imaging.
