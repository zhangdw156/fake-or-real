Scientists are trying to understand how galactic disks transitioned from chaotic behavior with turbulent dynamics early on during their development towards smoother rotation patterns we see today within nearby galaxies like barred ones studied through research called TIMER project . The theory suggests that bars only appear after galaxy disks have settled down due their dynamic evolution over time . This process also occurs around hundreds or millions years later when new bars form leading up to changes like shock waves caused by non-symmetrical forces created from newly formed bars causing cold interstellar matter (gas) inside them to fall towards their center . These changes result in star formations like rings or spiral arms within those centers over time . Researchers are looking for clues about when this happened using observations made with MUSE instrument capable enough detail analysis for studying star populations including kinematic studies across different parts within those galactic centers .
