The main ESO archive query form is a web tool that allows users to search the ESO archive using Target Name, Coordinates, Observing Date, or Programme ID. Users can specify the type of observations they want (such as Imaging, Spectroscopy, or Interferometry) and whether they need Science or Calibration frames. Depending on the amount of data requested, the query can take from a few seconds to several minutes. The results are displayed in a table that includes details like frames, position, programme ID, exposure time, and filter, along with two summary tables showing the total number of frames and exposure times categorized by instrument or exposure time/instrument/filter. VirGO provides a more visual alternative to this traditional query form, showing available data, their overlaps, and instrument footprints while allowing users to filter the data in real-time before querying the ESO archive. This approach poses challenges in user interface design, such as displaying multiple observations without causing confusion and intuitively filtering and selecting relevant observations. A key feature of VirGO is its ability to manage large data sets on both the client and server sides and to communicate with other VO tools. This is made possible by VO standards, including the Simple Image Access/Simple Spectral Access (SIA/SSA) protocols for retrieving images and spectra from various astronomical databases through a consistent interface, and the PLASTIC protocol for communication with other VO tools.
