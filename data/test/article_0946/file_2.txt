The main means of accessing the ESO archive is through a web form that enables users to search based on Target Name, Coordinates, Observing Date, or Programme ID. Users can choose the type of observations (like Imaging, Spectroscopy, or Interferometry) and the Category (Science or Calibration frames). Depending on how much data is requested, searching may take from a few seconds to several minutes. The results are presented in a table containing frame information such as position, programme ID, exposure time, and filter. Additionally, there are two summary tables showing the total number of frames and exposure times by instrument or by exposure time/instrument/filter categories. VirGO provides an alternative to this standard query process by visually displaying the available data, its overlaps, and instruments’ attributes while allowing users to filter resultant data in real-time before querying the ESO archive. This method poses challenges in designing a user interface that can clearly show and navigate many observations concurrently and facilitate easy selection of relevant data. A key feature of VirGO is its ability to work with large sets of data on both the user’s device and the server, alongside communicating with other VO tools. These capabilities are a result of adhering to VO standards, with SIA/SSA protocols for images and spectra retrieval and PLASTIC for interconnecting with other VO applications.
