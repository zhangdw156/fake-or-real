A rare system has been discovered where two planet-sized stars of different colors orbit each other. One star is a hot white dwarf that is slightly less than half the mass of the Sun, while the other is a cooler brown dwarf with a mass equivalent to 55 Jupiterâ€™s. Pierre Maxted, the main author of the research published on August 3 in Nature, noted that this system likely has a tumultuous history, as it indicates that the brown dwarf emerged almost unchanged from a past event in which it was engulfed by a red giant star. The two stars, which are less than one third the radius of the Sun apart or just a few thousandths of the Earth-Sun distance, orbit each other approximately every 2 hours. Initially, the two stars were not this close; the separation narrowed significantly only when the star that eventually became the white dwarf transformed into a red giant, which then enveloped its companion. The companion star spiraled in towards the giant's core, and eventually, the giant's outer layers were ejected, resulting in a binary system with the companion in close orbit around the white dwarf. The distance between the two stars will continue to decrease over time. The companion star a low-mass white dwarf named WD0137-349 was identified using spectra collected with EMMI on the NTT, followed by extensive measurements and analysis using the UVES spectrograph on the VLT to determine its orbital period and mass ratio.
