A rare system has been discovered where two planet-sized stars of different colors orbit each other. One star is a hot white dwarf that is slightly less than half the mass of the Sun, while the other is a cooler brown dwarf with a mass of 55 Jupiter masses. “This system likely has a complex history,” said Pierre Maxted, the lead author of the study published in the 3 August issue of Nature. “Its existence indicates that the brown dwarf emerged nearly unchanged from a phase when it was engulfed by a red giant.” The two stars are less than one-third the radius of the Sun apart, or just a few thousandths of the distance between the Earth and the Sun, and they orbit each other approximately every two hours. In the past, the stars were not so close; it was only when the star that is now a white dwarf was a red giant that their distance significantly shrank. At that time, the giant engulfed its companion, which then spiraled toward the giant's core. The outer layer of the giant was eventually ejected, leading to a binary system where the companion orbits closely around the white dwarf. The distance between the two stars will gradually decrease. The low-mass companion to the white dwarf, named WD0137-349, was identified using spectra collected with EMMI on the NTT. Astronomers then employed the UVES spectrograph on the VLT to gather 20 spectra, which allowed them to measure the orbital period and mass ratio.
