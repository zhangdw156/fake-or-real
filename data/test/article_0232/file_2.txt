The CASU team processed eight years worth (P81 - P96) of observations from both HAWKI's stacked jittered image files its corresponding variance arrays confidence maps along with the catalogued sources within those files plus fully tiled versions at each exposure level along with similar details about VIMOS's dataset spanning twelve years (P71 - P96). They also delivered master calibration frames which included standard star fields their catalogs used during this process . Combined this amounts to approximately five terabytes worth of processed scientific datasets three terabytes worth mastered calibrations which represent an important contribution towards further research within ESOs scientific archive system .
The processing itself faced challenges due to how unevenly distributed raw observational datasets were across both instruments – think about it like trying fit together pieces from multiple jigsaw puzzles! There were hundreds or thousands unique observation programs conducted on each instrument involving diverse projectssurveys utilizing various techniquesfilters over time .
To assess image quality they compared every single object catalogued within each instrument against a reference catalog called "Two Micron All Sky Survey" or "Two Micron All Sky Survey". This revealed high accuracy on average around three hundred milliarcsecond precision but some outliers showing up as much higher inaccuracies around five hundred milliarcsecond discrepancies when dealing with defocused imaging sessions .
They then compared specific objects across both instruments against "Two Micron All Sky Survey" based on eleven distinct filter options including narrow band options utilized by HAKWI , achieving an impressive success rate where roughly eighty two percent had magnitudes differing by less than one tenth magnitude while ninety two percent had values differing by less than half a magnitude!
These findings suggest there might be slight discrepancies between their results compared against Two Micron All Sky Survey due primarily because bright stars often get saturated during observations leaving only faint stars usable as reference points when calibrating measurements . Limiting comparisons solely based on broad band filter selection would improve this further—think about it like focusing your telescope lens!
