astronauts on Earth had their first taste at getting up close to Earth's airwaves! A team named "NASA" worked hard over an extended period on this project called "Mimoas". They focused on two robotic robots called "Crew Dragon" which were designed specifically for deep sea exploration missions down into our planet's oceans!
These robots will soon begin their crewed missions starting next year so stay tuned!
Let me know if you want any further details about this mission or about what NASA has planned next!
Let me know if you would like an even shorter version or something else entirely!
