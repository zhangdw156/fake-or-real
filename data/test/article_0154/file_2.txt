The Science Organising Committee made an effort for equal representation by selecting eight guest speakers based on their expertise in their respective fields without considering gender bias or other factors like nationality or age group This resulted in an even split between male and female speakers (approximately). Attendees came from diverse regions around five continents - Europe being most heavily represented followed by North America then Asia etc., reflecting global reach but also highlighting geographic diversity among attendees as well as within presentations given . Women were equally represented in both abstract submissions (representing roughly half) and talk allocations (also representing roughly half). This suggests successful mitigation against gender biases during selection process . Young researchers like graduate students were well-represented across different career stages including those just starting out through tenure-track professors who have established themselves professionally . High attendance at around one hundred people is attributed partly due to scientific relevance and affordability making it accessible for individuals across career levels..
