APEX, ALMA (Chajnantor), and VLT (Paranal) have key differences in how they conduct science observations. One significant distinction is that APEX, ALMA, and Chajnantor can observe continuously around the clock, while the instruments at Paranal only operate during nights. This difference also involves how they use atmospheric conditions for observations.  Atmospheric transparency strongly affects science done using millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. Therefore, PWV (path-averaged water vapor) is crucial when scheduling observations at Paranal. In contrast to the instruments on APEX, ALMA, and Chajnantor, the VLT instruments require more specific environmental constraints like good seeing conditions, dark skies, and stable light from the instruments themselves.  Cirrus clouds are a prime example of this issue. During their formation, these clouds often release water vapor into the atmosphere, decreasing PWV, and ultimately impacting observations on Paranal's instruments since atmospheric transparency changes due to cloud formation can significantly influence results in observation conditions. The weather prediction model (GFS) is useful for scheduling observations for APEX, ALMA, and Chajnantor, but may require other information like local factors for a better understanding of VLT's impact and the best way to proceed with observations at the Paranal site.
