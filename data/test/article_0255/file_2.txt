A comparison shows strong agreement between data from two separate instruments (MSl Xsl) for multiple space missions (both relate back to Earth). While there was great accuracy within each instrument's own set(s) of data points it was found there were significant discrepancies when comparing both sets together on a large scale - this could be due to factors like how much information was being collected at any given moment or how well those moments were captured through an individual mission or set(s) . Additionally it was found that while they were able to produce good quality images they did not capture as accurate details as one would hope for - this could be explained by several factors including how much information they collected at any given moment or how well those moments were captured through an individual mission or set(sets). For example NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope produced high quality images but also had issues with its launch platform which affected its performance during flight plus other technical problems that required engineers work around so it wasn't quite what it could have been . There are many potential explanations behind these findings! But ultimately scientists must continue working hard on improving our technology so we can get better results next time around!
Explanation:
The original text explains some issues with comparing data from two different systems used for ground based astronomy:
Target Data: The experiments compare real world scientific observations made by two separate technologies known as "MSl" "Xsl", whose purpose was designed specifically for making detailed measurements about distant objects using complex machinery called "Earth based telescopes." These observations include everything about every single object being studied such as their color , distance etc..
Focus Point: The first step involves taking many pictures with each system side by side allowing scientists then compare them carefully because there might not always be perfect overlap between what each one sees! They then looked at specific details like whether there are small errors where things got mismatched up during creation process even if everything else matched up perfectly!
Space Program Challenges: It also highlights challenges inherent in space science missions like ground based telescopes such as dealing with errors caused by launch vehicle vibrations during flight plus technical problems requiring extra effort just getting all parts working properly before even attempting flight . One example cited here relates back again about Spitzer Telescope where some parts needed constant attention due mechanical issues making things harder than expected initially but still worked out okay thanks hard work by thousands who worked toward solving these problems along their journey towards completing their main goal...which was scientific discovery itself !
Let me know if you need further clarification on any part!
