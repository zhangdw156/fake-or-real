The data from six individual observations showed strong consistency with each other when compared to each other using an instrument called MUSE (Multi Unit Spectrograph). A direct comparison was made between two instruments: the M(ulti-)Spectrum Line (MSL) and X(ray)-Shooter Line (XLS) . The results showed good agreement at smaller scales but discrepancies emerged at larger scales where there were differences in intensity levels across wavelengths used by both instruments.. This suggests there might be discrepancies in how they capture light from stars , potentially affecting how accurately their measurements match up . Despite this difference , researchers found that using both instruments produced similar color information about stars which confirms that both methods are useful for studying stellar properties . However it was noted that variations could occur due to limitations with data processing techniques used by each instrument as well as potential mixing of light signals captured by all three arms within one single instrument .
