SEPIA is an advanced radio telescope designed specifically to work with ALMA's technology on APEX observatory's telescope mount . It can house up to three separate receivers similar to those used on ALMA itself , currently including bands covering both high energy radiation from space like Bands Band and another that focuses on even higher energy radiation .
The entire project took only about one year from conception through construction due largely thanks to dedicated teams working together across multiple institutions like Onsala Space Observatory . This allows it access certain wavelengths not possible with other telescopes due its unique ability to observe very specific types or ranges within electromagnetic waves .
