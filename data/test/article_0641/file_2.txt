In early 2011, ESO completed the construction of its cryogenic system and delivered it to CRAL in Lyon.  MUSE, another crucial component developed by IAG, IRAP, and AIP followed shortly thereafter. These components were assembled, and an initial integral field unit was placed inside. A series of mirrors and lenses for splitting and relay optics were aligned so that light from the instrument could reach the detector plane, resulting in "first light" in late December 2011. Fine adjustments are ongoing, but it's clear that the system produces excellent images.  Meanwhile, a significant amount of effort has been put into developing software for controlling and analyzing data. Tests with simulated astrophysical objects have already shown the instrument can handle the large volume of data it generates.  24 individual channels are being aligned along with the remaining integral field units, while tests of overall performance will be conducted in Europe and finalized by an early acceptance review in October 2012. Once validated, the instrument will go to Paranal for the reintegration and commissioning phase which is expected to take most of 2013.
