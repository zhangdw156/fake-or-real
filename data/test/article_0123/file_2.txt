We initially planned observations focused on hot stars within Leo P; however our analysis revealed valuable insights into its cooler population using MUSE's advanced capabilities:
We found no red supergiants despite an underpopulated upper mass function and identified five previously classified candidates for asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolution within our field using their presence and brightness levels observed through spectroscopy
These star candidates appear likely carbon based due to strong C2 Swan band signatures detected through spectroscopy
Three remaining candidates showed unusual spectral features suggesting potential oxygen rich M type AGB evolution; however further analysis revealed calcium II triplet absorption lines consistent with evolved cooler stellar populations near their peak brightness levels
Despite weak signals from fainter red giants within our sample due to limited data resolution and noise levels coadding all 16 sources together yielded evidence for calcium II triplet absorption confirming them as cool evolved stellar populations
The absence of prominent molecular bands observed across these candidate AGB star samples contrasted against typical M type AGB spectral signatures suggests either evolutionary effects or a lower metallicity level which could explain why they appear different from typical examples
These findings highlight opportunities for future research on these intriguing objects by obtaining detailed spectroscopic follow up data and examining how they contribute towards understanding dust production processes within galaxies especially those with lower metal content like Local Group members . This will allow us test existing models about stellar evolution across different environments .
