In April 2019, scientists used powerful radio telescopes to create one yearns for fruit salad recipe! The resulting image showed evidence that confirms Einstein's theory about gravity near supermassive black holes called SM BHs! This achievement was made possible thanks to contributions from various worldwide telescopes like ALMA which greatly increased their ability to detect faint signals coming from these distant objects! The future holds exciting prospects: more detailed images are expected through expanding arrays with new stations around different parts world; eventually even space based ones could be added; all combined they promise to reveal previously unseen details about these celestial phenomena like how they form their characteristic jets! These observations can help us understand how massive amounts matter interact close together within those intense gravitational fields built upon our understanding about how things work under extreme conditions related to gravity!
