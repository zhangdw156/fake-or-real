In April 2019, scientists released for the first time ever images taken from Earth showing what we believe to be supermassive black holes at their centers using data from several radio telescopes around Earth including ALMA . This groundbreaking achievement confirmed Einstein's theory about gravity after decades working towards this goal . The high resolution images allows us to see directly how they interact with surrounding matter through observation using electromagnetic radiation . In future years , new telescopes are planned across multiple continents , eventually including satellites in space , further improving our ability to capture these events . These combined efforts promise to reveal crucial insights about how these objects interact with their surroundings while also providing increasingly accurate testing grounds for Einstein's theories within extreme conditions where gravity reigns supreme .
