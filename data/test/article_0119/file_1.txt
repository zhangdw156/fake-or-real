The article discusses how celestial events like moonlight contribute to observing astronomical phenomena like Zodiacal Light around ESO observatories' locations at Paranal La Silla (Chile).
It explains that during nights free from moonlit skies (like those found at these observatories), viewers may witness various atmospheric wonders alongside this faint glowâ€”including airglow (natural radiation emitted by Earths atmosphere) and electrical storm-related flashes known as sprites visible over nearby Andes mountains during clear nights .
Additionally ,the article highlights how even though most people associate this phenomenon with twilight hours or dawn moments ,it actually persists throughout most nights when viewed under optimal conditions . This includes its appearance as a thin bridge across dark skies which then becomes brighter close to sunrise .
