We investigated the amount of time needed to reach a noise floor when the signal-to-noise ratio becomes limited by systematic effects associated with errors in sky continuum subtraction. To do this, we repeated the measurements in samples of different sizes that simulate different integration times. The results are shown. At short integration times, the remaining error is primarily caused by random photon noise and decreases as the square root of the integration time until it reaches a fixed level. Due to our sample size limitations, accurately measuring this decrease was difficult, but a gradual decrease followed by a fixed value can be observed. This floor value is reached after 10-25 hours of integration at approximately 0.6%. At longer integration times, the local residual error starts being dominated by systematic effects from sky continuum subtraction. The trend we saw is similar to that found at 600 nm, with a ~0.3% floor after 70-100 hours of integration. Additionally, it is interesting to note that the 0.6% floor in residual local error is very close to the measured variations of the sky continuum background, which range from approximately 0.3 to 0.7%. This suggests long-exposure observations could remove much of the instrumental inaccuracies and reach the physical limit due to sky continuum variations. The 0.3% floor found may be due to smaller variations in the 600 nm sky continuum compared to wavelengths around 900 nm that we are analyzing here. It is important to note that these results were obtained on one-dimensional spectra under suboptimal conditions. Increasing the sophistication of data reduction procedures and controlling instrument design to minimize potential inaccuracies could potentially reduce this floor and allow for shorter integration times. The results also support the idea that controlling and measuring instrumental scattered light remains the main challenge for accurate spectroscopy of faint sources. We argued above that these results should apply up to the J-band, but it is important to confirm them and characterize sky continuum variations at even longer wavelengths where the impact of scattered light continues to increase. The results reported here strongly suggest that the problem with the sky continuum subtraction is not a barrier to studying very faint sources with fiber-fed spectrographs. Given the flexibility of these systems, they are likely to play a significant role in the future generation of multi-object instruments such as MOONS for the VLT or MOSAIC for the E-ELT.
