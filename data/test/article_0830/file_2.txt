In the future, there will be a strong focus on measuring the Galactic Centre using infrared interferometers like the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), and comparing these to other low-luminosity galactic nuclei. Infrared interferometry has begun with observations of the bright dust-covered star IRS 3 using MIDI at the VLTI. In 2005, we collected data on the UT3–UT4 (6 meters) and UT1–UT4 (130 meters) baselines. We plotted measured visibilities along with a two-component model, where the inner component has a size of 20 milliarcseconds (160 astronomical units) and the outer component has a size of 50 milliarcseconds (400 astronomical units). The wavelength-dependent flux density ratios of the two components allow us to estimate blackbody temperatures, yielding 90 ± 100 Kelvin for the hotter inner component and 510 ± 50 Kelvin for the cooler outer component. This supports the idea that IRS 3 is a bright compact object in a heavy dust-forming phase and suggests that such sources may significantly add to the dust in the Galactic Centre. Although many other mid-infrared bright sources in the Galactic Centre, like IRS 1W, 2, 8, 9, 10, and 13W, are more spread out and currently undetected by MIDI, we recently successfully obtained fringes for the compact supergiant IRS 7 in the N-band with MIDI on the UT2–UT3 (47 meters) and in the K-band with AMBER on UT1–UT3 (10 meters) and UT3–UT4 (6 meters). The compact nature of IRS 7 is particularly important as it can act as a fringe tracker in future experiments at longer near-infrared/mid-infrared wavelengths. AMBER observations will be well-suited for studying apparent and physical binaries in the Galactic Centre (1 milliarcsecond is about 8 astronomical units). A detailed analysis of the diffuse emission and dust-covered sources at the Galactic Centre is crucial for understanding the interstellar medium in the central parsec.
