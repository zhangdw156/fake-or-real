HAWK-I equipped with GRAAL can detect sources that are 1.5 magnitudes fainter compared to using HAWK-I alone, at the same integration time. GRAAL enhances HAWK-I's capability for deep imaging with high spatial resolution. Importantly, HAWK-I with GRAAL can achieve the same magnitude limit as VISTA 16 times faster. Thus, even though it has a smaller field of view, HAWK-I with GRAAL can survey the same area at half the speed of VISTA while delivering at least twice the spatial resolution. Key scientific applications for HAWK-I include deep multi-color surveys at high redshifts, studies of stellar populations in nearby galaxies, and research into star-forming regions within our Galaxy. These projects particularly depend on the deepest exposures and highest spatial resolution, both of which will be enhanced by GRAAL. With a fixed exposure time, HAWK-I with GRAAL typically reaches 0.5 magnitudes deeper in J, H, and K bands. For high-redshift observations, this represents a distance gain of 1.26, enabling the survey to probe 25% more volume in the same timeframe. When studying galaxies at a specific redshift or stellar populations in a nearby galaxy, this leads to significantly increased sample sizes, as the galaxy luminosity function grows exponentially and stellar mass increases sharply in the relevant range. Leading scientific inquiries often necessitate the best seeing conditions; presently, the K-band natural seeing is below 0.4 only 20% of the time. With GRAAL, imaging in the K-band below 0.4 will occur 80% of the time. GRAAL will effectively quadruple the available time for tackling the most demanding proposals.
