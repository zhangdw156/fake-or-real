ALMA observations of the detached shell in molecular gas at R Scl offer the highest resolution images yet. The resolution of CO(3-2) observations in Band 7 is approximately 1.4 arcseconds, allowing direct comparison between the distribution of dust and gas. ALMA observations, based on stellar velocity and polarized observations with PolCor, show the distribution of gas and dust within the shell plane, respectively.  The contours of ALMA's observations closely match the emission seen in polarized intensity. Notably, deviations from a perfect spherical shape are identical in both observations (most prominently, the flattening of the shell in the south). This indicates that the gas and dust have a nearly identical distribution, suggesting they evolved together since the detached shell formed. This is different from other detached shell sources like U Ant, where there was a clear separation between dust and gas. The shell around U Ant is approximately twice as old as the one around R Scl. The reason for the difference in these objects is not clear – whether it’s due to evolutionary effects or differences in dust-gas interactions.
