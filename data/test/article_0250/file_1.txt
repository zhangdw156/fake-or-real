APEX uses an automated process called "online" calibration before taking spectral line measurements with its telescope feed:
The system compares blank sky readings with hot objects heated near room temperature and cold objects cooled down with liquid nitrogen during separate scans called "SKY-HOT-COLD". These comparisons help determine how much heat has been absorbed by each part of our receiving antenna system that we use for astronomy research!
These measurements allow us then calculate how cold or hot our receiving antenna system really was during observation time! Using both readings we also can calculate what kind of weather conditions were present when taking those measurements - which helps us correct any effects from those conditions affecting our findings!
Finally using that information about weather conditions as well as specific elevation locations where these images were taken we can determine how much light gets through different layers in Earth's atmosphere causing some light loss which impacts results!
However this method isn't perfect: When observing near certain frequencies like around 183 GHz where water molecules absorb more light there's not enough information available within one scan so it requires an additional offline process where they break down their calculations into smaller chunks (like every other channel) which provides more accurate results but requires more time because they have multiple steps involved; this means that sometimes our initial estimates dont completely capture all details needed so they need additional analysis after observing times have passed
They want to improve their "online" method by creating better algorithms so that these corrections become less necessary by providing higher accuracy even when dealing with complex scenarios involving various frequencies like those found near water absorption bands â€“ ultimately improving scientific discoveries made through APEX Telescope!
