The original VIMOS detectors used CCDs (charge-coupled devices) from e2v that were very clean and performed well in the blue and visible light spectrum ranges. However, they suffered from fringing at longer wavelengths, causing a significant change in their sensitivity. This meant that changes of even small amounts in the light's wavelength could lead to a 40% variation in their sensitivity at around 850 nm.  This hampered the ability to obtain high-quality spectroscopy, particularly when flexure was present. The new detectors also come from e2v and use the same format as before, but with silicon that is more than twice as thick. This thicker silicon has significantly reduced fringing, allowing for no more than a 2% change in sensitivity at most. These changes don't cause noticeable variations even when using the LR-Red grating or imaging. As a result, the raw spectrum from this new detector format appears nearly usable, simplifying analysis and enhancing the quality of the results, especially for faint red objects.
