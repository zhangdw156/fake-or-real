The PIONIER mission took a giant leap in our understanding of planet formation. Its goals? To deliver pinpoint precision, peering deep into protoplanetary discs around stars of various sizes and masses, capturing vital information from those nascent worlds. Imagine analyzing the dust clouds that birthed planets – this is the power of PIONIER! 

These star systems with massive or intermediate-mass (Herbig AeBe) young stars provided ideal candidates for aperture synthesis due to their impressive angular extent, allowing us to study these dynamic environments at a detail never seen before. We can even peek into the inner rim of their discs, unmasking hidden details about the formation and evolution of planets!

PIONIER's advanced sensitivity allows us to finally break the "T Tauri barrier" –  meaning we can now observe young star systems in unprecedented detail with images that reveal their structure at a level never before possible. 

By capturing these direct images of young stellar systems, PIONIER offers unique insights into planet-forming processes like the dramatic gaps in emission signals, providing crucial data for studying the intricate evolution of planetary systems.  

Pionier's observations are incredibly complementary to advanced disc modeling using Spitzer and Herschel data, enabling us to identify specific areas within these discs that hold crucial clues to their dynamics. PIONIER also holds a key role in finding stellar, substellar, and maybe even hot planetary companions in the process! 


This is just the beginning of PIONIER's exploration! Its precision allows us to glimpse into the complex interplay of dust, gas, and radiation that drives planet formation around massive stars. This mission pushes the boundaries of observational astronomy by targeting these systems with milliarcsecond accuracy, allowing for unprecedented insights into the workings of stellar environments across various evolutionary stages.
