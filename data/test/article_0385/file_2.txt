PIONIER's initial goal was to gather detailed images (diagnostics) of star-forming environments at a specific distance from the starâ€”1 astronomical unit (AU). This will help us understand how planets might form in these environments. The project targets various stages of planet formation around stars of different masses, and focuses on regions with dust clouds (massive and intermediate-mass Herbig AeBe young stars).  These regions are suitable for using aperture synthesis, allowing scientists to study the structure of the inner region of their protoplanetary discs using direct images. The project aims to obtain direct images of the dust/gas rim's morphology, its vertical structure, and clumpiness. Additionally, it will analyze dust properties and the impact of extended scattering envelopes on energy balance.  PIONIER has increased observational sensitivity that can now observe young stars with similar conditions as our own solar system, providing unprecedented clarity for studying their evolution. Observing these stars during various stages will help determine if there are planet-forming signals such as gaps in emitted radiation. PIONIER is complementary to modeling of protoplanetary discs based on Spitzer and Herschel data, offering precise information on the inner disc boundary and emission patterns. PIONIER also aims to observe stellar, substellar, and potentially hot planets around these stars.  Finally, this project aims to reach a level of precision that allows for direct observation of "hot dust" found around debris discs host stars. The sensitivity and mapping capability of PIONIER opens new opportunities for studying features as small as 1 milliarcsecond (mas), like interacting binary systems, stellar surfaces, and Wolf-Rayet stars.
