tanleriased on data from ALMA's longest baselines combined with short wavelengths from bands nine ten allows for detailed imaging capable of resolving features as small as six arcseconds across - this allows us to determine much about this exoplanet's structure like how close it is related by studying light emitted by material revolving around it . The very large telescope interferometer(VLTI), along side other tools such as gravity which are due out soon can help us understand things like composition based on light emitted by various components , including potential gas disks or "molspheres" that surround stars . These studies can help us understand how planets form their atmospheres through interactions between themselfs , their host stars ,and surrounding matter . This research uses existing technology but also anticipates future capabilities offered by even larger telescopes such as ELT which promises even greater detail allowing researchers better grasp on early solar system formation process .
