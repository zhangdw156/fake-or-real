Using ALMA's powerful telescopes combined with advanced instruments like VLTI's VINCI on Earth can help astronomers study details like gas disks around stars like L2 Pup B that are similar size as our sun but much further away from us! They can use this information along side data from telescopes like ELT which are even more powerful than current ones on Earth too see how gas interacts around this specific star system helping scientists unlock secrets about how planets form! This research could shed light on how planets form within our own solar system by studying how matter moves throughout space surrounding these stars over time!
