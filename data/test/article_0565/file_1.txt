The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is making remarkable advancements in Earth observation and atmospheric research, with a strong focus on understanding the atmosphere's complexities. 

Take, for example, the phenomenon of airglow. While Earth's atmosphere experiences ultraviolet light exposure during the day, leading to photodissociation and complex chemical reactions, atomic oxygen (O) remains prevalent even after sunset due to its longer lifetime in the upper atmosphere. This stored chemical energy also plays a crucial role at night. When exposed to further reactions and collisions, elements like molecular oxygen (O2), sodium (Na), and hydroxyl radicals (OH) are produced and emit radiation through chemiluminescence.

Indian scientists have been developing innovative techniques to study this phenomenon. Astronomers employ specialized methods to analyze ground-based spectral data that reveal intricate details of airglow. These observations, encompassing a range of wavelengths from near-ultraviolet to near-infrared, highlight the abundance and distribution patterns of various elements, like OH (hydroxyl radical), within the upper atmosphere. 

The impact of these findings is significant as it provides insights into the dynamics of chemical reactions occurring in the atmosphere, with implications for various research areas like climate change monitoring. Recently, researchers have tackled the challenge of removing airglow lines from telescope images using sophisticated algorithms and techniques. These advancements offer valuable data to scientists who are working on understanding the intricate workings of Earth's atmospheric chemistry.   

It is worth noting that ISRO's efforts are not just focused on ground-based observations; they also leverage advanced space telescopes, such as the VLT Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA), to study airglow and other celestial phenomena from a broader perspective. This approach complements their terrestrial research programs, paving the way for significant contributions in both atmospheric science and astrophysics.
