The Earth's atmosphere contains ultraviolet light that breaks down molecular oxygen into separate atoms during daylight and triggers chemical reactions after sunset.  This makes atomic oxygen linger in the upper atmosphere, acting as a store of stored energy available at night. This atomic oxygen allows for the formation of other chemicals like molecular oxygen (O2), oxygen (O), sodium (Na), and hydroxyl radicals (OH) that release radiation through a process called chemiluminescence. Astronomers must adjust their observations to remove airglow emissions lines from ground-based spectra. These emissions, found in the near ultraviolet to near infrared, are characterized by narrow emission lines clustered together. This structure is most prominent in the near infrared where the strongest airglow lines (OH bands) occur and creates patterns that pose challenges for removing them during observation.  The VLT Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) provides an example of this, where the OH airglow structures shift across multiple exposures on its wide array of CCD chips due to their temporal displacement after twilight.
