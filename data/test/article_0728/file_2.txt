The session provided an overview of Adaptive Optics (AO) simulations for the Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), presented by Miska Le Louarn, and showcased Gavin Dalton's talk on detectors for optical and near-infrared (NIR) imaging. This included future technological advancements that could significantly influence the practicality of wide-field imaging with ELTs. Le Louarn focused on the results of simulations for Ground Layer Adaptive Optics (GLAO). The primary aim of GLAO is to enhance visibility over a "wide" field of view, rather than achieving diffraction limit results, by correcting atmospheric turbulence as averaged across many natural guide stars or laser guide stars. In this context, "wide‚Äù field means areas of 5 to 7 arcminutes. Simulations conducted in the K-band indicate that image quality could increase by up to 50% compared to natural seeing when three natural guide stars (NGS) are used. However, using three NGS introduces limits based on star brightness, restricting sky coverage to roughly 50%, although better efficiency and dimmer stars may help. Using three laser guide stars could expand sky coverage, but it complicates the operational process for GLAO.
