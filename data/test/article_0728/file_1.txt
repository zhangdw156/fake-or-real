This session provided an overview of Adaptive Optics (AO) simulations for the Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), presented by Miska Le Louarn, and a talk by Gavin Dalton on optical and near-infrared (NIR) imaging detectors, focusing on future technology that could impact wide-field imaging with Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs). Le Louarn specifically discussed the results of simulations for Ground Layer Adaptive Optics (GLAO). The aim of GLAO is to enhance image clarity over a "wide" field of view (FoV) rather than achieving the diffraction limit, by adjusting for average atmospheric disturbances from multiple natural and/or laser guide stars. Here, "wide" field means areas of 5 to 7 arcminutes. K-band simulations indicate a potential 50% improvement in image quality compared to natural seeing when using three natural guide stars (NGS). The requirement for three NGSs and limitations on their brightness restrict sky coverage to around 50%, although this could improve with more efficient systems and fainter stars. Using three laser guide stars could expand sky coverage, but would increase the operational demands on GLAO.
