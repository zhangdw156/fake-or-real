The European Large Telescope (ELT) has a planned "Phase II" that requires funding but some key components can be proposed if money becomes available later on .
The project prioritizes four main areas within this phase:
LTAO Module: Essential component that maximizes HARMONI's capabilities
Inner Rings: Increase telescope collecting area by about 26, boosting sensitivity reducing observation times
Second Pre-Focal Station: Needed due its role supporting four future instruments (and beyond) - this adds another layer complexity cost benefit analysis will need careful consideration during decision making process
Why prioritize these elements?
These elements must be implemented early because they directly affect telescope operation:
Completing all seven sectors (segments) before first light drastically reduces operational complexities associated with maintaining them throughout its lifespan - it allows easier scheduling cleaning routines leading down costs over time
It's important not only consider construction but also optimize scientific capabilities from day one!
Additional details regarding two other major projects within Phase II include:
MOSAIC HIRES Development: Study completion expected by late yearearly next year (the same year as Phases A studies) allowing us better understand how best move forward with both projects effectively - especially concerning their shared reliance on a specific pre-focal station component
And finally we must remember about supporting system requirements such as power conditioning ensuring stable grid connection , weather data acquisition optimization scheduling observations based on weather patterns , mirror reflectivity maintenance over long term operation.. These aspects aim at minimizing downtime necessary throughout entire telescope lifespan
