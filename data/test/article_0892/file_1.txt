Our sample of quasar pairs is suitable for examining how gas is distributed in relation to the metal absorption found in quasar spectra. We selected 139 C iv systems after identification, spread over a redshift path of dz = 38, resulting in a density of 3.7 systems for every unit of redshift. We used the Nearest-Neighbour method on the list of C iv systems. We did not find any statistically significant signs of correlation in the transverse direction. This supports models suggesting that, at redshift z ~ 3, the longitudinal C iv correlation function aligns with a model where C iv exists in bubbles of approximately 2 Mpc comoving radius surrounding halos with a mass of about 10^12 MA. At this redshift, this results in a separation of roughly 2 arcminutes, which is smaller than the median separation found in our sample. However, there is some indication of clustering in C iv systems at distances shorter than 5,000 km s–1. This distance exceeds the typical correlation length of about 1,000 km s–1 noted in the longitudinal correlation function of C iv systems. This is caused by a higher number of associations within the velocity range of ∆v ~ 4,000 km s–1. Notably, these C iv associations are grouped in the specific area involving the quartet Q 0103-294A&B, Q 0102-2931, and Q 0102-293, all of which are less than 10 arcminutes apart. In these areas, the density of C iv systems is 6.4 per unit of redshift, and the number of coincidences within 4,000 km s–1 is about twice the average density of such coincidences in the overall sample. Additionally, there are no C iv systems between z = 1.955 and 2.051, a range where H i absorption in front of the quartet is significantly reduced. It is important to note that the correlation between the Lyman-alpha forests of Q 0102-2931 and Q 0103-294B, two quasars in the group separated by approximately 6 arcminutes, is found to be quite strong (x = 0.011). A similar excess of C iv systems has been observed in the field of Tol 1037–2704, which has been interpreted as evidence of a supercluster. This supercluster would extend at least 80 and 30 h –1 Mpc along and perpendicular to the line of sight, respectively. To our knowledge, no deep imaging has been conducted in these areas, and it would be beneficial to search for potential concentrations of galaxies.
