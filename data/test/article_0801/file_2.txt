The IFU subsystem has optics that capture the output beams from 24 pickoffs and reimages them with necessary anamorphic magnification onto the image slicers. This distortion creates square spatial sampling pixels ("spaxels") in order to ensure proper Nyquist sampling on the detector spectrally. The slices from sets of 8 subfields are properly aligned and combined into a single slit for each of the three spectrometers. The optical design is based on the Advanced Image Slicer concept and builds on experience from constructing the GNIRS integral-field unit for Gemini South. The fore-optics use three off-axis aspheres allowing for a manufacturing method of diamond-turning to enhance the surface roughness as opposed to raster fly-cutting. When designing the 24 optical trains, manufacturability was a key factor in optimizing the process along with a preference for using single-piece optical components wherever possible. Current design incorporates all spherical slicer mirrors and pupil mirrors with the same radius of curvature. The slit mirrors are toroidal, featuring consistent curvature in the spectral direction but different curvatures in the spatial direction. This design is well-suited for the available machining techniques. Each IFU sub-module creates a 254 mm long slit that contains 112 individual slices from 8 subfields. The mechanical design for one pickoff and IFU sub-module, which houses eight pickoff arms and eight integral field channels, highlights the three-fold symmetry of the KMOS system and the mechanical advantages of clustering common components on one plane.
