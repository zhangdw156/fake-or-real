The IFU subsystem has optics that capture the output beams from 24 pickoffs and reimages them with the right stretch onto image slicers. This stretching is necessary to ensure that the pixels (or "spaxels") on the sky are square while keeping proper sampling on the detector for different wavelengths. Groups of 8 subfields are aligned and combined into a single slit for each of the three spectrometers. The design is based on the Advanced Image Slicer concept and benefits from the experience gained from building the GNIRS integral-field unit for Gemini South. To improve surface quality, three off-axis aspheres are used in the front optics, made using diamond-turning instead of raster fly-cutting. Key design considerations for the 24 optical paths included manufacturability and using single-piece optical components when possible. In the current design, all slicer mirrors are spherical with identical curvature, as are the pupil mirrors. The slit mirrors are toroidal, sharing the same curvature in the spectral direction but differing in the spatial direction. This choice aligns well with available machining techniques. Each IFU sub-module generates a 254 mm long slit that contains 112 slices from 8 subfields. The mechanical design of a single pickoff and IFU sub-module, which has eight pickoff arms and eight field channels, highlights the three-fold symmetry of the KMOS system and the mechanical benefits of placing common components in one plane.
