This study uses data from various telescopes including ALMA to investigate how active galactic nuclei (AGN) affect their surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). They focus on quasars with redshifts higher than six point five (z6). By observing different types molecules within these quasars' ISM - particularly carbon monoxide (CO) - they were able identify its presence across multiple AGN samples but note some variations between them:
Carbon monoxide: They found carbon monoxide emissions throughout most AGN samples but not one specific sample called J11200641 which had no detection . The carbon monoxide emissions were stronger compared to other molecules like carbon ions ([CI]).
Carbon Ion Ratio: They observed strong evidence for both carbon dioxide ([CO]) as well as carbon ion ([CI]) emissions across most AGN samples studied.. The abundance ratios between these molecules varied significantly depending on specific AGN sample studied .
These findings suggest that while there might be some contribution from accretion onto central supermassive black holes due their high energy outputs ,the dominant source heating up this interstellar material appears likely related with star formation activity within those distant galaxy systems . Their investigation provides insights into how active galactic nuclei influence their surrounding environments during early universe galaxy formation processes . Further research using additional far infrared spectral lines will provide deeper understanding about metallicity levels within those distant galaxy systems being formed during early universe epoch .
