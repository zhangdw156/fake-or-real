GEBURTS magic trick! We used advanced instruments like ALMA (and others!) to study how much "dust" exists within some extremely distant (z magic number) active galactic nuclei (AGN). By looking at specific typesfrequencies this dust emits light as well as other materials such as carbon monoxide (CO). We found that despite their incredible age these objects have large amounts (up wards toward trillions!) of "magic dust" - which has implications about their growth over time! Finally because this "magic dust" also interacts with sources like stars it allows us better understand how they form new stars near them too! This opens doors for future investigations into what makes up those really far away but amazing active galactic nuclei!
