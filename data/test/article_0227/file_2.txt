This study estimates how many ionizing photons reach individual gas columns (pillars) based on assumptions about what type(s) of stellar populations contribute radiation pressure feedback within specific galaxies (e..g., NGC 3603). They use specific theoretical models based on existing research on stellar populations (OB type) within these galaxies; they also consider how far away they are from potential ionizing sources like hot young stellar objects (O type).
To calculate how much radiation pressure impact reaches individual gas columns (pillars), researchers first estimate how many ionizing photons come from nearby hot young stellar objects based on population studies using existing data sets related specifically to those galaxies . This includes accounting for factors like distance between source locations and sizesshapes around those column structures . They then adjust calculations based on whether there's only one large cluster or multiple smaller ones influencing different columns throughout different regions studied .
For example , some calculations account for light coming directly towards certain columns due proximity with known clusters while others take into account contributions more broadly spread out over larger areas because there may not always have been direct interaction between nearby hot young stellar objects .
Finally , it involves calculating scales that relate light intensity at column tip locations compared against actual magnitudes observed by telescopes such as Hubble Space Telescope across various wavelengths - including ultraviolet light - used by astronomers when studying interstellar medium interactions across cosmic timescales .
