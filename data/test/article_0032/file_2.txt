MLLoader's initial testing phase at both sites saw multiple tests involving fourteen separate missions under leadership from IPAG while receiving support from ESO for its development.. The initial test phase focused primarily upon verifying functionality between Naomy (the new addition) along side existing equipment such as Gravity at Mount IAC as well as other components like MIDIRSpeX (Mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Experiment) . This testing involved checking how Naomy performed alongside existing equipment like PIONIER Gravitiy . These tests aimed at assessing overall functionality through various metrics like throughput loss rates due t o filters etc.. Additionally they evaluated how well Naomy corrected for wobble within images taken through different parts or angles The results showed some minor flaws but overall confirmed that it functioned properly despite these imperfections.. After this initial assessment period concluded ,the entire setup returned back into active scientific use later that month.. Following this completion ,the teams continued monitoring its progress closely throughout all subsequent observations conducted . A second round off testing commenced later down line focusing more specifically upon how Naomy enhanced performance across various aspects related t o faint stars within specific observing conditions... This included evaluating its ability enhance signal strength relative t o noise levels across multiple instruments while also reducing losses incurred when trying track fringes .. Overall results indicated that Naomy is far more reliable against atmospheric changes compared tot he older system called STRAP...
