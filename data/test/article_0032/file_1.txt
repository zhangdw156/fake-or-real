The "NAomi" project underwent two phases for testing its capabilities at both ESO's Paranal Observatory (the first) and later at Garching (the second). These phases involved fourteen missions using various telescopes within an instrument suite called "VLTI".
During these tests:
Functionality checks verified that "NAomi" could work correctly as part of other telescopes like GRAVITY PIONIER under specific configurations like those offered by MATISSE .
Performance assessments measured throughput efficiency , potential signal loss due to dark areas or dust clouds , as well as stability through fringe tracking analysis . These measurements compared favorably against results obtained without "NAomi."
The initial phase concluded successfully after a month dedicated solely testing and operational readiness . Following this initial success , problems arising during testing prompted further investigation via remote access facilities before continuing operations at Paranal Observatory.. The second phase focused specifically upon improving image quality for faint stars when observing under less favorable weather conditions or when viewing through optical elements like fiber optics or filters used within interferometers such as those found within VLTI .
This improvement resulted from enhanced sensitivity across different wavelengths thanks primarily due to improvements made possible because it now operates alongside other tools like GRAVITY PIONIER but also because it can handle atmospheric fluctuations better than previous systems such as STRAP . This final assessment is documented in Woillez et al.(2019)
