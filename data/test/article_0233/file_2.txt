These studies have significantly advanced our knowledge about kilonovae by:
Pinpointing their polarization origins.
Predicting how polarization changes depending on observer position. This helps plan future observations effectively.
Developing methods for separating intrinsic signals from interstellar interference. This allows us to study early stages without confusion due external factors.
We also were able:
Determine AT 2017gfo's system inclination. This provides valuable information about its structure.
Future observations using instruments like LIGO Virgo promise even more discoveries as they can detect additional kilonovae for detailed analysis through polarization measurements which will help us understand their composition better including identifying specific elements present within them based on their color variations . This research lays groundwork for further exploration into these fascinating celestial events with high precision measurements thanks to reliable equipment constantly being upgraded .
