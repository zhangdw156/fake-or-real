Imagers and spectrographs are the primary tools used by optical astronomers. In general, astronomical observations begin with imaging surveys to identify interesting targets, and later transition to spectrographic observations to examine the physical and dynamic properties of these selected objects. Modern detectors have great throughput and large sizes, allowing significant portions of the sky to be deeply surveyed with imagers. However, spectral follow-up remains tedious because of the limited number of observations (multiplexing) that can be done at once. Advances in multi-object spectrographs, like VIMOS at VLT or DEIMOS at Keck, have improved the situation to some extent. Still, the number of sources identified in a typical imaging surveyfar exceeds what can be analyzed via spectroscopy. Therefore, it is necessary to select sources. Typically, this selection is made based on various multi-color images to capture specific spectral characteristics of the target population being studied. This process consumes more telescope time since multiple exposures are required for each location in the sky. Additionally, the selection is not completely precise, meaning some intended targets may be misidentified, resulting in wasted time during follow-up spectroscopy. However, the main drawback of this approach is the pre-selection of targeted objects, which biases the spectrographic observations and significantly restricts discovery opportunities.
