Imagers and spectrographs are the primary tools used by optical astronomers. Typically, astronomical studies begin with imaging surveys to identify interesting targets, followed by spectrographic observations to analyze the physical or dynamic properties of those objects. Modern detectors allow for extensive sky surveys using imagers because of their high sensitivity and large format. However, the follow-up spectroscopic work is still very time-consuming due to limited multiplex capabilities. The introduction of large multi-object spectrographs like VIMOS at VLT and DEIMOS at Keck has improved this situation somewhat. Yet, the number of sources found in a standard imaging survey far exceeds what can be analyzed with spectroscopy. Therefore, selecting which sources to observe is essential. Generally, this selection is based on a set of multi-color images to identify the desired spectral features of the objects being studied. This process requires significant telescope time since multiple exposures are needed for each location in the sky. Additionally, the selection process is never completely accurate, resulting in lost time during follow-up spectroscopy due to misidentifications. The main drawback of this method is not its relatively low efficiency but the initial target selection, which creates biases in spectrographic observations and significantly restricts new discoveries.
