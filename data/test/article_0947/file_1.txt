There are several noticeable peaks in the histogram of galaxy redshifts in the GOODS-S field. One of the highest redshift peaks, at z = 1.6, was discussed in an earlier study. Within this large-scale concentration, a peak was identified that may develop into a galaxy cluster, although evidence at z = 1.6 suggests this structure is probably not fully relaxed. Since this peak is within our observation area, GMASS included 32 galaxies with confirmed z = 1.6 redshifts to the ten already known. We confirm a significant, narrow peak in the distribution of spectroscopic redshifts at z = 1.610, creating an overdensity in redshift space by a factor of six. The velocity dispersion for these 42 galaxies is 450 km/s, which is expected to rise with redshift to match that of a galaxy cluster. The redshift distribution is not Gaussian but is bimodal, featuring a primary peak at z = 1.610 and a secondary peak at z = 1.602. While we do not observe significant spatial separation between these peaks, it may suggest the structure is not yet fully relaxed. In the northern part of the GMASS field, the density of spike galaxies is five times greater than in the rest of the field. The spike galaxies in this high-density area have different properties compared to those outside: they have higher mean age and mass, but lower mean star formation rates and specific star formation rates. Six of the eight passive galaxies in this spike are located in this area, with three forming a subgroup smaller than 90 kpc. This group of passive galaxies is not situated at the peak density of spike galaxies but rather about 800 kpc away. The available NIR imaging enables a color-magnitude diagram of the galaxies with confirmed redshifts using the J-K color, which encompasses the 4000 Ã… break at this redshift. We observe a red sequence that aligns with a theoretical sequence of galaxies that underwent a short burst of star formation at z = 3. This is the first known structure of this type; its redshift exceeds that of any known galaxy cluster, and it consists of spectroscopically confirmed, red, early-type galaxies. Its irregular nature in angular and redshift space, including at least two localized higher density peaks, indicates the structure is still in the process of relaxing, consistent with its low X-ray emission. Since this structure displays some characteristics typical of clusters, it may serve as a precursor to a galaxy cluster as it forms.
