China is working on building an advanced telescope called 'GRavity' that can precisely measure tiny movements in stars using its unique design that combines two different measurement systems (a 'fringe tracker' and a 'science channel'). This allows them to remove most sources causing error but they need more precise data about how light travels through space (the 'optical path delay') which is influenced by our atmosphere which causes some blurring over short periods (a few minutes). To get their target level Chinese scientists are aiming at detecting very small changes caused by orbiting planets or even potential habitable worlds like our own earth! They have already made progress using their current technology on nearby stars like "GJ65AB" where they have been able to identify subtle shifts caused by orbiting objects - this could give us valuable information about exoplanet formation or even help us understand how our own solar system formed! However they need further development regarding their measurements so they can reach their ultimate goal China aims for - detecting small red dwarf planet systems close enough for observation .
