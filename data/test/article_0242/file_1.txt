GRAVITY's unique design allows precise measurement using interferometry (measuring tiny changes in light). This technique significantly reduces errors caused by various factors but relies on accurate measurement from its own metrology system for precision corrections based on how light travels through it over time (the differential optical path delay). However this precision is limited by atmospheric fluctuations that cause slight shifts over time; these can only be reduced significantly with better technology or models that better account for these fluctuations affecting our measurements at high levels like those needed for detecting tiny planetary movements around stars like GJ 65 AB - which has been studied extensively as it has very small orbits around each other at close distances are useful targets because they are relatively close enough so we can observe them with current technology while having enough size differences so their motions can be measured accurately even if there are some limitations in our current technology . Using data gathered over several months from both AT array instruments at different times showed significant improvements compared to previous observations making this observation method more accurate than ever before! Future observations could lead us further into discovering exoplanets similar in size and mass as Earth orbiting nearby stars like GJ 65 AB . However achieving true accuracy down to ten microarcsecond level would require further development especially when dealing with complex systems where many factors could affect our results including models used during analysis or potential biases introduced during data collection methods themselves , all requiring careful consideration when interpreting results obtained using this novel technique
