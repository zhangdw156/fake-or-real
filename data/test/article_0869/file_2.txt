The vegetation belts consist of plant groups that are suited to specific conditions of climate and soil type. A recent survey in the ALMA area, including Sairecabur, Toco Toco, and Miñiques, has outlined these vegetation types. On the western slopes of Toco Toco, all belts are present because the ancient rocks have transformed into sand and clay, allowing water retention. At the lowest elevation of 2,900–3,350 m, limited rainfall, high evaporation, and salt and nitrate in the soil are key challenges. Atriplex communities, which are tall greyish bushes, thrive near the Atacama Salar in salt-laden soils. In untouched rocky areas, the cactus Maihueniopsis camachoi grows in clusters, alongside other plants. In sheltered areas, the tall cactus Trichocereus atacamensis, which comes from Argentina, can be found. At higher elevations, evaporation dominates, with evaporation rates increasing with wind speed. Low humidity and high winds lead to significant water loss from plant surfaces, prompting plants to develop various strategies to minimize this loss. In the second vegetation zone, from 3,350 to 3,850 m, Fabiana bryoides has small rosette leaves that form a dense cover on the stem, resembling coral. Fabiana denudata takes this further by having almost no leaves, with photosynthesis occurring on the upper surface of the stem, which is covered in a thick resin. Some plants, like certain Senecios, reduce water loss with a white layer of dense hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce wind speed near the surface. In the 3,850–4,300 m zone, vegetation is sparse, dominated by graminaceous herbs, with Festuca chrysophylla giving the area a distinctive golden color. In sheltered spots behind the tufts of Festuca, various plant species can grow, including Parastrephia quadrangularis, which has scale-like leaves covering the stem. The combination of Festuca, Parastrephia, and Baccharis creates preferred grazing areas for guanacos and vicuñas.
