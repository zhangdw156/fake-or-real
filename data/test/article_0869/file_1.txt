Vegetation belts consist of plant groups suited for specific ranges of climate conditions, soil types, and textures. A recent study maps the vegetation in the ALMA area at locations like Sairecabur, Toco Toco, and Miñiques. The western slopes of Toco Toco host a complete range of these belts because the ancient rocks have weathered into sand and clay that can hold water. At altitudes between 2,900 and 3,350 meters, limited precipitation, high evaporation rates, and salt and nitrate-rich soil create challenges for vegetation. Tall greyish shrubs, known as Atriplex, grow along the shoreline of the salt-laden Atacama Salar. On rocky sites that have not been disturbed, colonies of the cactus species Maihueniopsis camachoi form spiky pillows. In sheltered spots from the wind, the tall cactus Trichocereus atacamensis, an invasive species from Argentina, thrives. As elevations rise, evaporation plays a greater role, leading to increased water loss from plants, especially at high wind speeds and low humidity. Plants have developed various adaptations to minimize water loss. In the second vegetation zone, at 3,350–3,850 m, Fabiana bryoides has tiny leaves that form a concentrated cover on the stem, resembling coral. Fabiana denudata epitomizes extreme adaptation, having suppressed leaves that allow photosynthesis at its upper stem surface, with its entire plant covered in a thick resin. Some other plants, such as various Senecios, reduce water loss by developing a dense layer of white hairs that reflect sunlight and help slow wind at their surface. Between 3,850 and 4,300 m, plant growth diminishes and grasses become predominantly present. The golden grass Festuca chrysophylla particularly colors the landscape. Other plant species can thrive in the shelter provided by the Festuca clumps. Another key species, Parastrephia quadrangularis, features scaly leaves that overlap like tiles. The combination of Festuca, Parastrephia, and Baccharis serves as preferred grazing for guanacos and vicuñas.
