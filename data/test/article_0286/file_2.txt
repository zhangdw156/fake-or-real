Here's how you can break down those royal requirements into simpler language:
Royalties - Transient Surveys
TiDES SN: They need quick turnarounds! To find new star explosions quickly enough (like within four days), they also need advance notice about where they're looking (at least seven days beforehand). This helps them pick out targets within specific areas where they want them found quickly! They plan on finding as many as possible - around thirty thousand! That gives them tonsa data ready right away so they can train their machines like photometers or statisticians learn how things work! Finally it helps build up huge datasets perfect for learning about rare events too!.
Royalties - Host Galaxy Surveys
TiDES Hosts: When RoyalTY finds new supernovae (SNe), this new system needs royal permission royal permission royal permissionroyaltyroyaltyroyaltyroyalty royalRoyaltyRoyalty RoyalityRoyalty RoyalityRoyalty Royality ROYALTYROYALTY royale royally royalty royal royally ROYALTYROYALTY ROYALTYROYALTY ROYALITYROYALITY ROYALITY ROYALTYROYALTY ROYALITY ROYALTY ROYALTY ROYALLY
