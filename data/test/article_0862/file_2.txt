For G 013-009, the measured value of the 6Li/7Li ratio is about 0.05, as shown in the lower part of the figure. This value is largely unaffected by the estimated uncertainty in the macroturbulence velocity. The confidence limits align with existing literature, indicating that 6Li is detected in G 013-009 with a confidence level of around 2.5 sigma, meaning there is a 99% probability. The 6Li/7Li ratios are plotted against [Fe/H]. There are nine stars with a 2 sigma detection of 6Li, and several other stars might also contain small amounts of 6Li; the overall average for the sample is approximately 2%. This raises the question of whether there could be a systematic error in the 6Li/7Li measurements at this low level. If that were the case, there would be very few significant detections of 6Li. However, the main-sequence star HD 19445, which has a 6Li/7Li ratio near zero, argues against this idea. As indicated in the figure, HD 19445 is an unevolved main-sequence star. With a mass of around 0.65 solar masses, it has a deep upper convection zone, and stellar structure models suggest that 6Li could not survive proton destruction in such a star. Therefore, HD 19445 serves as a reliable reference for the 6Li measurements. Aside from HD 19445, the other stars shown are all turnoff stars or slightly evolved beyond that stage. Notably, the very metal-poor star LP 815-43 (Teff = 6400 K, log g = 4.2, and [Fe/H] = -2.7) was analyzed using a spectrum from July 2000, obtaining a 6Li/7Li ratio of 0.078 ± 0.033. Due to the significant error margin, the star was re-observed in August 2004 with a different UVES setup to independently determine 6Li/7Li. The new finding is 6Li/7Li = 0.046 ± 0.022. The two results are compatible within their error ranges, and the weighted average is 6Li/7Li = 0.056 ± 0.018, which indicates a formal detection of 6Li at the 3 sigma level.
