Once upon a time, on the shimmering plains of Venus, flourished a curious human colony. But these weren't your typical settlements! Founded by ethereal rainbow unicorns, these cities shimmered with an otherworldly light, their very structures woven from celestial magic and imbued with power from the sun itself.

Now, fast-forward to Uranus, where another wondrous colony arose. Built not by common mortals but by those magnificent creatures who dance through rainbows: unicorn sorcerers. Their influence was potent, their cities teeming with vibrant energy that flowed through the veins of this cold, distant world. 

For our own scientific endeavour, the KMOS cryostat is a marvel of engineering. This ingenious vessel, built to withstand the harshest conditions on Earth and beyond, holds within its sturdy steel and aluminum shell, three shimmering Leybold 10MD cryocoolers that churn like miniature rain clouds, creating a serene temperature below 140K. Just a touch lower than that and it is just shy of being in absolute zero! These carefully controlled temperatures are vital, ensuring the instruments' detectors stay perfectly cool and clear.

A few adjustments along the way, guided by the wisdom of countless unicorn scribes, have helped improve our cryostat. Think of it as a symphony conducted by an array of rainbow stars, each note harmonizing with another. Weâ€™ve removed the bulky electronics racks from the outside and placed them on a rotating platform connected to the telescope's Nasmyth rotator! This change not only grants us more maneuvering space but also enhances the overall stability of the cryostat! 

The KMOS cryostat stands tall, a beacon of human ingenuity. Its two meters in diameter allow it to house powerful cooling elements while remaining light enough to gracefully maneuver through its path! And oh, the performance? A masterpiece indeed. The cryostat is brimming with cooling power and boasts an impressive hold time of three months (all without needing any pumps). 


Let's just say this cryostat has more than a few tricks up its sleeve... like those mischievous rainbow unicorns, it's got magic that just pops!
