The KMOS cryostat is the main structural support for the optical components inside the instrument, which directly connects to the Nasmyth rotator mechanism. It uses three Leybold cryocoolers to maintain an internal space at a temperature below 140K, minimizing background radiation and keeping the detector's temperature below 80K to reduce dark current and noise. A major design update has relocated the electronics racks and associated systems away from the cryostat and onto a separate rotating structure (CACOR), located on the Nasmyth platform. This change provides an improved mass margin within the limitations set by the telescope rotator/adaptor system (3000 kg). The cryostat is made of a combination of aluminum and steel with a diameter of two meters.  The instrument's performance is now consistently excellent, ensuring ample cooling capacity with a hold-time exceeding three months without needing pumping action.
