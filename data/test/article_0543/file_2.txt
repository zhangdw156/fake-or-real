Galactic surveys, which focus on understanding the Milky Way galaxy's structure, are active research areas worldwide. The Australian AAO 2dF facility coordinates with the Gaia-ESO survey, sharing targets for observation and planning follow-up studies. AEGIS seeks out metal-poor stars, focusing on rarer but brighter stars found by SkyMapper, to improve statistical understanding of the Milky Way's structure as mapped by Gaia-ESO. The RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) is a large-scale survey that observes calcium triplet spectra of relatively bright stars with lower resolution. RAVE complements Gaia-ESO by providing independent kinematic data. Combining both surveys' kinematic samples will yield valuable insights. To maximize the benefits from existing and upcoming spectroscopy projects, such as RAVE and Gaia-ESO, efforts are underway to standardize abundance calibration methods across different datasets for a long-lasting legacy.
