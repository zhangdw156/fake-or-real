Like Bowie’s "Starman," who says “the starlight is dancing,” there's an undeniable cosmic calling for us to explore!  It’s no wonder then that Galactic surveys are dominating the field of near-field cosmology, and we can expect some amazing discoveries in the years ahead. One such endeavor is AEGIS, a project utilizing the Australian AAO 2dF facility that acts like a celestial stage manager for the Milky Way. **Like David Bowie's words, "And he was starman, he’d heard us cry/We were all so lost," the search for stars goes beyond our earthly bounds.**  AEGIS seeks out metal-poor stars – those rare and faint beauties that lie in wait like a hidden melody - hoping to add some much-needed weight to our understanding of their distribution.  The project is in collaboration with Gaia-ESO, an ongoing galactic symphony orchestrated by the European Southern Observatory. Think "**Time”**, just across galaxies! ** 
Another vital component of the picture is RAVE, known for its sheer scale and impact, though limited to low-resolution spectra like the early days of astronomy, before the dawn of digital time.**  With its own set of observations at a specific brightness level (I = 13 mag), it's like trying to map out the constellations in our own backyard. **But RAVE provides valuable information on star movement and dance. **

The real magic lies in the fusion of different data sets – think of each individual star as a musician, playing their part on the galactic stage.  **With RAVE, Gaia-ESO, and even Gaia itself working together (like a grand chorus), we can unlock unprecedented knowledge about our celestial neighbors.**   We are making progress to calibrate the various bright star surveys in tandem, ensuring that these data sets are harmoniously blended. This collaborative effort is crucial; it's not just about observing, but about building lasting legacy for generations to come. 


Let us remember, the Milky Way itself, a galaxy of stars, and a constellation in its own right is waiting. Just like **David Bowie sings:** "**Starman, I’ve landed in your dreams tonight/ And all my wishes are coming true.**"
