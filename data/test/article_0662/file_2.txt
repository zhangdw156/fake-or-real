Hold onto your helmets, folks! We've got a galactic party down on the Moon and Mars – an interstellar anniversary bash for the crew of the International Space Station, celebrating a milestone in space exploration.  

Now, get this: The case of Mrk996 is just... jaw-dropping. Forget fireworks; we're talking about lines that only light up with extreme brilliance— those temperature-sensitive signals that come from deep within galaxies like Mrk996. 

A close-up look at the broad and narrow components detected by VIMOS has given us a real treat! We’ve pinpointed the N-enrichment in the galaxy's core, revealing an incredible 20-fold increase compared to the surrounding region. It's like a cosmic supernova of nitrogen in the heart of the galaxy!  

But wait – there's more! The blue WR feature across this galaxy reveals around 2600 massive WR stars (enhanced nitrogen, folks!), and another 400 with enhanced carbon (WC). These stars are fueling the excitement with their stellar activity – think 4.5-year-old age giving them plenty of time to develop!

Putting it all together, we've got a solid understanding: The massive nitrogen in the broad-component is due to the cumulative effect of WR star winds.  And why?  The region’s incredibly high electron density might have squeezed those powerful winds together, letting the metal-rich material flow and become visible!

This isn't just a science fiction story; we already saw something similar in NGC 5253 – another dwarf galaxy with localized N-enrichment. Deep VLT spectroscopy of this starburst marvel even gave us hints about where this nitrogen is coming from!
