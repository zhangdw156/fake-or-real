Mrk996's case was unusual because some emissions lines could only be detected as a broader form; these were temperature-sensitive lines showing light from the core of the galaxy. A study using VIMOS helped separate nitrogen enrichment, which had been previously observed in the broad component only.  Nitrogen levels here were 20 times higher than in the surrounding narrow component. All other elements did not show such a significant difference between these components. Observations indicate that approximately 2600 N-enriched WR stars and 400 WR-type stars with enhanced carbon (WC) are found within the turbulent nucleus of the galaxy.  The Hb equivalent width suggests an age of 4.5 Myr in this region, old enough for massive stars to evolve into WR stars. Combining all these details supports the conclusion that nitrogen overabundance in the broad component stems from WR star-powered N-enriched winds, and this high N content material is spatially close to regions with a high density of electrons which may have contributed to its mixing with the cooler phases and subsequent visibility. Only one other dwarf starburst galaxy with localized nitrogen enrichment has been reported so far: NGC 5253, where a similar phenomenon was seen in the central starburst regions,  including an isolated increase in N/O ratio within one specific region.
