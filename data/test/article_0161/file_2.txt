This research examined how many astronomy research articles published between January 2010 and July 2017 were freely available through online repositories like arXiv compared to traditional publications channels like journals or databases hosted by organizations like ESO (European Southern Observatory). Results showed a steady increase over time - from about two thirds being accessible online initially up to nearly all articles becoming available by late in this period â€“ though some variation could occur if full data was still not collected for every year within this period . This study found those articles shared via arXiv received significantly more citations than those not shared publicly online suggesting greater visibility contributed towards higher citation rates . While its difficult definitively link these increased citation rates solely to public accessibility due to limited sample size , this research highlights how making scientific work readily accessible via platforms like arxiv can boost its impact within academia . Overall , researchers concluded open access publishing initiatives benefit astronomy communities by making important findings easily discoverable across disciplines .
