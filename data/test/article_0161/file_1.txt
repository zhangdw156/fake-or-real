rzecz jasna , this study looked at how many astronomy research articles were publicly available online from January of starters . It found out that more than half - nearly nine out ten - of those articles had been uploaded ontoarXiv , which makes them easily accessible . However , they also discovered why some research was not put up online . Some researchers simply didn't have enough time due to busy schedules .
The study also found out if putting research online led it being cited more often than those who didn't upload it . They found there was indeed a big difference between how many times articles uploaded online get cited compared with those who werent uploaded.. This suggests putting your work online can help make it known by others within your field
Overall , they concluded sharing scientific knowledge openly has great benefits including making information readily available for everyone within astronomy community .
