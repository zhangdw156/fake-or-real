Galaxies in groups can be influenced by processes such as ram pressure stripping, interactions, harassment, mergers, group tidal forces, gas loss, and reduced star formation, also referred to as strangulation or suffocation. Mergers are particularly significant since galaxies in groups have lower relative speeds compared to those in clusters. Simulations indicate that mergers lead to a rapid and intense spike in star formation lasting about a hundred million years before the galaxies combine into a spheroid, which then evolves passively. Mergers also transfer momentum from the interacting galaxies to the entire group, increasing the group's velocity dispersion. Observations confirm that groups with higher velocity dispersion have more spheroids. In the end, feedback from leftover black holes and active galactic nuclei (AGN) can decrease star formation by a factor of ten or more. At least 50% of galaxies in compact groups are low-luminosity AGNs, compared to 30% in the field. Additionally, the cores of X-ray groups are often disturbed, providing further evidence for AGN feedback. The selective reduction of star formation in larger group members may account for the downsizing phenomenon, which is the observed decline in the maximum brightness of star-forming galaxies at lower redshifts. Mergers primarily occur at redshifts greater than 1; for instance, at z = 2.5, about 50% of bright galaxies are merging, while only 2% of galaxies merge each billion years today. Most stars in group members formed between redshifts 2.5 and 1. Locally, environmental effects can be observed by reconstructing the star formation histories of individual galaxies. For example, the proportion of intermediate-age stars in Milky Way dwarf satellites varies with their distance from the Galaxy, while this proportion remains constant in M81 satellites, likely due to the compact nature of the M81 group, where frequent close encounters have standardized their star formation histories.
