Galaxies in groups can be influenced by processes such as ram pressure stripping, interactions, harassment, mergers, group tidal forces, gas loss, and long-term reductions in star formation (known as strangulation or suffocation). Mergers are the most significant factor because galaxies within groups move more slowly relative to one another than those in clusters. Simulations demonstrate that mergers lead to a sudden burst of star formation that lasts about a hundred million years before the galaxies merge into a spheroid, which then evolves passively. Additionally, these mergers transfer momentum between the interacting galaxies and the entire group, increasing the overall velocity dispersion of the group. Observations confirm that groups with higher velocity dispersion contain more spheroid galaxies. Eventually, the effects from the central black hole and active galactic nucleus (AGN) decrease star formation by tenfold or more. At least 50% of galaxies in compact groups are low-luminosity AGNs, compared to only 30% in broader areas. Furthermore, the centers of X-ray groups often show disturbances, suggesting AGN feedback might be at play. The selective reduction of star formation in larger group members could account for the downsizing phenomenon, which refers to the reduction in the maximum luminosity of star-forming galaxies at lower redshifts. Mergers predominantly occur at redshifts greater than 1; for instance, at z=2.5, about 50% of bright galaxies merge, while today only about 2% merge per gigayear. Most stars in group members formed between redshifts z=2.5 and 1. Locally, environmental impacts on individual galaxies can be traced by reconstructing their star-formation histories. For example, the presence of middling-age stars among Milky Way dwarf satellites varies with their distance from the Galaxy. In contrast, the same fraction remains constant in the satellites of M81, likely due to the group's compactness, which has led to frequent close encounters that have unified their star-formation histories.
