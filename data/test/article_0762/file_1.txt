Centaurus A is important in the study of galaxies outside our own because it is the nearest large elliptical galaxy, the closest galaxy merger, and the nearest active galactic nucleus (AGN), located just 3.8 megaparsecs away. In terms of distance, one parsec is equivalent to 53 milliarcseconds. The radio emissions from Centaurus A can be studied across a wide range of angular scales, from its very small jets observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) to larger lobes seen over several degrees. The presence of dust in the merging spiral galaxy obscures the view of Centaurus A's center, making infrared observations essential. In 2005, Centaurus A was observed using the MIDI instrument with two combinations of telescopes: UT3–UT4 and UT2–UT3. These combinations provided two visibility measurements taken about two hours apart. The angle of the baseline for UT3–UT4 was roughly perpendicular to the radio jet observed at the parsec scale, while UT2–UT3 was aligned with the jet. The observations revealed that mid-infrared emissions are slightly resolved perpendicular to the jet with a baseline of 60 meters, but not along the jet itself. This indicates that the core's emission in the 8 to 13 µm range comes primarily from an unresolved point source (full width at half maximum less than 6 milliarcseconds), contributing 50% to 80% of the total flux at 13 µm and 8 µm. A minor extended component (with a size of roughly 30 milliarcseconds) was also identified, appearing elongated perpendicular to the radio axis. However, additional observations with improved coverage and longer baselines are needed to better determine its size and orientation. We suggest this extended component is due to dust emission from a small, tilted disc with a diameter of about 0.6 parsecs. The unresolved part is likely the non-thermal 'synchrotron core' of Centaurus A, as its flux and spectrum match the extrapolated power-law spectrum observed at millimeter wavelengths after accounting for foreground extinction. When combined with photometry at shorter wavelengths, the flux of the unresolved point source aligns with a standard synchrotron spectrum characterized by a flat power-law. We interpret this 'synchrotron core' as the base of the radio jet. Our study of Centaurus A indicates that mid-infrared radiation processes include more than just thermal dust emissions. The thermal dust emission from Centaurus A is very low, over 20 times weaker than that of the Circinus galaxy, likely due to insufficient dust in the inner parsec and a lack of a strong heating source. It is clear that Centaurus A does not have a torus blocking our view or a bright UV-optical central accretion disc. Most likely, the material accreting onto its black hole is through a flow that conserves energy poorly, resulting in little radiation output.
