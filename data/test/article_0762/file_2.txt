Centaurus A is important in the study of galaxies outside our own because it is the nearest large elliptical galaxy, the closest galaxy merger, and the nearest example of a violent superconducting black hole. It is located 3.8 Mpc away, where 1 parsec (pc) equals 53 milliarcseconds (mas). Radio emissions can be observed at varied angular scales, from the very tight VLBI jets (a few mas) to the large outer lobes (several degrees). Dust in the merging spiral galaxy obscures views of Centaurus A’s nucleus, making infrared observations essential. In 2005, middles-infrared observations were made with the MIDI instrument using two telescopes: UT3–UT4 and UT2–UT3, covering different time windows of about two hours. The arrangement between UT3–UT4 was roughly perpendicular to the radio jet angle, while UT2–UT3 lined up with it. Findings indicate mid-infrared emission is slightly resolved at 60-metres across, perpendicular to the jet but remains unresolved along it. Thus, the emission between 8 to 13 micrometers (µm) likely originates from a point source smaller than 6 mas, accounting for 50% to 80% of the total emissions at those wavelengths. The extended source is small (about 30 mas wide), appearing elongated in the direction opposite the radio axis. More detailed coverage and longer measurements could more accurately clarify this extended source's characteristics. This hazy segment might stem from dust in a small, tilted disc roughly 0.6 pc in size. The unresolved emissions are attributed to the non-thermal "synchrotron core" of Centaurus A based on flux levels and connections to previous satellite data. When combining this with additional observations at shorter frequencies, these emissions conform to expected synchrotron behavior seen in a fluidly resultant infall setup. Observations specify that color radiation methods in Centaurus A extend beyond conventional dust emission.
