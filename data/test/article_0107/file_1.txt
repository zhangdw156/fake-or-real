To study stars within densely packed clusters near their centers using powerful instruments like SINFONI and its K band grating for optimal clarity and resolution:
The researchers designed a mosaic image spanning multiple exposures covering large areas around these dense regions with different resolutions depending on their density levels. This allowed them to create detailed maps showing how these individual stars move relative to one another within these tight groupings over time as well as identify specific molecular bands associated with cooler giant stars while also capturing information about some warmer star populations through specific atomic lines present within those structures .
Instead of taking average light across all points within a cluster they focused on analyzing individual bright spots representing distinct stellar cores by extracting their unique spectral signatures directly from those exposed pixels which were specifically chosen based on where each core was located along with its brightness level according to an algorithm called MIKiS . Through this process they were able to observe hundreds or even dozens upon dozens massive cool giants down towards faintness levels around K 15 across many different dense clusters studied thus far .
