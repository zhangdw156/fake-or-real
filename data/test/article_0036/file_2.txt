Since its introduction during Period 80's call for proposals in October of the year of AMBER started using "Fringe Tracking" . This technique helps reduce blurry images caused by atmospheric turbulence , allowing astronomers to use longer exposure times on detectors leading to better image quality . They can observe fainter objects or increase their spectral resolution .
FINITO is software that performs this Fringe Tracking within VLTI , allowing it measure precise fluctuations affecting light waves over time . It works through Real Time Data Processing via Reflective Memory Network architecture before being combined with regular AMBER observations since period eighty three(April of year )
The combination has led to significant improvements such as better sensitivity due to improved polarization control using lithium niobate plates which enhance both observational efficiency as well as throughput through increased light collection capabilities
Over time , continuous upgrades have further enhanced both instruments leading towards shorter observation blocks while maintaining image quality across all resolutions..
