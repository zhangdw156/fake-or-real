The European Space Agency (ESA) should work hard to ensure that Gaia achieves its expected high performance in astrometry, photometry, and spectroscopy. Meeting these standards is crucial for the satellite to enhance our understanding of the Galaxy by revealing different stellar populations through chemistry and dynamics studies. The European Southern Observatory (ESO) should explore options for building new wide-field spectrographs or improving current instruments for medium to high-resolution spectroscopy of a large number of noteworthy stars identified by Gaia. This recommendation has two parts: 
1. Follow-up observations: Gaia will effectively select clear and unbiased samples of specific stellar populations. High-resolution spectroscopy will yield detailed chemical abundances for different star groups.
2. Complementary observations: Medium-resolution spectroscopy will deliver radial velocities and metallicities for stars fainter than V ≥ 16.5 that are not measured by Gaia’s Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS).
