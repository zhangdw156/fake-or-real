As part of our analysis of ALMA data from low-energy starbursts (LESS SMGs), we used observation frequency to search for emission lines in the data cubes. In two specific LESS SMGs (aLESS61.1 and aLESS65.1), we detected the [C ii] 157.4 μm emission line, indicating redshifts of 4.419 and 4.445, respectively. These SMGs are very faint in other wavelengths, with radio (1.4 GHz) upper limits below 25 mJy and being blank on the Herschel maps at 250, 350, and 500 μm. Thus, they are called "870 μm peakers". Based solely on two sources, the blind detection rate of [C ii] within the 7.5 GHz (Δz = 0.12) ALMA bandpass aligns with previously-determined photometric redshift distribution for SMGs and suggests a modest portion (< 25%) of high-redshift SMGs are chosen by this method. Because [C ii] is the dominant cooling line within the interstellar medium, its detection gives us insight into the properties of the interstellar medium in these galaxies. In local luminous-infrared galaxies, the ratio of L[C ii] /L_FIR is constant at approximately 1% but decreases to < 0.1% in local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). However, [C ii] detections within high-redshift ULIRGs and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have shown that this emission can be as bright as in low-luminosity galaxies, which is attributed to lower ionisation fields resulting from more widespread star formation activity within these systems compared to compact nuclear star formation found in low-redshift ULIRGs. Our ALMA observations reveal a much higher ratio of L[C ii] /L_FIR in these SMGs compared to similar far-infrared luminous galaxies in the local universe, suggesting larger gas reservoirs exist in these high-redshift ULIRGs. In aLESS65.1, we observed [C ii] emission extending over more than 3 kpc scales.  Using our ALMA survey volume, we also explored the bright end of the [C ii] luminosity function, with observations spanning Δz = 0.12 at z = 4.4 (a co-moving volume of 2.9 × 10^5 Mpc^3). Finding two galaxies within this volume exhibiting strong [C ii] emission indicates a > 1000 times increase in the number density of luminous [C ii] emitters between redshift ~0 and 4.4. This corresponds to an estimated luminosity evolution of a factor ~ 3–4 times from z = 0 to 4.4, consistent with the evolution in the far-infrared luminosity function for the same redshift range.
