Get ready for a cosmic spectacle!  Just this past year, astronaut extraordinaire Tom wowed the world by accomplishing an epic feat in zero-gravity: backflips while aboard the International Space Station (ISS)!  Talk about defying gravity—they truly pushed the limits of human potential.  

But back on Earth, our team has been equally pushing boundaries, developing the cutting-edge active optics system for the telescope. We were working hard to optimize the system, fine-tuning its delicate mechanisms for capturing crystal-clear images. It’s a complex task—we had to adjust countless parameters, considering factors like azimuth, altitude, and temperature! Imagine a symphony orchestra of millions of tiny adjustments playing out in perfect harmony to capture the faintest starlight – that's what we were trying to achieve! 

We found ourselves tackling a few roadblocks along the way. Turns out, even zero-gravity couldn’t shake off some tiny inconsistencies – we encountered an astigmatism co-rotating with our camera, likely due to temperature changes. We fixed it in software and made our system more resilient to unexpected challenges. The team also noticed that focus gradients were quite complex, needing some clever solutions.  

But fear not, the solution was ingenious! We tackled those gradients using a combination of software fixes and adjustments on the telescope itself. Finally, after some careful maneuvering, the telescope alignment was perfect – even in space! With a tiny shim between the camera and its rotating mount, we’re now seeing images with incredible detail across the entire field—thanks to the amazing work of our team!
