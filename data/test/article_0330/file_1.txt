The initial planned observation period for MUSE NFM's scientific validation tests from August 7th - August 11th, was delayed due to technical issues with one laser system at Paranal Observatory's guiding facility facility . The observation schedule was moved back into early September, where it ran between September 5th - September August for approximately half nights due to limited availability . Due to stringent requirements regarding clear skies needed for accurate data analysis , only times when seeing conditions exceeded less than or equal too . This caused some delays as some programs couldnt complete their full allotted time; however , a total amount of data obtained over this period totaled twenty seven hours across fifteen program attempts . Of those attempts , five successfully completed while six received partial results ; two additional programs failed due lack off suitable natural guide stars while two others never began at all . All proposers received updates on their program outcomes by Septemeber the nineteenth .
