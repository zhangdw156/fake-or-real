With a structure in place to support the optics, we now turn to the influence of wind. Different assumptions about wind loads have been made, using open air as a standard. A VLT-like box-style enclosure offers limited wind protection and can even shift some wind pressure to higher frequencies, which is not ideal. A TMT-like dome design was also evaluated, as it better dampens wind effects by reducing the opening exposed to the wind and having a dome larger than strictly necessary for the telescope. In both cases, analysis for the 42-meter telescope shows that achieving good image quality in passive mode amid reasonable wind loads will be challenging without field stabilization. Specifically, the tip-tilt component of the wavefront due to strong winds is estimated to be around 0.8 arcseconds rms, regardless of the optical design. A smaller telescope with a larger dome could potentially lower this to below 0.2 arcseconds. However, since the telescope is meant to be adaptive, it will already include a tip-tilt capable mirror in its optical system. The challenge we face is managing a 0.8-arcsecond tip-tilt with a large (2.5- or 4.8-meter) mirror, where the edge of the mirror would need to move several hundred microns at frequencies of tens of Hz to achieve the required tilt. The Project Office has commissioned design studies from various industrial firms to find a solution to this issue, which are part of a broader effort to create conceptual designs for the adaptive optics system, whether for the Gregorian or five-mirror optical configurations. Two firms have proposed solutions for the 4.8-meter Gregorian mirror, which will achieve tip-tilt by segmenting the mirror's support structure and its front face, allowing for coordinated movement of up to 18 segments to achieve global tip-tilt. Although the specifics vary among suppliers, both designs share the same fundamental concept of a thin glass face supported by actuators on a support structure. For the five-mirror design, three options for the field stabilization stage were discussed with industry representatives. Since the fifth mirror is only 2.7 meters in size, segmentation is not considered necessary, and while some innovative ideas are under consideration, we believe this problem is manageable.
