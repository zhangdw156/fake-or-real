Our high-quality near-infrared (NIR) spectral library will be an important tool for astronomers and scientists.  It will be useful in planning research proposals and evaluating potential projects. The library's spectra are expected to be valuable for a wide range of scientific investigations in both astronomy and laboratory astrophysics, as it includes data that can be used to test atmospheric models, refine existing line lists, detect weak features in the spectrum of bright stars (such as exoplanets or discs), and much more. The library will be combined with UV spectra from satellites for comprehensive wavelength coverage, allowing scientists to explore a wider range of information. This new data could help develop alternative methods for studying the universe when high-resolution ultraviolet spectra become unavailable following the retirement of telescopes like STIS. As major future astronomical projects, like the James Webb Space Telescope and Extremely Large Telescope, will focus on the NIR, this library is expected to be widely used throughout the field of stellar astrophysics. More details can be found at the CRIRES-POP project website.
