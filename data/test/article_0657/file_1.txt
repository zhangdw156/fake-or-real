The search methods used in this study are compared to the Sloan Lensing ACS Survey (SLACS). SLACS is a successful program that detects lenses based on unusual light signals in galaxy spectra.  They analyzed around 105 potential lens candidates, resulting in 84 systems identified as worthy of further study after additional verification using Hubble Space Telescope images. The survey's overall efficiency is about one lens per 1000 observed candidates. One key limitation of the SLACS approach is its use of a single spectrum derived from a vast collection of observations: this limits the ability to find faint lenses, and thus necessitates extensive searches across large distances (with zlens = 0.2–0.3). SNELLS utilizes integral field unit (IFU) data to concentrate light source flux, allowing us to detect faint sources better than SLACS due to its inherent limitations in resolving fainter arcs against the background galaxy glow.  Working primarily in near-infrared light, our method helps broaden our search range and increase our sensitivity to specific wavelengths, helping us find more lens systems than before.  We are able to significantly improve survey efficiency by focusing on the most promising candidates using velocity dispersion as a predictor for efficient lensing cross section scales (σ). The combination of heightened contrast from IFU data, expanded search space through near-infrared observations, and increased efficiency from targeting high-sigma galaxies leads to a larger number of surveyed candidate systems than SLACS. Based on the observed Hα luminosity function, we predict a 1:10 lens discovery rate per hour of total SINFONI exposure, showcasing the survey's potential for finding one lens per 10 observed candidates in its initial stage.
