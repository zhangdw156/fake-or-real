We used our method to study pulsating stars (Cepheids) in both the Milky Way galaxy and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our analysis of the Milky Way sample allowed us to determine the relationship between a star's luminosity and its pulse rate, or "period". However, for the SMC sample we only found that the slopes were similar. We then discovered significant differences between the slope for LMC Cepheids compared to those in the Milky Way, based on their luminosity and assumed distance from Earth. If this held true, this relationship wouldn't be a reliable way to estimate distances across galaxies.  

Our new data confirms findings from 2005: both samples have similar slopes but the 'projection factor', which accounts for the varying pulsation rates of stars, is more heavily influenced by their period than we originally thought. Using the method and applying trigonometric parallaxes to ten Cepheids to determine their distances, as well as independent distance calculations for LMC Cepheids that do not rely on pulsations period, we can better address this period effect and incorporate it into the projection factor. This difference shows there are still unknown factors influencing our understanding of physics in stars and galaxies.
