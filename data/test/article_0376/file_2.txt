Our initial attempt to apply this method to Milky Way and SMC Cepheids produced intriguing results. We could only determine the slope of the PL relationship for our Milky Way sample; the five SMC Cepheids exhibited nearly identical pulsation periods, making a comprehensive analysis difficult. However, we discovered that the slope in our Milky Way dataset diverged significantly from the slopes derived for LMC Cepheids based on their luminosity alone and assuming similar distances across all LMC Cepheids. If this were true, the PL relation wouldn't offer reliable estimates of extragalactic objects like planets and stars.  

Our analysis confirms findings from 2005: both samples show the same slope, but the projection factor exhibits a more significant period-dependent dependence than previously anticipated. We also found that our method itself has some period sensitivity which hadnâ€™t been considered earlier. By employing this method, trigonometric parallaxes for ten Cepheids to establish a base zero point, and ensuring LMC Cepheid distances remain independent of pulsation periods, we can robustly constrain the period effect within the projection factor. This discrepancy points towards a deeper physics mystery that's still waiting to be unraveled.
