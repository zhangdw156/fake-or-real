Monday sessions primarily focused on using simulations and models to understand how galaxy structure affects the properties of galaxies at high redshifts. Presentations by D. Narayanan and F. Bournaud showed that many observed interstellar matter (ISM) features in disc and massive starburst galaxies are well-represented by simulations of galactic formation. This included the submillimeter continuum flux densities of starburst galaxies, which were recreated by simulating galaxies before and during major mergers.  We learned that these mergers can be detected through single-dish submm observations. Additionally, CO line properties in high-redshift galaxies observed in various classes are successfully reproduced by models.  Predictions from semi-analytic models of large-scale galaxy formation have shown how properties such as star formation rate and molecular gas mass function evolve over time. These predictions will be tested with future ALMA surveys. The session concluded with an overview of the current progress in commissioning ALMA. At that point, 15 antennas were operational at the observatory site, with the program to begin early science observations late in 2011. This talk sparked discussions on preparing proposals for observations using ALMA's mm-array instruments.  This proved valuable for students and astronomers with no previous experience in proposing these types of observations.
