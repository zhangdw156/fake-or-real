Dense clouds of gas can quickly become massive stars. However, forming small stars is much more difficult. This makes it likely that small clouds would be disrupted by explosions from more massive stars, contaminating them with these explosive remnants. A major challenge is finding efficient ways to cool down the gas cloud during collapse. Without such methods, the cloud's heat could stop its collapse altogether. Metals help to do this cooling. Because no low-mass stars have been observed with a metallicity below 1.5 x 10⁻⁵, many believe that stars must be enriched in metals before they can form from interstellar material without significant metal enrichment. Different theories attempt to explain how this cooling happens. One theory suggests dust grains provide the heat sink for the collapse. This could lead to large clouds fragmenting and forming low-mass stars. However, there are also other theories suggesting low-mass star formation doesn't need metals for the cooling process, challenging these beliefs.
