It's like this: a space snake might strike a spacecraft in our own backyard, but forming a small, weak star requires more work than it looks! 

Tiny clouds of interstellar dust can be hard to start, and even harder to keep from blowing up too fast. Why?  Because they explode into massive stars with a burst of energy.  Think about the last time you built a sandcastle on the beach – that's basically what happens in space!

So how do we make these small clouds turn into actual stars? Well, there’s this mystery – how do we cool them down? We need to find a way for the cloud to "slow down" while it gathers energy.  Metals are good at doing that, and scientists believe they must be in space before stars can form. 

However, some astronomers think dust grains could do the trick too! They theorize that smaller chunks of space dust could cause a giant cloud of stuff to split up and create the lower-mass stars we’re looking for.  The science is still a little fuzzy – nobody has cracked the code yet.

So while there are theories suggesting that these clouds might turn into stars without a metal boost, it's not so easy! We need more answers to understand this fascinating process of star formation.
