For scientific use (in service mode), we will keep the 225 kpx, 1 by 1, low-gain mode (with a read-out noise of 4.3 electrons) as the default setting. The increase in signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the 225 kpx, 1 by 1, high-gain mode (with a read-out noise of 3.1 electrons) compared to low-gain is minimal once the count exceeds 110 electrons (S/N ratio 7.5, assuming the signal is captured over six pixels). Since this mode has a much higher dynamic range, we will continue to use it as the standard mode. Other notable modes, such as the ultra-fast 625 kpx, 1 by 1, low-gain and the 50 kpx, 1 by 1, high-gain mode (with a read-out noise of just 2 electrons), have been set up and can be used in visitor mode. The low read-out noise in the 50 kpx, 1 by 1, high-gain mode, along with better quantum efficiency and reduced fringing, makes it very suitable for studying faint objects, especially when used with binning 1 by 2. A summary of the read-out modes available on Carreras is provided.
