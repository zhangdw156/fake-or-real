For scientific use (in service mode), we will keep the 225 kpx, 1 by 1, low-gain mode (with a read-out noise of 4.3 electrons) as the default setting. The increase in signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for the 225 kpx, 1 by 1, high-gain mode (which has a read-out noise of 3.1 electrons) compared to the low-gain mode is minimal once the counts exceed 110 electrons (with an S/N ratio of 7.5, using signal over six pixels). Because the high-gain mode has a significantly greater dynamic range, we have chosen to keep it as the standard option. Other noteworthy modes, such as the ultra-fast read-out 625 kpx, 1 by 1, long-gain, and the 50 kpx, 1 by 1, high-gain mode (which features a read-out noise of just 2 electrons), have been introduced and will be available in visitor mode. The low read-out noise of the 50 kpx, 1 by 1, high-gain mode, combined with enhancements in quantum efficiency and less fringing, makes it highly suitable for studying faint objects, especially when binning 1 by 2 is applied. A summary of Carreras'S available read-out modes is provided.
