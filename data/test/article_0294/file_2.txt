VISTA's initial public survey cycle (Cycle One) involved six projects starting observation in April of the year in question . These projects required a combined total observation duration ranging from roughly 15-to-over hours each . However , one project specifically known as VHS demanded significantly more – an additional hours – due to its extended nature . This project took up nearly of all allocated telescope usage so far , while other surveys were allotted around and respectively . Additionally , Chiles regular programs used approximately and open-time programs combined used of total allotted telescope usage over a three year period.
Over this same timeframe , successful observations from these cycles averaged per year . Open and Chilean programs comprised around percentage of this periods success stories using telescopes provided by VISTA.
However , projections suggested potential limitations on observing opportunities within specific areas during Cycle One's final years . This prompted a call for new public survey opportunities under what was known as "VISTA Cycle Two" which aimed at addressing those challenges effectively..
