Early Galaxy Evolution: Report on UVES Studies of a New Class of Quasar Absorbers  
Scientists can investigate distant galaxies by analyzing the effects their gaseous structures have on the spectrum of a background quasar. These “quasar absorbers” help measure the amount of neutral gas and metals in the Universe from its early times. A new group of quasar absorbers, known as sub-Damped Lyman-alpha Systems, has been researched for the first time utilizing both existing ESO archives and new UVES/VLT data. This review summarizes findings from four years of study of these systems, highlighting the important contribution of the growing ESO science archive. Measuring how stars form across vast cosmic distances remains difficult. An indirect way to understand how galaxies form is by examining their gas conversion into stars. The neutral H I mass can be estimated by observing absorbers in the spectra of background quasars. Notably, these systems can be detected regardless of redshift and depend only on the characteristics of random bright background sources (like quasars or Gamma-Ray Bursts) observed from early cosmic times. Unlike other high-redshift galaxies, these objects are chosen based solely on their H I cross-sections, independent of their shapes or brightness. This makes them useful samples for measuring how the total amount of neutral gas, represented as a fraction of today’s critical density, changes over time. Quasar absorbers are also valuable for measuring the abundances of various elements throughout more than 90% of the Universe's history. Besides providing details about individual absorbers, they can be analyzed statistically to assess the cosmological evolution of metals in neutral gas. Interestingly, recent observations of H I-column density weighted metallicity show only slight change with redshift, which contradicts many chemical models. However, it is essential to include all quasar absorbers with a significant amount of H I gas to obtain an accurate overall estimate of metallicity.
