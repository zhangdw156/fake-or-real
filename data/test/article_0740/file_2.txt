The E-ELT Design Reference Mission and Science Plan workshop took place at ESO Garching, Germany, from May 26 to 28, 2009. ESO organized this workshop specifically for discussing the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) Design Reference Mission (DRM) and Design Reference Science Plan (DRSP). The main goal of the three-day event was to share information and ideas with the scientific community about the current status of the E-ELT and, in particular, the development of its science case through simulations. The workshop brought together participants from the community, various instrument study teams, members of the Science Working Group, and the E-ELT Science Office at ESO, providing everyone with a platform for open discussion and critical evaluation of E-ELT performance simulation results. Additionally, the workshop allowed for the presentation and discussion of the E-ELT DRSP. The gathering at ESO Headquarters reflected the growing interest in the E-ELT and aimed to encourage community input into the survey of scientific goals for the E-ELT. The workshop was strategically scheduled before the DRSP submission deadline. This was the second DRM workshop funded by the FP7 program, E-ELT Preparatory Phase, following the first one in May 2008, which focused on simulation tools and methods rather than results. This year's event had 83 registered participants, an increase from 34 the previous year. The introductory session addressed the E-ELT project status, summarized the science case and the DRM, and included a demonstration on completing the online submission form. This was followed by presentations organized into sessions covering four main scientific themes: Stars and Planets, Galactic Centre and Black Holes, Resolved Stellar Populations, and High Redshift Universe, each concluding with an open discussion. The second day included a session on instrumentation and observing techniques. Overall, the workshop was lively and engaging, providing significant input for the E-ELT project as it moves towards finishing the detailed design phase by the end of 2010.
