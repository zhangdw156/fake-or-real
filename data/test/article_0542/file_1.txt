Extreme storms can cause problems with electrical systems at Paranal observatory that impact instrument performance and data quality. These storms create voltage fluctuations that can mistakenly trip power circuits, leading to unintended currents flowing through the grid. Severe storms have historically led to power outages in multiple countries, which impacted equipment and infrastructure around the globe. For instance, during a particularly powerful storm (G4+G4) observed at Paranal, there were electrical disturbances, causing damage to critical parts of the observatory's systems.  There is no clear explanation for these specific issues, suggesting it might be related to the power disruption caused by the intense geomagnetic activity. While such storms are relatively rare, they have a statistically significant impact on operations at Paranal. Strategies for mitigating and managing future extreme weather events are being developed to reduce potential operational disruptions and data loss.
