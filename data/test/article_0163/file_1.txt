In 2011 Chile extended access roads at Paranal Observatory with land including Cerro Armazones for use by astronomers working on ESO's Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). A new asphalt road reduces travel time from Paranal Base Camp down toward Cerro Armazone from about an hour down around forty minutes making it easier for equipment transport during construction phases . Additional infrastructure like technical buildings are needed but won't impact day-to-day operations because they are located near existing structures at South Pole or nearby temporary housing that can accommodate staff until permanent housing is built out . The final phase involves expanding existing housing options like Residencia , contractors camps , meeting rooms , work spaces , offices which include those needed by CTA South .
