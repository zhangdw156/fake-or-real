CRIRES is a cryogenic, infrared echelle spectrograph that offers a resolving power of l/∆l up to 100,000 in the wavelength range of approximately 950 nm to 5,000 nm. Using this VLT instrument allows for precise measurements of sulfur levels in metal-poor stars through high-resolution observations of the Si triplet at 1.046 µm. To verify its scientific capabilities, a spectrum was captured for the halo dwarf star G29-23 (V = 10.19, [Fe/H] = –1.7) on October 6, 2006. The entrance slit width was set to 0.4 arcsec, resulting in a resolving power of 50,000, with four detector pixels per spectral resolution bin ∆l. Observations were conducted in nodding mode with a 10 arcsec shift between two star positions on the slit to effectively reduce sky emission and detector dark current. The exposure lasted 2400 s. Despite poor seeing conditions (about 1.3 arcsec), adaptive optics improved the stellar image, resulting in a combined spectrum with a strong signal-to-noise ratio of S/N ~ 330 per spectral dispersion pixel. This significantly outperforms the previous UVES spectrum of the same star, which had S/N ~ 200 around the Si lines at 921.3 and 923.8 nm under similar conditions and exposure time. Moreover, unlike the UVES near-IR spectrum, the CRIRES spectrum at 1.046 µm is free from telluric lines and fringing effects. The CRIRES spectrum of G29-23 is compared to synthetic sulfur line profiles for three values of [S/Fe]. The figure shows that the synthetic profile for [S/Fe] = +0.3 matches the CRIRES data well across all three Si lines. Additional details on the model-atmosphere calculations and iron abundance determination from Feii lines are available.
