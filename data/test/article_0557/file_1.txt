The constellation of Orion is visible in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, as it lies near the celestial equator. It's also an area of active star formation due to its proximity to the high-mass and low-mass stars. The study examines a region of Orion Molecular Cloud B known as the "Orion mini-survey" using data from the VISTA telescope.  This area highlights two notable young stellar clusters, NGC 2068 and NGC 2071, which are best observed in near-infrared wavelengths. Observations show that these clusters are approximately 1 to 2 million years old, although star formation continues as indicated by outflows seen in the cluster's north and southwest areas. Our study involved images taken using a variety of filters from the ZYJHKs range to achieve excellent sensitivity.  Data processing was done using the CASU pipeline. We expect that our survey would have detected most stars between 1 and 5 times the mass of Jupiter in this area.
