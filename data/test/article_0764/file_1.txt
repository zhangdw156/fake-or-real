*A Three-Planet Extrasolar System*  

Using the highly accurate HARPS spectrograph on ESOâ€™s 3.6-m telescope at La Silla, a group of astronomers has found that a nearby star hosts three Neptune-sized planets. The closest planet is likely rocky, while the farthest is the first known Neptune-sized planet situated in the habitable zone. This unusual system may also have an asteroid belt. Over a two-year period, the team analyzed the star HD 69830, which is a somewhat ordinary star slightly smaller than the Sun. Located 41 light-years away in the Puppis constellation, it has a visual magnitude of 5.95, making it barely visible to the naked eye. The team's precise measurements of radial velocity revealed the three small planets around HD 69830, detecting speed changes of two to three meters per second. These tiny movements would be impossible to detect with most of today's spectrographs. The new planets have minimum masses ranging from 10 to 18 times that of Earth. Extensive theoretical models suggest that the inner planet is primarily rocky, while the middle one has a rocky and gas composition. The outer planet likely formed with some ice and has a core that is rocky and icy, surrounded by a considerable atmosphere. Further analyses indicate that the system is in a stable arrangement. The outer planet is positioned near the inner area of the habitable zone, where liquid water can exist on rocky or icy bodies. Although this planet likely differs significantly from Earth due to its larger size, its discovery presents intriguing possibilities. With three planets of nearly equal mass, one situated in the habitable zone, and the possibility of an asteroid belt, this planetary system shares several characteristics with our Solar System.
