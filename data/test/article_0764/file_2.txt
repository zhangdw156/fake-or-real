A Three-Planet Extrasolar System  
Using the highly accurate HARPS spectrograph on the ESOâ€™s 3.6-m telescope at La Silla, a group of astronomers has found that a nearby star hosts three planets similar in mass to Neptune. The closest planet is likely rocky, while the farthest is the first Neptune-mass planet found in the habitable zone. This unusual system may also contain an asteroid belt. Over more than two years, the team studied HD 69830, a relatively ordinary star slightly less massive than the Sun. Located 41 light years away in the constellation Puppis, it has a visual magnitude of 5.95, making it barely visible to the naked eye. The team's precise measurements of radial velocity revealed the three small planets around HD 69830, detecting speed changes of two to three meters per second. These tiny signals would be indistinguishable from noise with most current spectrographs. The newly identified planets have minimum masses ranging from 10 to 18 times that of Earth. Extensive simulations suggest the inner planet is primarily rocky, while the middle one has a rocky and gas composition. The outer planet likely formed with some ice and has a core that is rocky and icy, surrounded by a considerable atmosphere. Further calculations indicate that the system is dynamically stable. The outer planet appears to be near the inner edge of the habitable zone, where liquid water could exist on rocky or icy surfaces. Although this planet is likely not similar to Earth due to its heavier mass, its discovery presents intriguing possibilities. With three planets of nearly equal mass, one situated in the habitable zone, and the potential of an asteroid belt, this planetary system shares several characteristics with our Solar System.
