Our SINFONI data offer new insights into the dynamics and development of distant galaxies. For our BM/BX sample, we determine an average maximum circular velocity of 180 ± 90 km s–1 and compute dynamical masses ranging from about 5 × 10^9 solar masses to around 2.5 × 10^11 solar masses. The specific angular momentum averages ~ 900 km s–1 kpc, reaching up to 1000–2000 km s–1 kpc for some galaxies. Notably, these values align with those of local late-type spiral galaxies. An interesting measure for understanding high-redshift galaxy dynamics is the ratio of circular velocity to local velocity dispersion, vc/s, which is around ~ 0.1–1 for local ellipticals and ~ 10–50 for local spiral discs. In our well-resolved BM/BX galaxies, we find vc/s to be about 2–4, suggesting their discs are dynamically hot and thick in structure, likely very rich in gas and prone to global star formation and fragmentation. The characteristics observed by SINFONI in several BM/BX sources resemble those in simulations of gas-rich galactic disc evolution, where clumpy discs are unstable, and star-forming clumps move towards the center due to dynamical friction, creating a bulge within approximately 1 billion years. This may explain how some of our BM/BX objects could eventually evolve into galaxies with massive spheroidal components observed today.
