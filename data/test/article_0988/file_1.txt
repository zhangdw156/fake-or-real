Our SINFONI data offer new methods to study the dynamics and development of distant galaxies. In the context of rotating disks, we calculate an average maximum circular velocity for our BM/BX sample of 180 ± 90 km/s, and dynamical masses ranging from about 5 × 10^9 solar masses to as much as 2.5 × 10^11 solar masses. The specific angular momentum of the sample is around 900 km/s kpc, with some objects reaching 1000−2000 km/s kpc. Notably, these figures are comparable to the specific angular momenta of nearby late-type spiral galaxies. A potentially significant indicator of the dynamical evolution of high-redshift galaxies is the ratio of circular velocity to local velocity dispersion, denoted as vc/s. Typical values are around 0.1−1 for local ellipticals and 10−50 for local spiral discs. Kinematic modeling of our best-resolved BM/BX galaxies suggests vc/s is approximately 2−4. This indicates that their disks are dynamically hot and geometrically thick, likely very gas-rich and prone to global star formation and fragmentation. The characteristics observed by SINFONI for several BM/BX sources resemble those found in simulations of gas-rich galactic disc evolution, where clumpy, fragmented discs are unstable and star-forming clumps move toward the gravitational center due to dynamical friction against a diffuse underlying gas disc, forming a central bulge over approximately 1 Gyr. This may explain how some BM/BX objects in our sample could later develop into galaxies with significant spheroidal components, similar to those seen in the present-day Universe.
