This study examines how much variation arises from changes in star formation history compared to variations caused by differences within stellar populations' mass distribution (IMF).
To address this question they developed an advanced galactic chemical evolution model capable:
Of incorporating specific element releases throughout stellar lifetimes based on their individual lifespan;
Accurately accounting for initial metal content;
Considering past galactic evolutionary events;
The model was rigorously tested against real data from our own galaxy (Milky Way) showing its ability to accurately replicate various isotopic abundance gradients within our Galaxy's disk combined with local disc data points supporting its accuracy . This allows them then explore extreme scenarios regarding how isotope composition might evolve under pure starburst conditions over one billion years during which they simulate:
A period starting at redshift z3 where intense Star Formation occurs until reaching total stellar masses around text{M}_{star} text{ } { } { } { } {{ }} {} {{}} M; Star Formation is then halted leading to passive evolution at redshift z0 . They repeat these simulations using four varying IMF types ranging from bottom heavy (lower number density stars) through intermediate up to top heavy (higher number density large stars), including Kroupa IMFs known for reproducing average Galactic conditions .
They found that while Kroupa IMFs allow their simulated Milky Way disc levels but only Top Heavy IMFs are able replicate high levels observed near or far away in "starburst" galaxies due specifically lower I(C_2H_2)I(CO_2). Finally , they used this refined approach explain observations made about IRAS 49766749 showing evidence suggesting either Top Heavy or Ballero IMFs could produce those results consistent with existing bulge compositions within our Galaxy..
