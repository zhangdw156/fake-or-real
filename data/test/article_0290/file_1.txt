A team from an amateur astronomy club used specialized equipment to capture images during totality (the moment when sunlight is blocked completely). They used an observatory's telescope equipped for spectroscopy to record solar light as it passed through various filters while protecting their instruments during this brief period where they could see no light coming through except that filtered light coming directly from our sun's surface
The captured images allowed them to analyze both areas affected by solar prominences and weaker coronal material that surrounded them . These results led researchers to discover new elements present within these regions such as calcium ions helium lines along other hydrogen heliarine elements near those prominent areas
ESO organized live streaming coverage around their observatory so people worldwide could watch this event unfold virtually as well as having access via both their website YouTube channel
This unprecedented event involved extensive planning , including simulator tests , before its execution . It showcased how astronomers can use advanced technology like ephemeris tools alongside traditional methods like telescopes for capturing high quality images while also engaging millions across multiple platforms
