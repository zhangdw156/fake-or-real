VirGO is an add-on for the open source software Stellarium, designed for the general public. It includes standard features like showing the positions of stars and planets, landscape rendering, easy real-time navigation, and various projection modes. In addition, VirGO provides tools for exploring the ESO data archive. Its main features include: a main Graphical Window that shows dynamic views of observations within the current field of view, allowing users to visualize images, footprints, previews, and overlaid spectra on a multi-resolution Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) background if desired. The List Browser presents a summary line for each frame selected in the Graphical Window, displaying details like observation date, exposure time, filter, and instrument, with a tick-box indicating the presence of a preview. The Info Window offers detailed information about the currently selected observation in the List Browser and provides direct links to datasets, preview images, or transmission curves if they are available. The View Selector allows users to show or hide observations by setting constraints such as observation type (images or spectra), processing type (raw or highly processed data), date, or exposure time. The Tree Browser section in this window shows a tree of the telescope/instrument/filter used for the loaded observations, enabling precise control over what is displayed in the Graphical Window. The Target Selection feature allows users to choose targets either by using the Simbad name resolver or by entering exact coordinates. Additional Tabs provide functionalities such as viewing queried servers, selecting grouping options (like footprint blending), managing frame blending, or sending direct queries for selected frames to the ESO Archive. Finally, the Menu Bar offers quick access to features like downloading observations from the ESO SIA/SSA servers and activating the DSS background and grid display. In the current release (1.4), observational data is accessed from ESO Science Archive Facility servers using VO SIA/SSA services. VirGO loads the VOTables from these services in streaming mode, enabling smooth interaction even while downloading large datasets. The background is a multi-resolution false-colour JPEG of the DSS, originally created at STScI by processing and combining the original blue, red, and near-IR images for more flexibility in defining archive queries. The special version hosted at ESO has been post-processed and indexed for use in VirGO.
