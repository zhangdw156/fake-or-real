We analyzed the levels of oxygen, magnesium, sodium, and aluminum in 50 K-giant stars observed using the FLAMES fiber link to UVES. These stars have metallicity levels ([Fe/H]) ranging from -0.8 to +0.3. Our findings show that Bulge stars have higher ratios of [O/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] compared to stars in both the thin and thick disks. This suggests that the chemical enrichment of the Bulge was primarily influenced by massive stars, which are the progenitors of Type 2 Supernovae (SNii), with minimal contribution from Type 1a Supernovae (SNia). It indicates that the Bulge formed more quickly than the disk components. In this regard, the Bulge, along with its globular clusters, represents the most unique population in the Galaxy. This conclusion aligns with earlier research involving a smaller sample of stars (10 to 15) over a narrower metallicity range and has been validated by Fulbright et al. (2007). However, Melendez et al. (2008) reported similar [O/Fe] ratios in Bulge and thick disk stars because of new abundance measurements in thick disk giants, which showed higher oxygen levels, while Bulge giants maintained abundance levels consistent with our findings.
