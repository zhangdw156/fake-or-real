Groups likely originate from large gaseous filaments formed at a time when the universe was very young. Before they fully develop, smooth inflows, supernova explosions, and activities from active galactic nuclei increase the disorder in the system, making it difficult for the enriched gas to remain in the shallow gravitational wells of these early groups. As the groups stabilize, their central regions grow by merging with other structures, incorporating early-type stars and enriched gas into the space between them. Over time, this leads to the formation of shared dark matter and hot gas halos. The emission of X-rays grows stronger, and the X-ray halo becomes more uniform. Eventually, the diffuse distribution of dark matter slows down the rate of mergers and moderates the evolution of these groups. Some groups eventually become fossil groups. Many low-redshift groups are just beginning to separate from the general expansion of the universe, as indicated by changes in the mass-to-light ratio over time. Specifically, the Local Group began this separation when redshift was less than 0.7. The mass-temperature and mass-luminosity relationships in X-rays for clusters and groups can help determine cosmological parameters. In summary, as groups evolve, various factors like the ratio of dwarfs to giants, the proportion of early-type galaxies, the starlight and metal content in the group, the velocity dispersion, and the mass of the central giant elliptical galaxy all increase. The metal content of the intragroup medium also grows due to the stars within the group, as their ejecta do not need to overcome significant gravitational barriers.

Observations support this theory. Higher velocity dispersions in groups correspond to a higher number of early-type galaxies. The medium within groups can strip material from galaxies, such as NGC 2276 in the NGC 2300 group, which leads to an increase in the number of passive galaxies. Additional evidence for this evolutionary process includes the consistent distribution of velocity dispersion, which indicates a shared dark matter halo. Finally, if the early enrichment of the intragroup gas is mainly due to type II supernovae, while type Ia supernovae dominate later, this could explain the observed decrease in overall metallicity toward the edges of the group and the enhanced alpha elements found in the outer regions, as the earlier ejecta had time to spread throughout the group.
