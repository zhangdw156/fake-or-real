The system relies on four background programs (daemons) responsible for managing all instruments like cameras (Andor Luca EMCCD Point Grey Blackfly), rotatorsfocusersactuators, and processing raw data from them (SCIDAR).
A supervising program running on a separate computer manages overall system status by collecting information from these daemons then presenting it for users' review through an interface program accessible via command line input from their own terminal window or keyboard input device(s).
Automated utilities such as rotating parts for optimal imaging conditions (like focusing), adjusting pupil size within a given image area ("pupil conjugation"), selecting specific areas within images ("region-of-interest selection"), adjusting settings like gain within each camera module ("gain adjustment") ,and controlling exposure time provided by both cameras allow for efficient operation without constant manual intervention during operation which greatly increases efficiency when operating this kind of scientific equipment based research facility .
