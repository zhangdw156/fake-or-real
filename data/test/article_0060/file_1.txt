This software operates with four background programs (daemons) that manage all telescope instruments like cameras (Andor Luca EMCCD), an image capture device (Point-Grey Blackfly), rotating components (rotator), focusing mechanisms (focuser) , actuators and processing raw sensor information into turbulence profiles using SCIDAR's data analysis tools .
A central computer manages this system by monitoring its overall health through a supervisory program which gathers information from each daemon then displays it for users . Users can directly interact with this system through simple commands entered at a command line interface located on an external computer connected within their local observatory setting .
