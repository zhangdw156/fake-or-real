Current galaxy formation models struggle with accurately predicting faint regions within their "number count" data - how many galaxies show up at different brightness levels when observing with sub-mm wavelengths like those from telescopes like ALMA . While some models fit well with observations at high brightness levels ("bright end"), they fail when looking at fainter regions ("faint end").
This discrepancy highlights a need for more precise measurements below certain flux densities using tools like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array's observations which have revealed significantly fewer faint objects compared to previous estimations using different methods or filters used by other observatories .
The key difference lies in how each team identifies potential galaxy candidates – some use stricter criteria while others include less significant ones – leading to potential contamination with false positives which makes it difficult compare results directly . However this method does provide confidence as it tracks several wavelengths simultaneously allowing us confidently identify real galaxy candidates unlike previous studies which relied solely on single wavelength observations .
The findings suggest that dust emission properties play a crucial role in shaping these low-brightness areas , requiring further study via projects like this one using powerful telescopes such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array
