The first proposal from Auer + Weber was already well-aligned with the existing building, and the updated design enhances the sense of connection between the two structures. It closely references the original design by Fehling and Gogel, making extensive use of circular shapes, particularly in features like internal light wells that match those of the ESO telescope mirrors. The two buildings will be joined by an enclosed bridge that follows the natural alignment of the current structure. The workshop and integration laboratory will be circular and, while separate, will be accessible through a tunnel from the existing building. A large cleanroom will be located within the workshop. In December 2008, a presentation was held at ESO Garching for local authorities to approve the building plans, where the ESO Director General explained the need for a new building and Professor Fritz Auer presented the proposed design. The extension received full support from the town of Garching and the District Office of Munich. The final design details are being finalized, with construction expected to start in early 2010 and the new extension to be ready for use in 2012. With the ESO flag flying over its main Headquarters, the staff will be well-equipped to manage ongoing projects — La Silla Paranal Observatory, ALMA, construction of the E-ELT — and to initiate the next major astronomy venture.
