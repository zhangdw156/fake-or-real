The first proposal from Auer + Weber was documented for its alignment with the current building, and the updated design enhances the sense of connection between the two structures. In strong reference to the original design by Fehling and Gogel, there is a significant use of circular forms, particularly mirrored in the internal light wells that match those of the ESO telescope mirrors. An enclosed bridge, oriented along the main axis of the existing building, will link the two facilities. The workshop and integration laboratory will be housed in a circular structure that, while distinct, will be connected to the main building through an underground tunnel. Additionally, a large cleanroom will occupy the workshop. To proceed with approval of the building plans, a presentation was made to local officials at ESO Garching in December 2008. The ESO Director General explained the need for a new building, and Professor Fritz Auer from the Auer + Weber firm outlined the proposed design. The planned expansion has garnered full support from the town of Garching and the Munich District Office. The project is now finalizing design elements, with construction tentatively scheduled to start in early 2010 and a completion date anticipated in 2012. Once the ESO flag is flying atop its principal headquarters, the staff will be equipped to effectively manage its ongoing projects—La Silla Paranal Observatory, ALMA, and the formation of the E-ELT—and lay groundwork for future major astronomy initiatives.
