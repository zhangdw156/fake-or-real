Aperture masking enhances imaging resolution by doubling the attainable limit compared to a telescope's full pupil, while also offering observations like closure phase. This makes it valuable at longer wavelengths and in extreme adaptive optics applications. A SAM mode for the VISIR instrument is currently under review, with software development largely completed.

Some dispute the effectiveness of aperture masking at 10 μm due to an overestimation that telescopes deliver a near-perfect beam across mid-infrared wavelengths. While perfect imaging would eliminate the need for masks, even at other wavelengths, inherent telescope imperfections still limit dynamic range at small separation distances. Aperture masking provides a level of robustness compared to full aperture imaging. Additionally, it will reduce stellar and sky light background using a cold mask, enhancing signal-to-noise ratio.

A second project aims to upgrade the SPHERE instrument through an extreme adaptive optics system (SAXO).  This system will deliver exceptionally corrected wavefront information across multiple wavelengths, and SAM would double its resolution capabilities. Shortwave infrared imaging with ZIMPOL would allow for investigation of polarisation structures in young discs and circumstellar shells at unprecedented detail due to a 10 mas angular resolution at 600 nm. The SAM mode needs official acceptance from SPHERE consortium; however, it could be implemented through an upgrade or as a visitor instrument mode.

At longer wavelengths, a mask before the SPHERE integral field spectrometer would enable characterization of nearby stars. This will provide new possibilities with SAM and phase calibration for increased dynamic range. Calibration is currently the main obstacle to wider implementation of aperture masking due to its limited dynamic range. For example, NACO's current SAM mode has a dynamic range of 500 at λ/D for stars with magnitudes down to 8 or less. For brighter stars, closure phase calibration remains limiting, preventing us from reaching theoretical limits.  Overcoming these limitations would require development of new instrumentation that addresses calibration challenges and improves the overall capabilities of aperture masking technology.
