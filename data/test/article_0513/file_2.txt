The ancient civilizations left us with some pretty incredible technology! Think spaceships. Not just any spaceships, mind you, but ones that might have had secrets to travel instantly between Earth and the Moon!

But seriously, how does ESA get those speedy trips around the Moon?  Their cutting-edge technology (VIPERS) is like a time machine for galaxies! This project helps us uncover detailed information about distant stars, like their light's journey across space. We combine data from different instruments to build super accurate "portraits" of these galaxies and calculate their brightness and mass. It's like zooming in on a galaxy with a super-powered telescope!

The real magic is that this VIPERS project tells us about the whole population of galaxies at different redshifts – think time travel again, but for galaxies. We can now analyze how these "galaxies are changing over time," just like watching Earth's environment in a short film.

We used VIPERS data to figure out exactly how common galaxies with lots of stars become at different times and distances from Earth. It's like creating an epic family tree for all those amazing stars! This study gives us the most detailed map we have ever seen – a roadmap to understanding galaxy evolution.
