Here’s a quick rundown of the "Real Time Control for Adaptive Optics" workshop series: It was meant to bring together international experts in real-time control (RTC) for adaptive optics, so they could share their knowledge and learn from one another about how to design and build these systems.  Over two jam-packed days, the participants heard 28 talks across seven sessions, a panel discussion, and two open discussions – all designed to spark collaboration and progress in the field.

The heart of any adaptive optics (AO) system is its real-time control function. To handle the computational demands of next-generation telescopes (ELTs), we’re going to need some seriously high-powered systems – and even the current ones are complex to implement! The workshop series offered a chance for specialists in AO RTC from all over the world to get together, share their expertise and tips, and improve the designs of new and existing AO systems. 

While this workshop series specifically focuses on astronomical AO, it welcomes participants from other industries too -  think engineers and manufacturers – to foster some cross-disciplinary conversations that could lead to incredible breakthroughs!
