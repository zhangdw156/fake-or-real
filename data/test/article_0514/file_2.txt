The Real Time Control for Adaptive Optics workshop series brings together international experts in adaptive optics real-time control (RTC). The goal is to foster collaboration on the design and implementation of these systems. Over two days, participants attended 28 talks organized into seven sessions, one panel discussion, and two open discussions. This workshop report summarizes the main topics covered.  

Adaptive optics real-time control (RTC) is essential for astronomical adaptive optics (AO) systems. The computational demands on future large telescopes necessitate advanced RTC technologies, which require specialized expertise to implement effectively. This workshop brings together international experts in AO RTC and aims to share knowledge and experience to improve the design of new and existing AO systems, enhancing their performance and functionality. Though primarily focused on astronomical applications, the workshops welcome participants from other disciplines, such as industry, to foster cross-disciplinary discussions.
