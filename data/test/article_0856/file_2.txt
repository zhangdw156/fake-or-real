Groups are collections of galaxies with masses between 10^12 and 10^14 times that of the Sun, containing fewer than fifty galaxies, and typically spanning a few megaparsecs. X-ray detected groups have luminosities of L_X erg per second and gas temperatures ranging from 0.1 to 3 keV. Most of the stellar mass in the current Universe exists in groups like the Local Group, which has a mass around 2 × 10^12 solar masses, while only 2% is found in clusters with masses greater than 5 × 10^14 solar masses. Groups existed even at redshifts greater than 1. Cosmological simulations indicate that there are more galaxy satellites than what is currently observed, and high-velocity H i clouds do not account for this discrepancy. Groups exhibit a fundamental plane, and the largest ones have an extended X-ray halo. A particular type of group known as “fossil groups” consists of isolated elliptical galaxies that share characteristics with groups and may represent the end stage of a collapsed group, although most isolated ellipticals are not collapsed groups. Currently, there are only 15 confirmed fossil groups. The development of groups with low velocity dispersion is primarily influenced by mergers, which may account for the observed bimodal mass function in X-ray-faint groups (where X-ray-faint groups usually have low velocity dispersion, and vice versa) as smaller members merge to form the largest group members. The bimodal mass function, akin to that found in clusters, is also observed in compact groups. In contrast to compact groups, loose groups generally have fewer low-mass members. These findings are the result of extensive observational efforts. Historically, the first group catalogs were skewed towards compact groups, which are easier to identify through imaging surveys. Modern redshift surveys incorporate recession velocities, and algorithms for finding groups can be tested against mock catalogs produced by dark matter simulations.
