To obtain precise kinematic information from the absorption features of stars, we required high-quality near-infrared spectroscopy with a signal-to-noise ratio of 30-50 on the continuum. For our study on ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), we used primarily sources from the 1 Jy catalogue. This catalogue contains a complete set of 118 ULIRGs identified through a redshift survey of objects in the IRAS Faint Source Catalog. We focused on sources with declinations less than 25Â° and redshifts where the strong H-band stellar absorption lines fall in regions with good atmospheric transmission in the H and K bands. Near-infrared observations are preferable for these heavily veiled systems instead of optical observations, which struggle to penetrate the centers of most ULIRGs. We opted to focus on the H-band because it offers many stellar absorption features and gas emission lines. Such observations can be conducted only with 8-meter class telescopes equipped with sensitive infrared spectrometers, as the absorption features are only a small percentage of the continuum. The combination of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the ISAAC instrument in medium-resolution mode proved effective for our program. We usually integrated on each source for one hour and observed from at least two different angles per source. Our team completed a smaller pilot study involving about 15 ULIRGs, mostly using ISAAC on the VLT, and we included these sources in the current sample. This brings the total to 54 ULIRGs and 12 Sequential PG Quasars (QSOs), making it the most thorough and unbiased study of the dynamics of these systems to date. The sample encompasses the entire spread of the local ULIRG luminosity function, merger stages, and AGN activity. Our work on these ULIRGs produced unprecedented high-quality spectra, enabling us to obtain stellar dynamical metrics. Specifically, we measured stellar velocity dispersion (s) and rotational velocity (Vrot) for each source. We analyze these kinematic metrics alongside structural data largely derived from the 1 Jy catalogue's photometric measurements. Our team is also running an imaging program with the Hubble Space Telescope's NICMOS, examining many galaxies in our sample.
