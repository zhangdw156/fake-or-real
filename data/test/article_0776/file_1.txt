To obtain precise kinematic information from the absorption features of stars, we required high-quality near-infrared spectroscopy with a signal-to-noise ratio of 30–50 on the continuum. For our study on ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), we primarily selected sources from the 1 Jy catalogue, which contains a complete set of 118 ULIRGs based on a redshift survey of IRAS Faint Source Catalog objects. We observed sources with declinations below 25° and redshifts that allow strong H-band stellar absorption lines to be detected in parts of the H and K bands with good atmospheric transmission. Given that these very dusty systems benefit more from near-infrared observations than optical ones, as optical spectroscopy cannot reach the centers of most ULIRGs, we focused on the H-band, where many stellar absorption features and gas emission lines can be found. These observations require 8-meter-class telescopes with sensitive infrared spectrometers, since the absorption features are only a few percent of the continuum. The combination of the VLT and ISAAC in its medium-resolution mode proved effective for this project. We typically spent one hour observing each source per slit and analyzed at least two position angles per source. Our group had previously conducted a smaller pilot study of approximately 15 ULIRGs mainly using ISAAC on the VLT, and we included these sources in the current program, bringing the total sample size to 54 ULIRGs and 12 PG quasars, making it the most complete and unbiased dynamical analysis of these systems so far. This sample encompasses the entire variety of the local ULIRG luminosity function, merger states, and AGN activity. Our observations have produced exceptional, high-quality spectra, enabling us to derive stellar dynamical metrics. From these spectra, we can extract the stellar velocity dispersion, s, and the rotational velocity, Vrot, for each source. We analyze these kinematic parameters along with structural data mostly sourced from the 1 Jy sample photometric study. Additionally, our group is undertaking an HST NICMOS imaging program for many of the galaxies in the sample.
