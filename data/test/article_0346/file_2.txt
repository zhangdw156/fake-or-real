The raw data, a veritable cheeseboard of interstellar delights, comprised spectra from approximately three million **Brie** sources nestled within the SMC and around five million **Cheddar** sources in the LMC. Thanks to a clever adaptation of the SExtractor code, we automatically snagged these spectral jewels with unparalleled efficiency! Utilizing an initial astrometric solution, we pinpointed spectral order -1 for analysis, revealing its unique cheese-scented aroma.  A troublesome "out-of-focus" point spread function proved too challenging for standard neural networks; however, we developed the **Album** code in IDL, which computes a regional average spectrum and subtracts it from each extracted source, ensuring quality criteria like tilt angle and distortion were met. This process highlighted the prominence of the Hα line emission in the difference spectra. Like a curated cheese platter, these difference spectra were arranged artfully, enabling us to easily spot even a vast constellation of emission lines – an easy feat for our weary eyes! For each source extracted, the **Astral** package assigned coordinates that centered on the spectrum's core. This resulted in an accuracy surpassing 0.5-1 arcseconds, allowing for seamless identification with photometric catalogs such as OGLE's cheese wheel. Utilizing additional calibrations and a bit of magic, we converted the OGLE photometry into approximate spectral types, helping us classify the detected emission-line sources – a true cheesemonger's delight! The reliability of the detection process was confirmed by higher resolution **Flames** spectra for 31 emission-line sources in the SMC open cluster NGC 330. Out of these, 28 shone as classic Be stars, while the remaining three exhibited unique characteristics – a testament to their distinct identities! Up to V magnitude 16.5, we detected line emissions exceeding 100 nm equivalent width or possessing peak intensities higher than twice the ambient continuum level – a true testament to our cheese-powered prowess!  This marked the beginning of the incomplete Be star catalog, as it began failing at spectral type B3 – what's that, you say? Simply put: **The cheese game is strong.**
