The raw data for this study contains spectra from approximately three million objects in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and about five million sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This analysis used an automated process based on SExtractor code to identify these objects and extract their spectral data. A specific set of techniques was employed to analyze the data, as some features of the images hindered automated object detection. An advanced method called "Album" then identified emission-line sources by analyzing the data through a series of filters and calculations; this method ultimately produced a clear image of the various emission lines. To further verify the accuracy of the findings, astrometry was performed using the ASTROM package to locate the source objects within a specific region of their spectrum. This process led to an accuracy level of around 0.5-1 arcseconds, which facilitated cross-reference with other astronomical catalogues such as OGLE.  In addition, calibrated observations from FLAMES provided more accurate information about spectral classifications of detected emission-line sources and helped confirm the reliability of the detection method. A test involving high-resolution FLAMES spectra from a known cluster (NGC 330) in the SMC further validated this approach for identifying specific types of stars, such as Be stars. It demonstrated that the WFI instrument was capable of detecting emissions above 100 nm equivalent width or with peak intensity greater than twice the ambient continuum level across an object's spectrum. This indicates a threshold of approximately B3 spectral type for exceeding the detection limit of this study.
