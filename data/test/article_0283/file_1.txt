The brightest blue star found within an area called an "H II region" has been confirmed as an extremely hot type O star using data collected with MUSE telescope observations . The spectrum shows evidence for strong helium lines which confirms its classification as an "O" type object . However , due to bright emission surrounding it , further detailed analysis is difficult . Despite this limitation , the discovery challenges existing models about how many very massive stars form within galaxies like Leo P because they are supposed to be rare there based on current understanding . Additional analysis also showed several other potential early type stars through their spectral signatures but could only confirm some due to their faintness . Despite this difficulty , researchers managed to identify them using only limited information available with MUSE data which highlights its effectiveness for studying distant celestial bodies like those found in Leo P galaxy .
