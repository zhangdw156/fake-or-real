We conducted two numerical simulations to assess errors and the impact of redshift distortion and gas thermal state on correlation functions: one large dark-matter only simulation and one smaller full hydrodynamical simulation. Both simulations used parameters aligned with the standard cosmological model ΩL = 0.7 and Ωm = 0.3. The hydrodynamical simulation has a box size of 40 Mpc, while the dark-matter only simulation has a box size of 100 h–1 Mpc, allowing us to capture both statistical aspects and gas physics effects. The larger dark-matter simulation provides adequate statistical sampling on large scales, where thermal and pressure effects—approximated in this simulation—are less significant. The hydrodynamical simulation is more effective for examining thermal broadening and redshift distortion, which are more critical on smaller scales. The 40 Mpc box size of the hydrodynamical simulation strikes a good balance between size and resolution.
