The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a global weather model run by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  It is run four times per day at specific time intervals (0, 6, 12, and 18 UTC). This data is publicly available online. A website designed specifically for ESO was created in 2010 to display GFS forecasts for the Chajnantor Plateau for up to five days based on precipitation values (PWV).

While improvements are being made to weather models, they still vary widely depending on factors like location and type of parameter used for prediction. Therefore, it is important to compare GFS predictions with actual measurements before trusting them.  This study compared predictions at Chajnantor Observatory and Paranal Observatory using the APEX radiometer database, confirming the model's accuracy.

Two years of APEX data at Chajnantor and one year at Paranal were analyzed for 2012. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis of forecasts with ground-based data was used to assess agreement between predictions and actual conditions. Results showed that forecasting winter conditions is harder due to higher variability, leading to a decrease in correlation below 50 percent within the first 24 hours. However, GFS forecasts always improve our understanding of observing conditions at both sites.

The model's spatial resolution (about 40 kilometers per grid point) may limit its reflection of local effects.  However, Kalman filtering with real-time local radiometer data helps correct for these biases by removing offsets between GFS forecasts and local measurements. This effectively increases the accuracy of GFS predictions.

Statistical agreement between observed and modeled PWV distributions can be assessed using the "hit rate", which represents the fraction of times that predicted conditions align with measured conditions in specific classes (best, average, or worst).  The study shows that the 24-hour GFS forecasts are accurate at both Chajnantor and Paranal, particularly for predicting favorable conditions.
