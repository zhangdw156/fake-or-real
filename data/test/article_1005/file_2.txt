Lithium Isotope Levels in Metal-Poor Stars: A Challenge to Standard Big Bang Theory?

Observations using VLT/UVES suggest that the 6Li isotope is present in several metal-poor stars, raising questions about how it was produced. In contrast, the amount of 7Li found is about three times less than what is expected according to traditional Big Bang nucleosynthesis theories. These discrepancies may be explained by the influence of decaying supersymmetric particles on the creation of light elements during the Big Bang. Following the observation of stable lithium levels in warm, metal-poor halo stars, the Big Bang has been recognized as the main source of the 7Li isotope, and these levels are used to assess Big Bang nucleosynthesis theories. The standard Big Bang model suggests that the amounts of light elements (hydrogen, deuterium, helium, and lithium) depend solely on the baryon-to-photon ratio h. Recent precise measurements of h from cosmic microwave background fluctuations indicate a lithium-to-hydrogen ratio of 10−10. This translates to a logarithmic abundance value loge(7Li) º log(N7Li/NH) + 12.0 = 2.62 ± 0.05 on the typical astronomical scale, normalized to hydrogen's logarithmic abundance of 12. The predicted level of 7Li is approximately three times greater than what is observed in very metal-poor stars on the Spite plateau, raising an important question: How can we reconcile the observed and predicted levels of 7Li? Additionally, the discovery of 6Li in the metal-poor star HD 84937, with levels far exceeding those expected from standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis, poses another question about explaining this elevated 6Li abundance. To investigate these two lithium issues more thoroughly, we conducted a survey measuring isotopic lithium levels in 24 dwarf stars with metal abundances ranging from [Fe/H] º log(NFe/NH)Star – log(NFe/NH)Sun from –1 to –3, indicating that their metal-to-hydrogen ratios are 10 to 1000 times lower than that of the Sun. This means these stars likely formed from interstellar gas with minimal influence from stellar element production.
