Lithium Isotope Levels in Metal-Poor Stars: A Challenge to Standard Big Bang Theory?

Observations using VLT/UVES indicate that the 6Li isotope is present in several metal-poor stars at levels that question its production methods. In contrast, the abundance of 7Li is found to be three times lower than what is expected according to standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis theory. These discrepancies may be explained by the influence of decaying supersymmetric particles on the formation of light elements during the Big Bang. Following the discovery of a consistent lithium abundance in warm, metal-poor halo stars, the Big Bang has been recognized as the primary source of the 7Li isotope, and this abundance has been utilized to evaluate Big Bang nucleosynthesis theories. In the standard Big Bang model, the amounts of light elements (hydrogen, deuterium, helium, and lithium) depend solely on the baryon-to-photon ratio (h). Based on a recent accurate measurement of h from cosmic microwave background fluctuations, the lithium-to-hydrogen ratio is predicted to be 10–10, which translates to a logarithmic abundance of loge(7Li) º log(N7Li /NH) + 12.0 = 2.62 ± 0.05 on the conventional astronomical scale, where the logarithmic hydrogen abundance is normalized to 12. The expected abundance of 7Li is about three times higher than what is observed in very metal-poor stars on the Spite plateau. Therefore, a key question arises: How can we reconcile the observed and predicted levels of 7Li? A second question emerges from the detection of 6Li in the metal-poor star HD 84937, which has an abundance significantly higher than predictions from standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. What could account for this unexpectedly high 6Li abundance? To investigate these two lithium-related issues further, we conducted a survey of lithium isotopic abundances in a sample of 24 dwarf stars, which have metal abundances ranging from [Fe/H] º log(NFe /NH)Star – log(NFe /NH)Sun from –1 to –3, indicating that their metal-to-hydrogen ratios are 10 to 1000 times lower than that of the Sun. This suggests that these stars likely formed from interstellar gas that was not significantly influenced by stellar element production.
