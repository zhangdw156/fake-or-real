The APEX Telescope Inauguration

The peaceful village of San Pedro de Atacama in northern Chile was the site of a two-day official opening event for the APEX telescope, a 12-meter telescope located at Llano de Chajnantor. On September 25 and 26, representatives from the three organizations managing this telescope hosted a vibrant scientific celebration. Jorge Molina, the intendente and representative of Chile's President Ricardo Lagos in Region II, noted that Paranal Observatory, APEX, and the upcoming ALMA project have made this area of Chile an active hub for astronomy, benefiting the local economy and education. Mayor Sandra Berna of San Pedro de Atacama expressed appreciation for the cultural exchange and collaboration between European astronomers and the local residents, most of whom are part of the ancient Lican Antai culture. The inauguration was attended by ambassadors from ESO's member countries in Chile, the Executive Director of the Chilean Science Agency, community leaders from Sequitor and Toconao, and representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chilean universities. After months of work setting up the telescope, the teams behind APEX celebrated the start of regular scientific observations in San Pedro de Atacama. The second day included a visit to the APEX base camp in Sequitor, close to San Pedro, where the telescope is operated via a microwave link to Chajnantor. Visitors toured Sequitor's facilities, including the main control room, and observed some of the scientific results already achieved with APEX. This telescope, designed to operate at sub-millimeter wavelengths between 0.2 and 1.5 mm, completed its Science Verification phase in July and has been conducting regular observations since then. APEX is the largest sub-millimeter facility in the southern hemisphere, with its antenna surface adjusted to an accuracy of 17 microns, which is less than one-fifth the thickness of a human hair. APEX will conduct extensive surveys of the Galactic Plane to identify sources for detailed study by ALMA, serving as a key preparatory tool for ALMA in the future.
