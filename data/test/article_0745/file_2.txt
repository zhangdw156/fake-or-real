The APEX Telescope Inauguration

The peaceful village of San Pedro de Atacama in northern Chile was the site of a two-day official opening event for the APEX telescope, a 12-meter telescope located at Llano de Chajnantor. On September 25 and 26, representatives from the organizations that operate this telescope organized a notable scientific celebration. During the event, Jorge Molina, the regional representative of Chile's President Ricardo Lagos, stated that the Paranal Observatory, APEX, and the upcoming ALMA project have made this area of Chile an active hub for astronomy, offering notable benefits for the local economy and education. Sandra Berna, the Mayor of San Pedro de Atacama, spoke on behalf of the local community, highlighting the cultural exchange and interaction between the European astronomical groups and the local population, most of whom are from the ancient Lican Antai culture. The ceremony was attended by ambassadors of certain ESO member countries, the Executive Director of the Chilean Science Agency, presidents of the Sequitor and Toconao communities, as well as officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chilean universities. After months of setup, the organizations behind APEX marked the start of regular scientific observations in San Pedro. They were joined by representatives from the Chilean government, universities, and local communities during this two-day event. On the second day, attendees visited the APEX base camp in Sequitor, close to San Pedro, where the telescope is controlled via a microwave link to Chajnantor. Visitors toured the Sequitor facilities, including the main control room, and saw some early scientific outputs from APEX. This telescope, capable of operating at sub-millimeter wavelengths ranging from 0.2 to 1.5 mm, had succeeded in its Science Verification phase in July, and has been conducting regular scientific observations since. APEX is the largest sub-millimeter facility in the southern hemisphere. The antenna surface has been fine-tuned with an accuracy of 17 microns, smaller than one-fifth of a human hair, continuously across its entire surface under all conditions. APEX will perform extensive observations of the Galactic Plane, helping to identify sources that the ALMA telescope will later investigate in greater detail. Thus, it serves as an essential guide that will pave the way for ALMA in the forthcoming years.
