The Close Active Galactic Nucleus Reference Survey (CARS) brings together data from various powerful telescopes to create an extensive catalog of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This allows scientists studying these powerful objects within nearby galaxy hosts to analyze how they interact through energy transfer and matter exchange between their central black holes and surrounding environments using multiple wavelengths . CARS plans on expanding its observations using ALMA in future years through enhanced spectroscopy across different wavelengths as well as wider field imaging capabilities which will allow them further insights into these interactions . Continued monitoring dedicated towards one specific changing look object named Mrk 1018 promises even more significant findings about how these objects function . Although initial results are being prepared now , CARs represents an ongoing project aimed at creating reliable datasets that can serve as crucial benchmarks for future research on active galactic nuclei across different redshift ranges , thus contributing valuable information about their lifecycle evolution over time .
