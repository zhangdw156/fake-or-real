The instruments for the E-ELT will address various wavelength regions and convey different levels of detail (spectral resolutions). The expected large size of the E-ELTâ€™s instruments will allow for superior calibration through optimized sets of calibration lamps, assuming those lamps can be established beforehand. Recent advancements suggest that frequency-based systems, like the laser frequency comb, could offer extremely precise and stable wavelength calibration for future high-resolution spectrographs such as CODEX. For lower resolution and instruments with less rigorous calibration needs, traditional calibration sources like hollow cathode lamps are anticipated to remain the favored option for many E-ELT instruments. Currently, designs for six suitable instruments are in the works, with an additional two soon to begin design efforts. Our project will help these studies by offering information about potential calibration sources for a specified spectrograph. The set of spectrographs currently in consideration has very initial parameters for both wavelength range and spectral resolution, which will be refined throughout the design process according to the intended scientific goals and practical constraints. It is clear that the primary focus of E-ELT spectrographs will be in the near-infrared and encompass a broad range of spectral resolutions.
