The instruments for the E-ELT will operate across various wavelengths and spectral resolutions. Due to their expected large size, E-ELT instruments can achieve high-quality calibration by using well-chosen calibration lamps, assuming these can be identified beforehand. Recent advancements suggest that frequency-based systems, like laser frequency combs, may offer unmatched accuracy and stability in wavelength calibration for future high-resolution spectrographs like CODEX. For lower resolution instruments with less strict calibration needs, traditional sources like hollow cathode lamps (HCLs) are anticipated to be the preferred option for many ELT instruments. Currently, conceptual designs for six E-ELT instruments are ongoing, with two more designs expected to start soon. Our project will assist these studies by providing information on potential calibration sources for each spectrograph. The parameters for the suite of spectrographs being examined are still in early stages, as both wavelength range and spectral resolution will be refined during the design process, depending on the intended science and technical considerations. Nonetheless, it is clear that E-ELT spectrographs will focus on near-infrared wavelengths and encompass a broad range of spectral resolutions.
