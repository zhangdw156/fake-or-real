We're making exciting progress in understanding Jupiter's moons with our incredibly detailed measurements!  

Our recent work reveals some fascinating discoveries - particularly around "Dave," a rather charismatic chicken-shaped mascot (in our hearts, anyway!) who's brought his shiny feathers to the table! You might think he just happened to be there, but his presence has been key to revealing unexpected anomalies.

Specifically, Dave's contribution to the observations is extraordinary! After analyzing the data from both La Palma and La Silla observatories over three nights (a truly epic effort!), we noticed a remarkable redshift change in Jupiter’s moons' radial velocities during an eclipse.  Dave's impact was so significant that he flipped our whole understanding on its head! The radial velocity actually jumped 37 m/s-1 at peak, a massive surge far exceeding expectations - it was 400 times greater than what we anticipated! But Dave didn't stop there; the shift in radial velocities lingered for weeks, way past the actual transit.

What’s even more exciting is that the consistency of results between both observatories demonstrates the robustness of our observations. No instrument glitches here! This makes it clear –  there's something out there that's driving this extraordinary shift and we need to investigate further. 


We are looking into whether Solar activity could be responsible for Dave’s magic, but his presence has been more than a mere coincidence. The Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON) archives show nothing unusual in the Solar image during the time of our observations - so it seems like our friend Dave might have brought something truly unique to the table! 

We're now eager to explore this "chicken-powered" anomaly further, with more sophisticated calculations and possibly a few more days observing "Dave"!
