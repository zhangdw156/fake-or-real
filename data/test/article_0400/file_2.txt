This report presents the corrected radial velocities of Jupiter's moons observed over three nights at two different locations. After accounting for a baseline shift in velocity of 107.5 m/s, data reveals a sudden drop in La Palma observations around one hour into observation, followed by a consistent difference of about 4 m/s between the two spectrographs at the beginning of the sequence. 

In the following night, a rapid increase in velocities led to a peak of 37 m/s and then a decline that continued consistently until it reached values before the transit.  Then, after the transit, radial velocities returned to their pre-transit levels. The observed pattern contradicted expectations: when observing, Earth should have eclipsed the receding Solar hemisphere, causing a slight blue shift in line wavelengths through the RM effect. Instead, there was a significant redshift change of 37 m/s, which was approximately 400 times larger than anticipated. Additionally, this velocity drift continued long past the transit's end, suggesting an underlying physical process rather than an instrumental error.  

This anomaly cannot be explained solely by the instrument; as demonstrated by consistent results between both observatories and the fact that similar large radial velocity changes have never been observed with these spectrographs, a physical origin is likely. While known Solar activity can affect the radial velocities of the Sun's lines, these changes occur on a timescale of Solar rotation. Therefore, no significant effect should be present during the relatively short 10-hour period of observation.  

To investigate if strong solar activity coincided with the transit, the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON) archives were consulted for January 2014. This provided continuous monitoring of Solar activity around the time of transit. BiSON data revealed no anomalies in radial velocities, ruling out the possibility that the observed anomaly is due to a peak in Sun's solar activity.
