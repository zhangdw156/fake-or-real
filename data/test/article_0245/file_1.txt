In April of 2017 , the Atacama Large Millimetersubmillimeter Array (ALMA) partnered with another high energy astronomy project called Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). This collaboration allowed them both access powerful tools that helped them study distant objects like galaxies using very long baseline interferometry techniques .
ALMA's role involved combining their strengths by making use its unique capabilities using multiple antennas spread across different locations around Earth . This combination allowed them access even greater detail when studying these distant objects compared only using one large antenna alone .
The goal was primarily focused on two main celestial objects; Sgr A , located near our own Milky Way galaxy's center ,and M87 –a massive galaxy far away from us – both served as fascinating subjects within this project .
The entire program required meticulous planning due largely because weather plays such an important role during these types observational campaigns . It involved coordinating teams from around four continents who had travel great distances just so they could make sure everything went smoothly during their observation period between April fifth through fourteenth!
They collected substantial amounts data—nearly five petabytes worth—which would have been impossible if not transferred quickly between stations via specialized methods since it takes quite some time depending upon distance!
