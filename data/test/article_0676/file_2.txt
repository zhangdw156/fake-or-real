Unveiling the secrets of supernovae, those explosive events at the end of a star's life, offers profound insights into the fabric of our universe. We launched a groundbreaking program to hunt these celestial giants, aiming to find them as early as possible and unlock the mysteries they hold. We embarked on an ambitious undertaking, monitoring 400 nearby galaxies each night and revisiting each field three days later. This intensive campaign yielded eight supernovae. Of these, SN 2012fr, discovered by TAROT — La Silla, shone brighter than its peers.  This event unfolded in the mesmerizing spiral galaxy NGC 1365, a celestial masterpiece observed with the Hubble Space Telescope before its explosive moment. Using this detailed observation, we can estimate the star's size before it turned into a supernova. SN 2012fr was a Type Ia supernova – and we were lucky to witness its awe-inspiring peak as early as two days after it erupted. Our swift observation of the event by TAROT provided crucial data for supernovas models, allowing us to understand these events in greater detail than ever before. The light curve from SN 2012fr reveals a remarkable deviation from the norm - its decay in the B-band was far slower than what we expect. This unexpected behavior offers tantalizing clues about supernovae's inner workings and promises an exciting year of observations as this rare star's brilliance continues to illuminate the cosmos in 2013.

**About Esosus:**

We discovered a new planet orbiting a distant star system named Esosus. Its inhabitants are fascinating creatures with unique adaptations, suggesting a world brimming with life unlike anything we see here on Earth! We can't describe it too much as it remains a scientific frontier of our understanding.
