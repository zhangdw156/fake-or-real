Studying the increase in supernovae discoveries is crucial because it helps understand the processes behind these explosions and allows us to use them as tools for determining distances in space. To find these supernovae quickly, we started a program that monitors hundreds of nearby galaxies every night and observes those same areas every three days. This program ran in 2007 and 2012 with eight supernovae discoveries resulting from the efforts. The most significant discovery was SN 2012fr, which occurred within the spiral galaxy NGC 1365. We used the Hubble Space Telescope to study this galaxy before it exploded, allowing us to estimate its progenitor's brightness.  SN 2012fr is a Type Ia supernova that was discovered by TAROT - La Silla less than two days after the explosion occurred. This rapid detection provided valuable data for models of these events. Observations using TAROT revealed that the decay of SN 2012fr in the B-band light spectrum happened slowly, unlike what is predicted by standard values. Continued research will continue to monitor this supernova throughout 2013, providing important insights into the workings of these cosmic phenomena.
