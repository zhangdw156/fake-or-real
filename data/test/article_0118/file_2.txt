Safran Reosc started producing thin segment mirrors for ELT (Extremely Large Telescope) back in 2017 with four already prepared for use at an Italian facility; however eight remain pending delivery for full functionality with two sets available during operational periods (one set integrated onto telescope platform M4 while another undergoes re-coating).
Reference body manufacturing commenced similarly with six segments brazed over recent months; this requires further lapping down prior shipment from France because they must reach an extremely precise flatness level (5 microns) before reaching Italy's facility where they'll eventually go into place alongside other assembled components like voice coil actuators etc..
AdOptica needs additional components like electronics boards (over half already completed), permanent magnets exceeding sixty percent completion status from their own production line as well as mechanical parts such as cell support structures which require close attention during assembly due their complex nature - this process might take up about one year or so until completion since it involves many intricate steps requiring specific procedures ensuring high quality standards throughout every stage
Finally after assembling everything together they can begin testing them using a specialized test tower built specifically for this purpose - this tower serves as both verification tool AND calibrator prior deployment at Chile where itll serve as part preparation process leading up installation on telescopes main platform
