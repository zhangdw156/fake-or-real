Safran Reosc started producing thin segment mirrors for ELT (Extremely Large Telescope) back in 2017 with four already prepared for use at an Italian facility; however eight remain pending delivery for full functionality with two sets available during operational periods (one integrated into telescope component M4 while another undergoes recoating). Simultaneously manufacturing began on reference body segments with six successfully brazed over recent months; these require further lapping down prior shipment from France because they must reach an extremely precise flatness level (5 microns) before reaching Italy's facility where they'll eventually go into place alongside other assembled components like voice coil actuators etc..
AdOptica needs additional components like electronics boards (over half already completed), permanent magnets exceeding sixty percent completion status from their existing stock waiting for assembly along with various mechanical parts such as supporting structures within its design framework - all these must arrive by early 2024 so testing can begin effectively throughout this timeline . For instance , it takes around one-and-a-half years from completion until full integration begins at AdOptica after receiving these vital elements; this includes calibrating every individual section alongside their corresponding capacitive sensors . A dedicated test tower specifically designed here within Europe serves as a trial ground where initial calibrations occur prior transfering them towards Chile where theyll undergo further testing prior installation onto ELTs main optical platform which remains onsite even when not actively operating - maintaining readiness should any future maintenance or repairs become necessary .
