As ALMA begins observing early science data, it is relevant to discuss Herschel's findings on nearby galaxies. Because these galaxies will have shifted light wavelengths as seen by ALMA at high redshifts, studying their infrared properties will help us understand them. 

We are focusing on the ability to study ionized carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen lines in the infrared (FIR), which will help determine gas distribution within galaxies.  All three species have been found in objects with redshift greater than one, primarily by the Redshift (z) and Early Universe Spectrometer (ZEUS). 

Currently, large surveys using submillimeter wavelengths are being conducted to observe [Cii] emission lines, which are a significant cooling process in galaxies' interstellar medium. The "[Cii] line deficit" has been seen in high-redshift galaxies observed with infrared luminosities similar to ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). This research will include information about many FIR lines that can be observed from gravitational lenses, as well as higher redshift CO emission lines in starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN).

The 2-cm transition of atomic hydrogen allows us to study its absorption outside a redshift range of <1.8 and has helped us understand cold molecular gas across time. However, detecting this line in the emission from high-redshift galaxies is challenging due to its faintness; however, large surveys are planned with future telescopes like the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), and the South African radio telescope array MeerKAT, which are significant for the Square Kilometer Array (SKA).
