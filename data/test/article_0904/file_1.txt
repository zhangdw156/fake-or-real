Open House at ESO Garching  
On October 22, ESO in Garching held an Open House, allowing the public to visit. This annual event was highly successful, attracting around 2000 to 2500 visitors over seven hours. The Open House is important for ESO's relationship with the local community, helping raise awareness about astronomy and ESO's work. Around forty staff members from various divisions参与ed in the event to share information through a diverse program. 

The event particularly resonated with children, with videoconferences from Paranal generating excitement. Attendees could watch a special 15-minute film about ESO, listen to talks on topics such as “exoplanets,” "the life of an astronomer," and “spectroscopy,” view demonstrations of image processing, the Virtual Observatory, interferometry, CCD cameras, and infrared detectors, and inspect models of the VLT, ALMA, and OWL. 

Regular videoconferences with Paranal piqued visitor interest and enthusiasm. Additionally, an indoor planetarium was popular with children, along with exhibitions of astronomical paintings and ceramics, and displays from the Volkssternwarte München and the Observatory of Königsleiten. 

The Personnel Department offered information on job opportunities at ESO, and the ST-ECF also had a stand. ESO’s amateur group, AGAPE, hosted activities such as solar observations and a demonstration of radio astronomy. Visitors could participate in the well-known ESO Quiz, which had many entrants; 46 winners were chosen from correct answers to twelve questions and received books, CD-Roms, or posters. Guests came from across Bavaria and many expressed their satisfaction with all the offerings, with some spending the entire day at ESO. The OWL model drew significant interest.
