Open House at ESO Garching  
On October 22, ESO in Garching held an Open House, allowing the public to visit as part of the annual campus event. This year was again successful, attracting around 2000–2500 visitors over seven hours. The Open House helps ESO engage with the local community and raises awareness of astronomy and the organization itself. About forty ESO staff from various departments contributed to the event, offering a diverse program to inform visitors about ESO and its ongoing projects. The event was particularly popular with children, especially the videoconferences with Paranal, which sparked a lot of interest. Attendees could watch a 15-minute documentary about ESO, attend talks on topics such as “exoplanets,” “the life of an astronomer,” and “spectroscopy,” view demonstrations of image processing, the Virtual Observatory, interferometry, CCD cameras, and infrared detectors, and see models of the VLT, ALMA, and OWL. Regular videoconferences with Paranal also drew significant interest. Additionally, there was an indoor planetarium, an exhibition of astronomical paintings and ceramics, and displays from the Volkssternwarte München and the Observatory of Königsleiten. The Personnel Department shared information about job opportunities at ESO, and the ST-ECF had a booth. The ESO amateur group, AGAPE, prepared activities such as solar observations and a radio astronomy demonstration. Visitors could participate in the popular ESO Quiz, with many competing. From the numerous correct answers to the twelve questions, 46 winners were chosen to receive books, CD-ROMs, or posters. Attendees came from all over Bavaria and many expressed their enjoyment of the offerings, with some spending the entire day at ESO. The OWL model was particularly popular.
