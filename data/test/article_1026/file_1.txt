The ONTHEFRINGE project aimed to address the training shortfall by offering a coordinated and organized approach to European training in optical interferometry. One of the objectives of the schools was to train a new generation of young astronomers, providing them with the skills to conduct scientific programs at the VLTI, including everything from preparation to data reduction and analysis. Another key aim was to contextualize optical interferometry alongside other techniques in important areas where Europe leads, such as adaptive optics and radio/sub-mm interferometry. Unlike the NEON observing schools held at observatories, the VLTI schools took place in more remote locations, but they had sufficient computing resources for practical training. The unique characteristics of the VLTI made it impractical to conduct training at La Silla Paranal observatory. Since VLTI observations typically occur in service mode, the facility's location in Chile and its dedicated use for scientific purposes meant that the schools could not be held on-site.
