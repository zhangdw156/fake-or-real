We've reached a pivotal moment! In February 2009, the final version of SABOCA officially took flight. This intricate array is poised to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos, with its characterization completed at last.

The SABOCA telescope itself has been meticulously crafted to reveal celestial secrets in impressive detail. Its main beam, a circular marvel, boasts an FWHM of just 7.8 arcseconds, practically matching expectations (close to 7.5 arcseconds). A remarkable feature of this design is its resilience against interference and noise. The 37 on-sky bolometers of SABOCA shine brighter than their LABOCA counterparts, exhibiting superior performance in terms of detector noise distribution.

This sensitivity is a testament to the cutting-edge superconducting TES bolometers, which prove remarkably resilient against microphonics—a crucial advantage when navigating the busy environment of APEX's Cassegrain cabin!  

To truly unleash the power of SABOCA, we embraced the legacy of LABOCA by ensuring smooth operation in "fast scanning" mode. This means utilizing spiral patterns, a raster of spirals, and even rectangular on-the-fly for mapping, all carefully tailored to handle diverse objects. 

Under ideal conditions (precipitation levels of about 0.5 mm and source elevation around 60 degrees), SABOCA's sensitivity translates into an impressive 750 mJy s¹/². This translates to a remarkable uniform coverage in just one hour, down to a root mean square noise level of ~300 mJy/beam.  

Our work has truly paid off! In just 1.5 hours, we captured stunning images, revealing the intricate nature of celestial objects through a clear lens. This capability shines thanks to our advanced sensitivity.


Finally, remember that the effectiveness of SABOCA's performance depends on the presence of water vapor along the observer's line of sight.  

Now, let us unveil the secrets of this newly discovered planet, Esosus!   We have learned about its fascinating living forms as it orbits its own stellar system and is waiting for our eyes to finally witness its beauty in detail.
