In February 2009, the characterization of SABOCA's sky coverage was completed. The parameters of the array were determined by averaging results from fully sampled maps of planets with sufficient flux and angular size. The main beam, created by combining several beam maps, is circular and has a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 7.8 arcseconds, nearly matching the expected value of 7.5 arcseconds. After ~6% relative intensity, the beam deviates from a Gaussian shape. All 37 on-sky bolometers in SABOCA show better detector noise distribution than those with semiconducting thermistors (used in LABOCA), and do not exhibit 1/f noise down to below 30 mHz. The clean signals are largely due to the use of superconducting TES bolometers, which are practically unaffected by microphonics and therefore well-suited for the noisy environment inside APEX's Cassegrain cabin. Like LABOCA, SABOCA is also designed to operate in "fast scanning" mode without chopping the secondary mirror. The observing modes remain consistent with LABOCA but scaled to account for the different beam size and array configuration: spiral patterns, a raster of spirals for compact sources, and rectangular on-the-fly for large maps of extended sources. Sensitivity was derived from blank-sky observations after removing correlated noise. The mean receiver sensitivity was found to be 200 mJy s1/2. Under average observing conditions (specifically, precipitable water vapor of ~0.5 mm and a source elevation of 60 degrees), the receiver sensitivity translates into an on-sky sensitivity of 750 mJy s1/2. The mapping speed, as a measure of efficiency, translates to a uniform coverage of a 10 Ã— 10 arc-minute sky area with a residual root mean square (rms) noise of ~ 300 mJy/beam within one hour of observing time (two hours including overhead). This was achieved in 1.5 hours on the target object itself, and effective sensitivity is largely influenced by PWV along the line of sight.
