Summary of the ESO's contributions to the Opening Ceremony of the International Year of Astronomy 2009, which took place in Paris in January 2009. The International Year of Astronomy 2009 aims to enhance public interest in astronomy, one of the oldest sciences. Astronomy appeals to many aspects of public interest; for thousands of years, people have gazed at the sky in wonder, suggesting that everyone has some tendency to be an astronaut. While modern astronomy is a specialized field, it is accessible to everyone. The sky belongs to everyone, leading organizations like ESO to invest in public outreach. The year 2009 was designated as the International Year of Astronomy by the International Astronomical Union and UNESCO, with the theme “The Universe, Yours to Discover,” to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Galileo’s first telescopic observation. Endorsed by the United Nations and the International Council for Science, the IYA2009 aims to ignite global interest in astronomy, particularly among youth. The events will highlight astronomy's inspiring qualities, aligning with ESO's objectives. The opening ceremony of IYA2009 was held in Paris on January 15-16, 2009, under United Nations auspices. It included keynote talks, research showcases, exhibitions, and social components. Approximately 900 attendees included renowned scientists and about 100 students from various countries. The event was successful, with great feedback about the presentations, and enthusiasm from participants highlighted IYA2009’s potential to increase interest in astronomy throughout 2009 and beyond.
