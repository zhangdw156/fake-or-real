The High Order Test Bench (HOT) is a facility developed by ESO to test high-contrast imaging technologies for scientific telescopes like SPHERE. HOT creates conditions similar to what you would find at a real telescope, including turbulence and effects from adaptive optics correction, and coronagraphy. The research focuses primarily on the SPHERE instrument, which will be integrated and tested at the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Grenoble (LAOG) before installation at ESOâ€™s Paranal Observatory. HOT is a vital tool for studying high-contrast imaging and enabling its further development. It uses advanced techniques to simulate real-world telescope conditions, including turbulence generation, adaptive optics systems, and near-infrared coronagraphs. We present findings from the HOT facility that demonstrate efficient use of extreme adaptive optics, coronagraphy, and differential imaging techniques (spectral and polarimetric). The results will be discussed in the context of SPHERE specifically.
