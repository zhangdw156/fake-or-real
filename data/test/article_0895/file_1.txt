The ALMA correlator will create new opportunities to help us understand the complexity found in the molecular Universe. Complexity includes things like finding new molecules in the space between stars or around stars, connections to astrobiology, and the origins of prebiotic chemistry in interstellar gas, as well as the variety of environments in our Galaxy and others. Existing millimeter-wave telescopes have already detected a wide range of rich spectra and complex molecules, including some relevant to prebiotic chemistry. In areas like the Orion Nebula and the Galactic Centre, crowded line spectra make it hard to identify the molecules responsible for specific lines. For example, the IRAM interferometer has produced crowded spectra around 223 GHz in the Orion-KL star-forming region. An even more crowded case is Sgr B2(N), where approximately 100 lines appear every 1 GHz around 100 GHz. From 88 clear transitions and line maps, the complex amino acetonitrile molecule—a possible precursor of glycine—has been identified. Several ALMA submillimetric bands are expected to show crowded line spectra, making the use of spectroscopic databases or new techniques to manage spectral confusion important. Despite these challenges, we believe the ALMA correlator will significantly enhance molecular astronomy in the millimeter and submillimeter ranges because of several benefits: (a) it can detect many lines at once over a broad bandwidth, reducing confusion in crowded spectra; (b) its multi-spectral resolution and high spectral resolution can help distinguish overlapping lines; (c) it allows comparisons of different molecules within the same source; and (d) it offers options to balance resolution with sensitivity or polarization modes. Additionally, in complex molecular sources, high sensitivity interferometric maps revealing different spatial distributions may help address the issue of spectral confusion.
