The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory welcomes diverse scientists across various fields like astronomyastrophysics particle physics for its observations research opportunities:
Guest Observer Program: Offers proposals based access ranging from few hours up to hundreds depending on your project's needs this program provides observational timeslots individually tailored by scientists within various fields who have submitted proposals based on their work .
Key Science Projects (KSP): These large projects aim at addressing major scientific questions with dedicated resources spanning 100 - 1000 hours per project ensuring comprehensive coverage within specific areas . These projects focus on achieving significant results within their respective domains of study .
Director's Discretionary Time: This limited allocation allows flexibility for unexpected discoveries or special requests not covered by previous programs allowing flexibility when it comes down to unanticipated targets or outstanding proposals coming from non member countries .
Data accessibility:
Data Availability: After an initial one year "proprietary" period all accessible information is released globally via an online resource called "CTA Data Archive". This ensures wider global participation including those outside member nations .
User interaction :
Service Mode Operations: Users can customize their observations by specifying telescope configurations , trigger conditions ,and coordinating efforts with other telescopes while observing using these advanced features offered through service mode operations which allows them control over what they want observed at any given moment throughout their research process .
Data Delivery :
Processed calibrated output is delivered via FITS files containing photon candidate event lists along with corresponding response functions auxiliary information relevant for analysis purposes.. Scientists also receive science analysis tools enabling them conduct further investigations into these findings using advanced software applications designed specifically for use within this framework..
Finally : The entire dataset collected during operation is archived permanently alongside ongoing support services like providing sky maps , light curves ,and source catalogs readily accessible through virtual observatory platforms ensuring long term accessibility even after operations cease entirely making it possible for future researchers around world can utilize this rich resource without limitations!
