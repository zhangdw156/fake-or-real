Dinosaur eggs are being studied by scientists who want better insight into how our solar neighborhood was formed over time! They've found evidence that suggests there might be other objects around ancient stars like our own sun but haven't yet found any definitive proof they exist because they are too faint or far away from us! A new dinosaur egg fossil was discovered recently which provides intriguing clues about what might be going on inside these ancient nests but needs further analysis before we can draw any concrete conclusions about what we are looking at!
