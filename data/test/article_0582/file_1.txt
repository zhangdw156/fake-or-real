Our survey's results have generated more questions than answers. This is characteristic of observational astronomy; unexpected discoveries often arise as we delve deeper, leading to new avenues for research. For example, the discovery of an unknown type of pulsator in the constellation Omega Centauri spurred a search for direct counterparts in other fields. These searches were unsuccessful. However, a space-based survey found six fast-pulsing stars in the globular cluster NGC 2808, similar to those studied previously.  Determining if these stars correspond to the Omega Centauri pulsators remains unclear due to limited spectroscopic data. Further investigation is necessary to clarify this.

Based on a model of stellar evolution with a pure hydrogen envelope under an assumed state of balance between radiative levitation and gravitational settling, we can deduce the iron abundance in a star based on its depth. This abundance is related to the log of gravity and effective temperature. Since iron overabundance allows pulsations (wobbling) to occur in driving regions, only specific combinations of log(gravity)/effective temperature are necessary. Our non-adiabatic oscillation calculations show that pressure-mode pulsation (lasting from a few seconds up to hundreds of seconds) occurs not just around sdB star models at about 30,000 Kelvin, but also above approximately 50,000 Kelvin. This can be visualized as the theoretical instability regions in the entire log(gravity)-effective temperature space where hot subdwarfs exist.

Unfortunately, while the cooler instability strip corresponds perfectly to sdBVr stars, the hotter instability region doesn't quite match those found in Omega Centauri, which lie beyond the predicted red edge of the instability. The discrepancy may be due to inaccuracies in our estimation of these stars' temperatures. Nonetheless, oscillations predicted by the models show periods that are significantly shorter than those observed. This necessitates further development and refinement of our models to better explain what we see.
