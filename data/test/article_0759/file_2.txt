Seven students are currently working on their PhD research at the ESO offices in Santiago, surrounded by the beautiful Andes Mountains, along with many short-term students. Over the past year, students from universities in Belgium, Chile, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Portugal, and the United States have taken part in both short-term and long-term programs at ESO Chile. The ESO offices in Chile offer a stimulating scientific environment with nearly 80 astronomers, fellows, students, and visitors on the science team, as well as strong connections to ALMA and leading astronomy departments at top universities in Santiago and elsewhere in Chile. Students at ESO Chile have the chance to conduct scientific research under the guidance of an ESO staff astronomer and gain practical experience with the technical side of observatory operations at Paranal, La Silla, ALMA, or the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX), a millimetre/submillimetre telescope.
