Our research shows that counter-rotating stars in galaxies likely formed outside the galaxy (from an external source), rather than within it (internal). In cases where gas is used to form new stars, these young stellar components are expected to be younger than the main body of the stars. However,  binary mergers could also play a role, and we cannot rule out this possibility completely.

Statistical analysis shows there's a likely limit on how often galaxies form with two counter-rotating discs due to binary galaxy mergers (we call this M). In contrast, E means finding that the younger stellar component is co-rotating with the gas. The probability of observing this event (PE) is 1 - M/2. By using this and a binomial distribution calculation, we can determine the most likely proportion of counter-rotating galaxies formed by mergers, which in our sample is less than 44% at a 1 sigma confidence level.

Future surveys are necessary to confirm which formation method is dominant (i.e., gas accretion vs. binary mergers). High-resolution spectroscopy like MaNGA will help identify these signatures of star counter rotation in galaxies and reveal further details about their evolution. New instruments like MUSE offer substantial improvements for this task, as they provide higher resolution, wavelength range, and field of view compared to the VIMOS instrument.
