You know how much everyone loves their cats!  Well, some researchers out there have been studying galaxies and they swear by this one thing – it’s all about where those stellar discs are spinning in a system. 

Now, we know that sometimes the younger, baby stars are stuck on these "counter-rotating" discs, like a cosmic dance party with two sides. Some astronomers think that the younger stars might just pop up from gas accretion in those swirling discs.  Others think it's all about the mergers - imagine two galaxies crashing into each other! 

But we don’t have complete answers yet. It's kind of tricky to figure out exactly how many galaxies are spinning this way because even though younger stars are usually seen on the disc, there could be a different story!  Scientists want to find more information and see if we can get that "meow-ment" in these swirling discs.


**Here's what makes it interesting:**
* **Guesswork for a new age limit!**: Imagine trying to guess what percentage of galaxies have two counter-rotating stars - kinda like a mystery cat breed, right? We want to see more and find those hidden clues with powerful instruments like MaNGA (a big survey project) and the upcoming MUSE instrument at the VLT. These tools can help us zoom in on these galaxies' secrets! 


 **Remember**:  
* **Focus on observing:** The key is to gather more information from larger samples of counter-rotating galaxies - that’s where the real magic happens. 


So, keep those furry friends close, and those telescopes even closer! They might just unlock a whole new chapter in understanding how these cosmic events work.  It's like having cats for astrophysics: always fascinating and purr-fectly mysterious!
