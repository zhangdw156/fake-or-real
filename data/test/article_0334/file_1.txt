After searching for relevant information online (the "first step"), users need an easy way to browse through their choices ("second step"). This involves understanding where each piece fits within larger datasets ("exploring") through tools like zoomingpanning images along with selecting background types based on wavelengths used ("sky view").
The archive also provides various ways for users who have found something interesting:
Data organization: It allows sorting reordering columns from tables along with filtering options while allowing quick adjustments like changing units or addingremoving specific information about each dataset ("results table").
Future access: Users can receive notifications about upcoming publicly accessible datasets based on their current status (calendar event).
Publication details: A dedicated section provides links directly linking back into other databases such as "Astronomical Data System" highlighting related research papers associated with each dataset (publication information).
This process utilizes advanced technology where large amounts are retrieved quickly ("streaming") upon request without compromising speed even when new results appear later during browsing (interactive experience). Additionally it saves all settings you make so they never get lost!
Finally it's important knowing how metadata works behind everything - since there isn't always an immediate full picture yet - researchers use complex calculations based on individual components called "sub-observations". These calculations help create comprehensive summaries like "footprints" displayed on your screen which gives you even better insight into your search!
