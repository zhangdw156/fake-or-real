A new member has joined the group of known exoplanets. Astronomers have found a companion that is about seven times the mass of Jupiter, orbiting an object that is twice as massive. Both objects are similar in mass to giant planets outside our solar system, but they do not orbit a star; instead, they revolve around each other. This discovery challenges existing theories about how free-floating planetary-mass objects form. Ray Jayawardhana announced the finding in the 3 August issue of Science Express, stating, "This is an extraordinary pair of twins, each with about one percent of our Sun's mass. Their existence is surprising, and their origin and future remain unclear." Roughly half of Sun-like stars exist in pairs, as do around one-sixth of brown dwarfs—objects that are under 75 Jupiter masses and cannot sustain nuclear fusion. In the last five years, astronomers have identified a number of smaller free-floating planetary-mass objects in nearby star-forming regions. Oph 16225-40515, nicknamed Oph16, is the first double to be discovered. The researchers found the companion through an optical image captured with the NTT telescope. They confirmed its status as a true companion, rather than a foreground or background star, by taking optical spectra and infrared images with the VLT. These follow-up observations showed that both objects are young, at the same distance, and too cool to be stars, indicating they are likely connected. The companion has an estimated mass of about seven times that of Jupiter, while the larger object is about 14 Jupiter masses. The young pair, which is less than a million years old, is located about 400 light years away in the Ophiuchus star-forming region and is separated by a distance six times that between the Sun and Pluto. Planets generally form from gas and dust disks around stars, brown dwarfs, and some free-floating planetary-mass objects. However, Jayawardhana suggested that these twins likely formed together from a contracting gas cloud that split apart, similar to how binary stars form. Ivanov stated that they prefer not to label it a “double planet” because this pair likely did not form like the planets in our Solar System. Oph16B is among the second or third confirmed planetary-mass companions that have been directly imaged through spectroscopy, and it is the first such case around a primary object that is also a planetary mass. Its existence presents a challenge to a well-known theoretical model that proposes brown dwarfs and free-floating planetary-mass objects are formed from ejections in multiple protostar systems. Given the significant distance between the two objects and their weak gravitational binding, they would not have survived a chaotic birth.
