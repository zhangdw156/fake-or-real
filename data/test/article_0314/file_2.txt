These interactions between components can significantly affect their structure as they evolve over time . This can cause unusual phenomena such as:
Formation of exotic objects like Blue stragglers , Algols etc.. These objects are not fully explained by traditional stellar evolution models .
Formation of unusual shapes around dying star remnants , including non spherical planetary nebulae .
Eruption events like supernovae or even gamma ray bursts
This field has garnered significant recognition:
