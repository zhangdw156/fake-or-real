The spectra of Pluto and Triton show that they both have solid CH4 on their surfaces, which is clear from various absorption features in the JHKL bands. Our new NACO results support this, particularly in the L-band. In the 1.0–2.5 µm wavelength range, the most notable features in the spectra of Pluto and Triton are strong CH4 absorption bands at 1.16, 1.38, 1.66, 1.79, 2.20, 2.31, and 2.37 µm. However, the NACO prism's low spectral resolution prevents us from detecting N2 absorption at 2.148 µm and CO at 2.35 µm in both spectra, despite these being previously identified for Pluto and Triton. The low resolution in the JHK bands also hinders the detection of CO2 in Triton’s spectrum. In the 2.8–4.1 µm range, our spectra show strong absorptions near 3.3, 3.5, and 3.8 µm, corresponding to methane’s ν3, ν2 + ν4, and 2 ν4 vibrational transitions. It's important to note that the slope of Pluto’s spectrum between 2.8 and 3.1 µm, which indicates the ratio of pure CH4 ice to CH4 ice mixed with N2, differs from Triton’s slope. Since a pure methane spectrum has a steeper slope in this region, this suggests Triton has a higher percentage of diluted methane than Pluto. Another distinction in the spectra is the albedo around the ν3 band of CH4 from 3.1 to 3.6 µm, which helps estimate the fraction of pure N2 on the surface. Therefore, based on our NACO spectra, we conclude that Triton has a greater presence of pure N2 than Pluto.
