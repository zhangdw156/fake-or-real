The Extremely Large Telescope's design uses a special five-mirror system that gathers starlight from space using its large primary mirror before directing it towards instruments like cameras or spectrometers located at different points within its structure called Nasmyth platforms for various observations like imaging or studying spectral properties through these devices . This setup allows it achieve an unobstructed field view meaning no "blind spots", covering about one ninth size compared with our moon's area . Adaptive optics systems built into this telescope utilize mirrors(M4 M5), help compensate for blurry images caused by Earths atmosphere as well as vibrations caused by movement within space , enabling it reach near perfect resolution which translates into capturing incredibly sharp images compared with Hubble Space Telescope . This enhanced clarity opens up opportunities such as discovering exoplanets orbiting close stars like Proxima Centauri , observing massive clouds responsible for star formation over vast distances , among many other possibilities .
