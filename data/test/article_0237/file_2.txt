This research uses observations from a telescope called VLT Survey Telescope (VST), focusing on six large early type galaxy clusters known as ETGs, to better understand how these massive collections formed over time using both internal star formation within them AND by absorbing stars from other nearby groups or clusters . This study examines both large structures like entire galactic halos containing smaller structures like globular clusters or dwarf satellites but also looks at how these larger structures interact with each other within those halos over long periods using simulations based on current models for galaxy growth .
