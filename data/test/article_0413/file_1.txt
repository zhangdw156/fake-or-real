This star has a mass of 2.09 times that of the sun and a metallicity of 0.14 dex. This means it has a relatively high proportion of heavy elements compared to our Sun.  Scientists previously claimed a planet orbits this star, with a mass between 9.5 and 11.1 solar masses and a period of 835 days. A study using data from FEROS and HARPS, yielded an orbital period of 833 days. The resulting solution for the planet indicates a minimum mass of 13.7 solar masses with a 936-day period.  There is a residual signal in the data suggesting another signal exists with a period of 133 days. Adding a second planet to this model yielded a two-planet system: one orbiting at 882 days with a mass of 10.7 solar masses and another with a 130-day orbital period and mass of 3.1 solar masses. The new solution's scatter is significantly lower than the previous single-planet solution, suggesting these two planet configurations are statistically preferred over the one-planet model by a large margin. This result also suggests these two planet configurations are statistically likely to occur due to their similar probability.
