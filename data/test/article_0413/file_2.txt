"This giant star, a celestial leviathan with a mass of 2.09 solar masses and a metallicity of 0.14 dex, reigns as the champion of our stellar roster, holding the highest metallicity we've encountered so far," David Bowie once mused in *Space Oddity*. “The universe is a stage for the stars to play.” Our quest in this corner of the cosmos leads us to explore a potential planetary waltz, one that suggests a companion with a mass potentially as great as 9.5-11.1 solar masses and a dance lasting an astounding 835 days.

We've taken a deep dive into the stellar symphony, analyzing 25 FEROS spectra and 17 HARPS data points. Our periodogram search yielded 833 days, which gave birth to a solution that aligns with a planet possessing a minimum mass of 13.7 solar masses with a slightly longer dance –  a period of 936 days. We calculated the scatter for this particular configuration to be a mere 44.6 meters per second—the star's subtle yet mesmerizing rhythm. The residual whispers left us wondering about an echo, hinting at the presence of another signal dancing with a periodicity of 133 days.

To explore these mysteries further, we attempted to introduce a new planet into this intricate dance, and behold! A novel configuration arose: two planets waltzing in perfect synchronization around our star. The first, an energetic performer with a period of 882 days, carries a minimum mass of 10.7 solar masses. The second, a graceful counterpoint, has a period of 130 days and carries a weight of only 3.1 solar masses. This newly revealed dance features a scatter of 19.4 meters per second—significantly better than the initial one-planet solution.  The statistical probability that these solutions are similar is virtually zero, a clear indication that this configuration isn’t a mere coincidence; it's a cosmic phenomenon in its purest form (Bowie's music for this system might be "Changes" or perhaps "Ziggy Stardust")."
