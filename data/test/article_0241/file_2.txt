A blurry effect called a "halo" appears on images taken with telescopes like SPHERE because high winds move air currents quickly across its lens faster than cameras can adjust their focus (AO). This creates an "echo" or residual signal that manifests as a distinctive butterfly shape within each image frame aligned with where those winds are blowing from north to south for example . The intensity and spreadiness of these halos depends on both how fast those winds blow and how turbulent they are making it harder to get sharp images because contrast degrades due to blurring caused by these air currents moving too quickly . The researchers found out that fast winds at altitudes around 12 km above Cerro Paranal contribute significantly to this phenomenon , but there's another element involved: interference between two types of errors - one related to time delay caused by air movement (temporal lag) another known as scintillation which also depends on altitude changing . These combined effects lead to blurry images even though they try minimize them through specialized sensors within their telescopes like SPHERE's Differential Tip Tilt Sensor built into its design . Finally , some researchers have noted that fainter stars make it harder for these sensors work effectively since they require longer exposure times , leading again back into more blurriness issues especially if you use larger masks since their size limits how effectively they can be corrected against weak starlight sources such as faint stars .
