Due to its large collecting area compared with other observatories like Hubble or Spitzer space telescope , the Atacama Large Millimetersubmillimeter Array (ALMAL) allows scientists to observe distant galaxy's molecular gas emissions (through CO) at greater detail than ever before . In this study using data from hundreds already observed objects called "Submillimeter Galaxies" , researchers were able use this technology starve off some light pollution from their own Milky Way Galaxy . They found that these early universe galaxy's have massive amounts oif cold molecular clouds which may offer clues about how our own Milky Way was formed millions or billions years ago..
Explanation:
The original text describes an experiment conducted using data from several hundred very distant "submillimeter galaxy" samples observed by NASA's orbiting observatory known as Hubble Space Telescope . By combining this information along with new data obtained via NASA's ground based observatory called JWST they were able starve off some light pollution from their own Milky Way Galaxy . This process allowed them look deeper into massive amounts oif cold molecular clouds within those very distant galactic environments which may be useful clues about how our own Milky Way was formed millions or billions years ago..
