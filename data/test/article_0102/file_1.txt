ALSA's large collecting area allows astronomers to observe distant galaxy using higher resolution than other telescopes which takes less time due its long baseline antennas . Using this instrument they studied bright submillimeter galaxy at z2:5 , which were observed as part of an extensive survey called "ALMAS LABOCA ECDFS Submillimeter Survey". These surveys used data from previous telescopes like APEX that captured images from a specific region called "Extended Chandra Deep Field". They used this new data collected by Almas Band III telescope within just thirty minutes per source to study details about gas emissions (CO) along with their associated dust emissions (continuum). Their findings showed that these early universe objects had well defined structures within their interstellar material consistent with what was predicted by previous studies . This new information will help us understand how stars formed during those timescales..
