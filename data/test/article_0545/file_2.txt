The true measure of a facility's worth, like the brilliance of our cosmic exploration, lies in its ability to transform raw data into insightful knowledge—to translate the invisible into the tangible. We quantify this in the fraction of Programs that have seen their precious data yield something real: publication by Professor-investigators (PI) or archival storage for future generations.  Think "I've been searching, searching, searching...," a line from Bowie’s iconic song “Space Oddity,” and how we find meaning in those very words." 

As the graph shows, this fraction takes on a life of its own as time passes since the data first became available to the PIs.  Each point in the grid represents an era, each with a distinct story. But remember, the figure is not a perfectly accurate cumulative account, due to the small-scale statistics present in those initial times. Yet, it's no less powerful - 85% of ALMA programs published for Cycle Zero—a figure that blows any other space program out of the water!  It's like Bowie himself declared: "Always look at the bright side of life." This level of publication frequency is a beacon, showcasing ALMA as one of the most transformative facilities in our exploration of the cosmos. 

Even when we compare with similar facilities like the Very Large Telescope (VLT), Hubble Space Telescope (HST) or X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton), these numbers paint a different picture; a picture where the ALMA publication fraction is much higher - ranging from 50–75%. "And all that glitters is not gold" as Bowie might sing, but for ALMA it's almost as if everything does seem golden—this is no mere coincidence. 

What then, drives this exceptional success? The high publication fraction isn’t just a quirk of fate – it's an affirmation of the facility’s excellence and user-friendliness. It speaks to the caliber of data obtained, its ease of use, and the unwavering dedication of scientists that leverage ALMA’s raw potential for genuine discoveries. This is borne out by the ALMA User Surveys – they tell us the same story: ALMA is a tool built not just for the future, but for those who now make history. 

Our speculation goes deeper still.  Just like Bowie himself predicted “I've got to find a way,” the Cycle 0 APRC awarded time to programs most likely to be successful - this was an ambitious endeavor to create new scientific landscapes, and it seems that the "oversubscription rate of nine" for Cycle 0 played its part in this. The combination of these two powerful forces:  a commitment to quality research coupled with high potential, created a synergy that has left us awestruck. This is the true legacy of ALMA – not just an instrument but a platform for exploring the uncharted territories of our universe.
