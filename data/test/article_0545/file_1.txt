The percentage of scientific programs that have successfully published data from ALMA is considered an important indicator of the facility's effectiveness. This measure examines how effectively research teams can transform raw data into published scientific results (peer-reviewed publications or archival materials). The figure illustrates this progress over time, showing which programs received data during the specific period and are included in each bin.  The chart is not a perfectly cumulative representation for the leftmost bins due to limited numbers of studies in those early periods. However, based on the data, the ALMA publication rate for Cycle 0 was roughly 85%, which is unusually high even compared to other space-based research programs. Facilities like the Very Large Telescope (VLT), Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton) typically have publication rates ranging from 50% to 75%. The ALMA's high publication rate indicates its innovative capacity and signifies that the data provided by ALMA is exceptionally good. It also highlights how well the researchers have managed to use the data effectively.  This conclusion is further supported by research conducted on the ALMA User Survey. It's possible the selection of research projects within Cycle 0 prioritised programs with high scientific potential (projects expected to be successful) and a low level of risk. This could also explain the extremely high demand for time, or oversubscription rate of nine for the cycle.
