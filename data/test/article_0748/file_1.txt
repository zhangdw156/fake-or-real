First Release of Images from VISTA  
The new ESO survey telescope VISTA (the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy) has recently started operations at Paranal and has just released its initial public images. VISTA was developed by a group of 18 universities in the UK, led by Queen Mary, University of London, as part of an agreement after the UK joined ESO. The Science and Technology Facilities Council's UK Astronomy Technology Centre managed the telescope’s design and construction. ESO officially accepted VISTA during a ceremony at ESO Headquarters in Garching, Germany, with representatives from Queen Mary and STFC present on 10 December 2009. VISTA will now be operated by ESO. It features a 4.1-meter primary mirror and has a field of view of 1.65 degrees. Due to its primary mirror's speed (F/0.98)—the biggest mirror made at such a quick focal ratio—the figuring and polishing process was quite challenging. The secondary mirror is 1.24 meters in diameter. As a survey telescope, VISTA includes one instrument: a camera with 16 infrared detectors, each 2048 × 2048 pixels in size. The Raytheon VIRGO HgCdTe detectors have 0.34-arcsecond pixels, and a single image observed is an area of 0.6 square degrees. By combining six shifted images, it can cover a total area of 1.5 × 1.0 degrees. The camera was designed and built by a collaboration that includes the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, the UK ATC, and the University of Durham. It has five broadband filters (Z, Y, J, H, and Ks), plus a slot for additional user-provided filters. The front cover displays a color-composite image of NGC 2024, a hazy star-forming region in the Orion Cloud known as the Flame Nebula. The VISTA science verification programs include two mini-surveys: one focusing on star formation and faint stars in the Orion area, and the other on the stellar halo of NGC 253. The data from these surveys will be processed via the VISTA Data Flow System, jointly managed by the Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit and the Wide Field Astronomy Unit in Edinburgh, with reduced data released to the public. VISTA is set to conduct large surveys with a five-year plan including six public surveys. Observations will commence shortly, covering various projects such as surveying variable stars in the Milky Way, investigating the Magellanic Clouds, conducting a southern hemisphere survey, a large-scale galaxy survey, and two deep, small field surveys.
