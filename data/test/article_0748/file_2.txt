First Release of Images from VISTA  
The new ESO survey telescope VISTA (the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy) has recently started operations at Paranal and has just released its first public images. VISTA was developed by a group of 18 universities in the UK, led by Queen Mary, University of London, and was included as a contribution to ESO when the UK joined the organization. The telescope's design and construction were managed by the Science and Technology Facilities Council’s UK Astronomy Technology Centre. ESO formally accepted VISTA during a ceremony at its headquarters in Garching, Germany, on 10 December 2009, attended by representatives from Queen Mary, University of London, and STFC. VISTA will now be operated by ESO. It features a 4.1-meter primary mirror with a 1.65-degree field of view. Due to its fast primary (F/0.98)—the largest mirror made with such a low focal ratio—figuring and polishing the primary was a challenging task. The secondary mirror has a diameter of 1.24 meters. As a survey telescope, it has a single instrument, a camera made up of 16 infrared detectors, each with a resolution of 2048 × 2048 pixels. The Raytheon VIRGO HgCdTe detectors have pixels measuring 0.34 arcseconds, and a single “pawprint” image covers an area of 0.6 square degrees. By combining six offset images, VISTA can capture a complete field of 1.5 × 1.0 degrees. The camera was developed by a group including Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, the UK ATC, and the University of Durham, and includes five broadband filters: Z, Y, J, H, and Ks, with an option for additional user-provided filters. Featured in the front cover is a color-composite image of the dusty star-forming region NGC 2024 in the Orion Cloud, known as the Flame Nebula. The VISTA science verification program includes two mini-surveys: one focusing on star formation and very low mass stars and brown dwarfs in the Orion region, and another on the stellar halo in NGC 253. The resultant data will be processed by the VISTA Data Flow System, managed by the Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit and the Wide Field Astronomy Unit in Edinburgh, with reduced data publicly available. VISTA will focus on large surveys, with a five-year plan for six public surveys set to begin soon. These surveys will cover variable stars in the Milky Way, the Magellanic Clouds, a survey of the southern hemisphere, a large galaxy survey, and two deep small field surveys.
