To facilitate rapid feedback on VISTA Survey results into the Vista Data Flow System (VDFS), a two-day meeting was held in November 2009 at ESO involving the ESO SV team and CASU representatives. Currently, raw VISTA data reach CASU one week after being stored by the ESO archive; subsequently, all data are processed by CASU before transfer to the VISTA Science Archive (VSA) at the Wide Field Astronomy Unit (WFAU) in Edinburgh. It is crucial that the night logs facilitate scientific data processing. As such, reliable communication channels must be established between the ESO and VDFS components in the UK and vice versa. Specific areas for improvement were identified during this meeting. VIRCAM detectors display a slight deviation from linearity, typically around 1-10%, and saturate at roughly 24,000 to 37,000 ADU. To utilize these detectors in their linear capabilities, VISTA users are advised to implement short integration times, e.g., DIT less than 10 seconds, for H- and Ks-bands. The operations in Paranal implemented careful monitoring of flats during sunset due to potential issues outside the linearity regime. Astronomers at ESO and CASU discussed astrometric and photometric calibration thoroughly, with the former working well in the Orion fields but facing challenges in the case of NGC 253's bright disc. The latter is susceptible to inaccurate results when reference stars are impacted by false detections from crowded bright extended objects in their field. However, this issue was identified by SV data, enabling more robust quality checks on the 2MASS star catalogue. Consequently, the VISTA pipeline was updated to correctly implement astrometry. JHKs photometry and zero points are calculated using the same 2MASS photometry for comparison, which provides a basis for calibration. Z- and J-band calibrations rely on a linear relationship between the 2MASS Jâ€“H color and independent zero point calibration via standard fields taken during the night.
