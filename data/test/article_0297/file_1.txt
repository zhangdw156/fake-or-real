The relationship between stars' size (stellar Mass) and their rate of forming new stars (star Formation Rate) was already noticeable when considering stars around redshift 2 but becomes even clearer when analyzing specific Star Formation Rates (sSFR). The study found an average sSFR for galaxies detected using ALMA data consistent with what scientists call "main sequence" models developed for early stage galaxy formations based on previous research from Noeske et al., Daddi et al.. This suggests there's likely just one simple pattern for how much new stars form based on how massive they are within this range . Interestingly , without using those observations , scientists would have thought there was no clear pattern or trend for how much new stars form based on their size above certain limits . Additionally , they found evidence suggesting dust obscuring can significantly impact the amount observed compared to unobscured regions , showing an increase roughly tenfold between extremely massive stars(around three times ten9 solar masses) and larger ones(around three times ten10 solar mas). These findings indicate strong connection between Stellar Mass detectability using submillimeterMillimeter wavelengths where bigger scales lead towards less visibility due their size exceeding certain thresholds .
