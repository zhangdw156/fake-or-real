ESO currently uses a range of instruments that operate in optical, infrared, and millimeter wavelength ranges. While users are ultimately responsible for the quality of their data analysis, it is challenging for them to be entirely knowledgeable in all the observational techniques associated with ESO instruments, making it hard to utilize general-purpose tools like IRAF and ESOMIDAS effectively. Thus, specific software designed with precise algorithms is essential. ESO is focusing on creating and distributing data reduction recipes for all VLT/VLTI instruments based on the ESO Common Pipeline Library (CPL). Users can run these recipes offline through the Gasgano graphical tool or the EsoRex command line tool. The main role of these recipes is to function as automatic pipelines within the dataflow system and produce items suitable for quality control. The goal is to provide users with more flexibility in engaging with the data reduction process and analyzing both intermediate and final products to improve the quality of results. Additionally, reusing as much existing software as possible, including the current pipelines and legacy tools, is a priority. The objective is to integrate ESO recipes within a versatile environment without the high costs of developing an entirely new software system. This approach holds promise for significantly enhancing user experience while efficiently using available resources.
