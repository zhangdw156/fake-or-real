ESO is currently using a variety of instruments that operate in optical, infrared, and millimeter wavelength ranges. While users are responsible for the quality of their data analysis, it is challenging for them to be well-versed in all the different observation methods that ESO instruments use. Therefore, specialized software with precisely tuned algorithms is necessary. ESO is working on developing and providing data reduction procedures for all VLT/VLTI instruments. These procedures utilize the ESO Common Pipeline Library (CPL) and can be operated offline using the Gasgano graphical tool or the EsoRex command line tool. The main purposes of these procedures are to function as automatic workflows in the data system and to create products for quality control. The goal is to give users more flexibility to engage with the data reduction process and evaluate both intermediate and final data products to enhance the quality of results. Moreover, it is important to reuse as much existing software as possible, including current and older tools. The aim is to integrate ESO procedures into a flexible setup without having to build an entirely new and costly software system. This strategy is believed to significantly benefit users while making the best use of existing resources.
