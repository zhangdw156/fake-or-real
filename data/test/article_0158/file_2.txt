In April 2019, a survey conducted by astronomers within ESA (European Southern Observatory) focused on how well-known and useful its public surveys are to other scientists working in astronomy research fields using its archive database system(s). The findings revealed that over two-thirds (60) knew about these public surveys while nearly a quarter (25) have already utilized some archived information collected through them when supporting their own research projects.. Most scientists accessing public survey information retrieved it directly through ESA's archive system; those who did so reported publishing one to three peer-reviewed articles based on this information acquired via public surveys.. Overall user feedback regarding utility was overwhelmingly positive across various aspects such as ease-of-use and communication efficiency with ESA staff responsible for managing these resources . Users widely expressed satisfaction with both ESAs archival interfaces as well as its Phase III initiatives which facilitated access to this valuable resource library . Lastly ,the survey found that descriptions accompanying each new release proved very helpful in guiding researchers towards utilizing available datasets effectively .
