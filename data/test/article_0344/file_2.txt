Fronts on options two and three will be discussed as they share similarities according to PI input; together these represent roughly half our data set - eight percent using just option two while four point nine percent used just option three . There's a significant difference between programs classified as "SM" versus "VM", especially when it comes to response tied directly towards those choices - this may be due in part because "VM" programs are more susceptible to bad weather but not so much so for "SM". We saw some correlation between requests made about seeing conditions alongside quality control ratings within those programs designated as "SM". It was no surprise then that most such programs demanded relatively good seeing conditions ( one arcsecond) resulting in higher percentages being classified at high quality control grade levels—upwards from ten percent—than other program groups within our study.. Looking at telescope usage shows distinct patterns – approximately twenty six percent coming from VLTI telescopes while unit telescope one accounts for twenty percent – both numbers significantly skewed towards AMBER based programs often associated with guaranteed time observations which carry inherent risks given their use on novel instruments . Most UT1 program occurrences were linked back during early CRIRES operations or issues stemming from degraded coatings on FORS-IIs longitudinal atmospheric dispersion corrector—which has since been resolved . Further examination into response specifically mentioning choice three reveals its connection being either adverse weather events , technical issues(primarily impacting VM), or completion rates below fifty percent in SM programs – allowing us conclude most cases involving these two choices can likely be attributed toward ESOs operational model(andor reflect early adoption periods for complex systems.)
