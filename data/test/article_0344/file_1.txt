Options two and three are similar enough that we will discuss them together because they overlap significantly as confirmed by PI input data shows they account for about one-quarter percent each overall in this study's sample size . Option two accounts for eight point two percent while Option three accounts for four point nine percent combined . There's a big difference between programs using either "SM" or "VM" when it comes to how these particular options were used . This may be due in part because programs using "VM" often experience adverse effects from bad weather while programs using "SM" generally don't see this problem so much . There was also some correlation found between requests regarding seeing limits , quality control grade levels ,and program usage under both "SM" "VM". Most programs utilizing SM tended towards better seeing conditions (under one arc second )and higher quality control grade levels compared to other programs analyzed . Finally there appears be distinct patterns when looking at how many telescopes responded based on their usage - nearly half responding from either VLT interferometer or UT1 - which have unique characteristics during their respective operations period.. While some UT1 projects faced issues like degraded coatings on FORS instruments , those issues have since been resolved.. A deeper look into how many projects used just Option three reveals it was mostly impacted by bad weather , technical loss factors specific to VM, or simply very low completion rates under SM. Overall we believe most instances involving Options Two Three can be explained through ESOs operational model or reflect initial challenges faced during complex system development stages
