Following the successful completion of a demonstrator program in February 2012, a project was initiated to procure a fully functional LFC system (Lumped Fused Coriolis) for HARPS, an astronomical instrument used for measuring star movement.  This new system will be offered to the astronomy community after successfully integrating it with the telescope. This project aims to:
* **Improve HARPS:** Enhance its accuracy and reliability. 
* **Develop future instruments:** Provide a foundation for upcoming projects like ESPRESSO, which requires LFC expertise.
* **Bridge the gap between HARPS and ESPRESSO:**  Enable detection of potentially habitable exoplanets.
* **Advance scientific understanding:** Help identify lower-mass planets and understand stellar activity better. 

The HARPS instrument currently boasts a radial velocity precision (RV) of about 60 cm/s. Knowledge of the limitations has allowed us to pinpoint causes hindering RV accuracy, including light injection, wavelength calibration system fluctuations, and detector temperature variability.  After implementing a new injection system in 2009, which improved image stability, the Th-Ar wavelength calibration system is currently the main factor restricting long-term HARPS RV precision.
The LFC, with its demonstrated capability for achieving stability comparable to HARPS at about 3 cm/s, offers the potential for reaching a long-term RV precision below 30 cm/s, enabling detection of Earth-mass planets in close orbits. This level of precision sits between current HARPS performance and the 10 cm/s accuracy expected from ESPRESSO on the VLT (Very Large Telescope) within approximately four years.
The LFC calibration system is a key element of ESPRESSO, expected to play a vital role in instrument operation and software development.  Transitioning from laboratory prototype to an operational device on HARPS will trigger the production phase and drive development of an operational comb for subsequent high-precision radial velocity instruments for both the VLT and the E-ELT (Extremely Large Telescope).
The experience gathered through this HARPS LFC project will be immensely valuable in further development of ESPRESSO and beyond. While achieving exceptional RV data with HARPS, this program will provide insights into long-term systematics (if any), optimize comb operations, and the reduction software before ESPRESSO's launch and well before the preliminary design phase of any high-resolution spectrograph for the E-ELT.
