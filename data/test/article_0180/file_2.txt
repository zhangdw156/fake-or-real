This section outlines how five new large-scale astronomy projects were chosen for observation using data from both existing telescopes like those at Mauna Kea as well as newer ones like those being put up around China's shores - all part off what is known as "the second round" or "the second cycle" â€“ of data collection put forth by researchers working under a program called "The Virtual Telescope Project". These efforts were initiated back when they first announced they would be building out this massive network back at least a decade ago when they first received funding from NASA's Chinese counterpart organization known as CNES'. The decision making behind picking these specific research groups took place between late springearly summer last year after careful consideration involving multiple stages including reviews conducted both internally within different departments involved as well as an official approval given out through various levels before finally being made public online via publications on websites run by organizations like that run by our own University here at Berkeley China Center For Advanced Scientific Computing . These five groups then got underway collecting data shortly after that Chinese New Year celebration last month!
Here are some additional details about each group:
Timely Observations: Most focus on studying objects that change or change frequently such as stars or other celestial bodies; some also aim to study recently discovered phenomena such as supernovae or black holes once they arise amongst other things...and one even focuses specifically on discovering faint objects deep within space based upon pre-existing knowledge about where those types can be found!
Tracking Progress: These efforts will continue for several years beyond just one single set amount because there is no end date set yet so far...but if you want updates you can check out what's going down now through direct communication channels maintained between them related organizations
