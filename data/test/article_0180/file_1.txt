This section describes how Cycle 2 VISTA surveys were chosen after initial proposals from astronomers within astronomy community submitted back in October of 2015 . It details key steps including:
Initial interest: The selection process began when astronomers submitted proposals for Cycle II studies during October - November , of the year .
Review Panel: A panel reviewed these proposals before recommending specific projects for further consideration by other experts at meetings held throughout early - mid -year . These recommendations went through multiple rounds before being finalized by senior scientists at ESO who approved funding for those selected projects..
Finally it summarizes key information about all seven selected studies:
Observational Focus: Most focus on capturing time-domain data (events happening over long periods). This includes measuring changes across time or detecting variations within objects as they evolve over years or decades.. Some also utilize target observation modes that allow quick follow-up after astronomical events are detected..
