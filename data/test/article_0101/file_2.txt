This workflow involves three feedback loops:
1.Quality Control: Immediately after observing (OB) completion, Quality Control checks if it was technically successful and provides data even if atmospheric conditions weren't ideal for all targets within an observation block (OB). Targets lacking enough signal-to-noise ratio can receive optimized exposures later during follow-up observations for those same fields..
2.Data Management: The Data Management system assesses each target's progress against specific spectral criteria within its Level 1 pipeline processing stage and communicates this information back to operations for scheduling future observations efficiently..
3.Operations Monitoring: A shared database allows both surveys and ESO (European Southern Observatory) to track overall observatory performance at least every two weeks using metrics like "figure of merit" or "successfully observed targets." If surveys fall behind schedule, adjustments might need approval from both science coordination board and ESO before proceeding further..
