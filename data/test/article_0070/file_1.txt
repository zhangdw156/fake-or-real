The release version 1 (p1) of our Period 105 Call For Proposals user interface marks an important step forward after receiving positive feedback so far . After successfully implementing this new interface we'll shift focus towards streamlining Proposal Traffic Management through an improved online platform called "OPC management". The goal here is creating a unified platform where reviewers can easily manage every aspect related to evaluating proposals - including conflict declarations , assignment updates , grading , reviews comments - making it easier for both reviewers OPO staff members alike .
This upgrade simplifies complex processes by consolidating multiple tools into one single view instead relying on various isolated systems or manual intervention . Additionally were updating our User Portal with enhanced features such as incorporating scientifictechnical keywords specific to each astronomer registered within it allowing us experiment with advanced algorithms like expertise matching when assigning proposals .
Finally were adopting GRID institution classification standards as opposed previous departmental structures within affiliations which improves accuracy consistency across submissions . For transparency purposes we'll now require users who submit proposals or participate as reviewers provide their gender information during registration â€“ again aimed at mitigating potential biases throughout reviews..
