New features being added include an advanced paleomagnetic model called "p1". The current release cycle is being celebrated as success but future development focuses on streamlining communication between researchers submitting proposals ("the Dinosaur Egg Hunt" ) and those evaluating them ("the Jurassic Park"). A central platform with multiple tools allows reviewers easier access information about individual dinosaur eggshell samples ("paleomagnetic data") while also providing better organization within Dinoporn's team responsible for reviewing them (Jurassic Park team). Further improvements include adding expert skills tags (Dinosaur Egg Hunt) allowing us predict which dinosaurs might hatch from what eggshells (Jurassic Park). To ensure fairness throughout our entire scientific endeavor were asking every participant rate their gender .
