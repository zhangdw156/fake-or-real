Scientists believe stars typically form in clusters that share similar chemical compositions. However these clusters are affected by large scale galactic movements like spiral arms or mergers but not their chemical makeup . By combining observations about how fast these clusters move with their chemical composition across different parts of our galaxy , scientists can better understand how our galaxy has evolved over time . The new telescope called "FOURMOST" allows us to see all parts at once which is very powerful and could help scientists understand what makes up each part of our galaxy including its thick discs , thin discs , bulges , haloes etc . It could even reveal details about interactions between different regions within our galaxy such as where gas flows into or out from it .
