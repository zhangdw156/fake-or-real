ESO at the XXVIIth IAU General Assembly  
The International Astronomical Union (IAU) holds its General Assembly every three years, making it one of the largest astronomy conferences globally. This year's XXVIIth General Assembly took place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from August 3 to 14, attracting 2109 registered attendees from around the world. This is the first time the IAU General Assembly has been hosted in Brazil. Over the past decade, astronomy in Brazil has significantly developed, thanks to considerable investments from the government. The astronomy community has expanded to nearly 200 astronomers, who were responsible for almost 2% of the world's astronomical research papers in 2008, which is notable for a developing country. More than 50 ESO staff participated in various aspects of the two-week event. Participants engaged in six Symposia, sixteen Joint Discussions, and ten Special Sessions, featuring a mix of review talks and innovative presentations. ESO also showcased a notable exhibition stand, and staff contributed to the IAU Press Office and the International Year of Astronomy 2009 initiative. The Press Office welcomed over 80 press members, primarily from Brazil, and arranged more than 50 interviews. ESO decided to host social events during some afternoons at their stand, which became popular, possibly due to the exhibit of large ESO images and the availability of delicious Brazilian food and drinks. Five Resolutions were passed during the General Assembly's Closing Ceremony, including a ten-year plan for advancing astronomy globally titled “The Strategic Plan: Astronomy for the Developing World,” viewed as a follow-up to the International Year of Astronomy 2009. The local authorities and media positively embraced the IAU General Assembly, leading to substantial press coverage, with several articles and television segments prominently featuring ESO’s telescopes.
