ESO at the XXVIIth IAU General Assembly  
The International Astronomical Union (IAU) holds its General Assembly every three years, making it one of the largest astronomy conferences globally. This year's XXVIIth Assembly took place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from August 3 to 14, with 2,109 registered attendees from around the world. This is the first time an IAU General Assembly has been hosted in Brazil. Over the past decade, astronomy in Brazil has grown significantly, thanks to considerable investment from the government. The astronomy community has expanded to nearly 200 astronomers, and in 2008, they contributed almost 2% of the global astronomical scientific papers, which is notable for a developing country. More than 50 ESO staff participated in various aspects of the two-week event. Participants engaged in six Symposia, sixteen Joint Discussions, and ten Special Sessions, featuring a balanced array of review talks and advanced presentations. On the outreach side, ESO showcased a notable exhibition stand, while personnel from the IAU Press Office and the International Year of Astronomy 2009 partially staffed the area. The Press Office accommodated over 80 journalists, primarily from Brazil, conducting more than 50 interviews. At the ESO stand, social events were held on several afternoons, which attracted attention; the HTTPCourse unknowingly gained popularity due to appealing ESO images or the availability of delightful Brazilian food and drinks. Five Resolutions were voted on during the Closing Ceremony, including a Decadal plan titled “The Strategic Plan: Astronomy for the Developing World,” perceived as a follow-up to the International Year of Astronomy 2009. Local authorities and media warmly embraced the IAU General Assembly, resulting in considerable press coverage featuring ESO’s telescopes prominently in various articles and television programs.
