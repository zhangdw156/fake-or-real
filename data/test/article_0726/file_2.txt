Dr. Leonardo Testi has been appointed as the new European Project Scientist for ALMA, starting in May 2007. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Florence in 1997 and then worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory at Caltech. In 1998, he joined the Arcetri Astrophysical Observatory, later becoming part of INAF, where he was also a member of the Science Council. He has chaired the European ALMA Science Advisory committee and served on the ALMA Science Advisory committee, giving him strong expertise in the project and its scientific potential. Leonardo focuses on studying circumstellar discs around newly formed stars, which are thought to evolve into planetary systems. This research complements the optical searches for exoplanets conducted with instruments like HARPS and the ESO 3.6-m telescope. Current studies of circumstellar discs face limitations in sensitivity and angular resolution. ALMA will significantly improve sensitivity by over 40 times and angular resolution by more than 5 times compared to existing instruments. This advancement will facilitate major breakthroughs in fields such as star formation, galaxy evolution and dynamics, Solar System research, and cosmology.
