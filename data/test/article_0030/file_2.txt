The project uses data from existing surveys like BOSS to determine how sensitive their instruments need to be in order to correctly identify galaxies at specific wavelengths based on redshift measurements using faint xrays sources detected by instruments like XMM Newton . They then estimate how much signal is needed per pixel location across three colors - blue , green , red - based on their prior work with these tools . They expect this standard set up would need very high signal strength to achieve their goals because they plan on using it in conjunction with other telescopes like eROSITA . These estimations should hold true because these galaxies have many narrow emission or absorption lines that can help them accurately measure redshifts . For this survey they aim at observing all point source detections from eROSITA within two hours or less exposure time and use similar selection methods as WISE surveys targeting both groups . Finally , its goal is reaching high levels(90) coverage across areas spanning thousands upon thousands square degrees but also focusing deeply into smaller regions covering hundreds square degrees depending on what part you want your sample size in each area
