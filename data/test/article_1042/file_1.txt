As of now, ESO Reflex is being tested in beta and is expected to launch to everyone in the fourth quarter of 2008 with relevant workflows and tools. Those wanting early access to ESO Reflex, particularly for developed workflows like FORS spectroscopy and AMBER, can contact reflex@eso.org. Efforts are ongoing to improve the data processing methods. The current algorithms mainly focus on calibrating and extracting parameters needed to check the instruments' health status. While some results are good enough for immediate scientific use, this is not typically the case yet. Therefore, data processing methods will be available in modular format allowing for interaction with the documented processes at significant points, ensuring collaboration with ESO Reflex. The algorithms are also continuously improving to ultimately enable the generation of high-quality scientific products directly on the usersâ€™ desktop.
