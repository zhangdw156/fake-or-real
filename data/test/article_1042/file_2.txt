As of now, ESO Reflex is in beta and is set to be released to the public in the fourth quarter of 2008, along with the necessary workflows and tools. Individuals who want early access to ESO Reflex, especially for FORS spectroscopy and AMBER workflows, should reach out to reflex@eso.org. There is ongoing work to improve the data reduction processes. The current algorithms focus on processing calibrations and gathering necessary parameters to monitor the instruments' health. While some products produced are of sufficient quality for immediate scientific use, this is not generally true. Therefore, the data reduction processes are being made modular to allow users to interact with intermediate products at important scientific stages and to integrate smoothly with ESO Reflex. The data reduction algorithms are continually being improved with the goal of enabling the creation of high-quality science products on users' desktops.
