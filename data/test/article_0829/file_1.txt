We needed to be more careful in choosing and maintaining machines and their parts because our system uses magnetic disks as consumables. Specifically, since the disks are used to transfer data, it is necessary for the machines in the mountains and those in Garching to have compatible disk slots and trays. Removing and installing disks is a frequent task, so the mechanics must work smoothly and reliably, and the parts need to be strong enough for numerous assembly and disassembly cycles. Additionally, the trays should be compact, efficient in cooling, and cost-effective. The disks arrive in their trays and are then installed in a different machine, so the slots must be fully compatible. To ensure better oversight on these details, we opted for a computer selection process that specifies individual computer parts instead of a complete model. All parts are standard and readily available from numerous suppliers. The new ESO data center accommodates a 24-machine NGAS cluster. With a planned upgrade of this cluster to high-capacity disks and a different RAID setup, these 24 machines can hold up to 0.5 Petabyte of data.
