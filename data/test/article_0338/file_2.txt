astronauts use special instruments called " hoppas" that help them see faint objects like planets or planets orbiting other stars by blocking out all but what they want us to see . For example , a " kaha" on Earth would be like an invisible screen that blocks out everything except for Earth's surface . This helps us get clear pictures because it eliminates all unwanted light coming from around our target object . To get even better images , there are also things called " launch pads" that help focus on specific parts without too much background noise .
Let me know if you have any questions about this!
