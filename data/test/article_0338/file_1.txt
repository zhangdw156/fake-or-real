A specialized device called "coronagraph" helps astronomers observe stars clearly even when they are close together by blocking out their scattered light (known as "diffraction"). This allows astronomers to see faint details around stars without being obscured by their bright centers and their surrounding areas' patterns caused by starlight scattering through telescopes' openings or imperfections within them.. To achieve this clarity even further SPHERE uses several tools: A Lyot stop blocks out specific wavelengths from entering into an optical path for better clarity; A Pupil Apodiser smooths out rough edges on mirrors that cause unwanted ripples; And finally A Mask blocks off specific areas within its path for better focus on desired targets . These tools allow SPHERE observations reach extremely high levels for observing faint details around stars with remarkable accuracy .
