The Very Large Telescope (VLT) was designed as a powerful observatory using four large telescopes that can be used individually or combined to achieve incredibly sharp images across vast areas called optical interferometry (VLTI). Many scientists collaborate on building these telescopes using their own expertise while receiving guaranteed observation time at ESO's facilities funded through their contributions to projects like this one
Currently equipped with twelve main tools plus three specialized tools for special experiments at Paranal Observatory's site , it offers wide field imaging capabilities thanks to two additional cameras called VISTA VST .
This combined system enables astronomers to study various aspects like planet detection around other stars , galaxies structure , star birth processes , ancient star characteristics etc.. This makes it one unique observatory globally capable enough to answer many important questions about our universe . To maintain its leading position researchers have planned regular upgrades over several years that will continue pushing research frontiers .
