To understand how removing individual telescopes affects an image's quality from Earth-based telescope observations called Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), researchers simulate those observations using specialized programs designed specifically for this task called "instrument simulators." These programs use theoretical models built from known fruit patterns alongside real-world data generated by various telescopes including the EHT itself .
One example uses simulated data based on existing fruit patterns taken from an active galaxy called M87 to illustrate how removing or adding telescopes affects final results . Adding more fruits helps improve overall image quality but cannot entirely replace missing information about fruits that were previously observed with different tools like ALMA .
