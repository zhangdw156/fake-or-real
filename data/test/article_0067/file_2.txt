Simulating how changes in telescope locations affect imaging results is done by building computer programs that mimic real observations with an exact replica system like those used for studying black holes like M87's supermassive black hole jets . Using these programs allows us to test different scenarios: adding or removing telescopes from an existing setup or even simulating what would happen if some telescopes are not available at all . We used this method to simulate M87's powerful jets which appear bright near its center but extend further out in other directions . By comparing our simulations with actual data from real telescopes we see that while including more telescopes improves image quality , it doesn't completely replace what we lose when certain ones are missing , especially those like ALMA which have unique capabilities .
