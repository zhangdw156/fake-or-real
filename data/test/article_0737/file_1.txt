Having one adaptive mirror in the telescope's optical system offers significant benefits. The entire telescope functions as an adaptive optical system, allowing for quick wavefront adjustments without needing extra optics or mechanics. With both the Nasmyth and Cassegrain focuses, this advantage triples. The system enhances the performance of scientific instruments, reduces heat emissions for thermal IR instruments, broadens the field of view for all instruments, and decreases complexity at the focal planes. In contrast, using a 'post-focal' adaptive optics (AO) system would require five to six additional warm mirrors at the image focal plane. Table 1 presents a comparison that supports the decision to use a deformable secondary mirror (DSM), although there are other factors that influenced this choice. During the development of the AO Facility design, it became evident that combining several complex systems raised significant issues, particularly regarding assembly, integration, testing (AIT), commissioning, and control strategy. These issues, common to telescope designs with multiple deformable mirrors (such as Extremely Large Telescopes or ELTs), would greatly benefit from practical experience gained from a Very Large Telescope (VLT) “prototype.” Thus, the AO Facility serves as an important model for designing any ELT. This rationale significantly motivated ESO management to advance the AOF concept with a DSM. The following list highlights shared challenges between the AO Facility and an ELT: Develop a high-order adaptive telescope capable of operating at the diffraction limit – Ensure and enhance the current large deformable mirror with 10 mm spacing (similar to M6 for OWL) – Ensure the manufacturing and handling of large, thin shells – Develop and monitor reliable laser and CCD technologies – Provide substantial computing power for AOF at ~1 kHz (200 times faster than NAOS) – Develop, operate, and master laser tomography AO and ground layer AO systems – Create and manage a detailed error budget to achieve the required Strehl ratios – Master strategies for measuring interaction matrices (both in the lab and in the sky) – Manage multiple interleaved control loops and offloading processes – Establish comprehensive testing procedures for DSMs in the lab – Oversee efficient commissioning of such a complex facility.
