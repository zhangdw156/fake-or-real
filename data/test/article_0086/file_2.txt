This study examined astronomical research articles published between January 2010 and July 2017 within ESO Telescope Bibliography (TELBIB). The study analyzed trends regarding submissions: while initially most TELBIB publications went directly through TELBIB itself (88 by early by early), by late the majority went through other platforms like Arxiv (reaching nearly full adoption around middling point).
The researchers looked at both total citations across all publications types (including those available solely on Arxiv) as well as individual publication impacts based on how many times they're referenced compared against other astronomy journal articles ("AJ" - Astrophysical Journal) . They found significant variation amongst these "non-"arxiv publications - including diverse author affiliations from different observatories even being published elsewhere beyond just "AJ".
While there wasn't immediately apparent reason explaining why certain research didn't go onto Arxiv initially , they did find out why via surveys sent out specifically targeting authors who didnt submit their work via Arxiv; This revealed several common reasons such as time constraints or prioritization issues even differing opinions about its importance within scientific publishing processes .
