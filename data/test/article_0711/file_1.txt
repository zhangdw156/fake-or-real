GHostS includes the host galaxies of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) for which photometric and spectroscopic information exists in published literature. A total of 39 galaxies have been collected from 81 different studies out of 108 known redshift GRBs. One of the spectra in the GHostS database pertains to the galaxy hosting GRB 990712 at a redshift of z = 0.433, observed using the Very Large Telescope. This galaxy shows very strong emission lines from regions where star formation is highly active. Its stellar mass is estimated to be a few times 10 raised to the power of 9 solar masses, akin to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud, but it has a star formation rate that is ten times higher, around 6 solar masses per year. This results in a specific star formation rate that is 100 times that of the Milky Way. Similar GRB-hosting galaxies have been found at distances corresponding to a universe that was less than 1 billion years old, yet they are challenging to identify with standard methods. Most current surveys that examine the high-redshift universe are able only to identify galaxies similar to or larger than the Milky Way. Compiling the results published by the GRB research community is generally difficult because many papers can be published about any single event. An example is GRB 060218, which happened in February 2006 at a redshift of z = 0.0335 and was linked to a supernova detected three days post-alert. Over a year and a half, more than 20 articles dedicated to this event were published or were about to be published in peer-reviewed journals, including four in *Nature*. This abundance of material serves as a primary motivation for the GHostS database, which seeks to gather, standardize, and make observational results readily available for the broader scientific community. The database is consistently expanding in both the number of host galaxies and the tools provided. Our goal is to eventually include all host galaxies identified during the operational years of the Swift satellite, meaning it could eventually hold a final count of several hundred galaxies.
