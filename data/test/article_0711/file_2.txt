GHostS includes the host galaxies of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) for which photometric and spectroscopic information exists in published literature. A total of 39 galaxies have been compiled from 81 different studies out of 108 known redshift GRBs. One example in the GHostS database is the galaxy hosting GRB 990712, observed at a redshift of z = 0.433 using the Very Large Telescope. This galaxy displays very strong emission lines from areas with high star formation activity. We calculated its stellar mass to be a few billion solar masses, similar to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud, but it forms stars at a tenfold higher rate, approximately 6 solar masses each year. This results in a specific star formation rate that is 100 times greater than that of the Milky Way. Similar galaxies that host GRBs can be found at distances corresponding to when the Universe was less than 1 billion years old, but they are challenging to detect using standard methods. Most current surveys of the high-redshift Universe can identify galaxies that are similar to or larger than the Milky Way based on stellar mass. Collecting published results from the GRB research community is often difficult due to the large volume of papers for each event. For instance, GRB 060218, a supernova-associated event that occurred in February 2006 at redshift z = 0.0335, led to over 20 published or soon-to-be-published articles in refereed journals, including four in Nature, within about 18 months. This abundance of material is a primary reason for the creation of GHostS. The database collects, standardizes, and makes observational results readily available to the community. It is continuously expanding in the number of objects included and the tools provided. Our aim is to eventually incorporate all host galaxies identified during the operation of Swift, which could result in a final dataset of several hundred galaxies.
