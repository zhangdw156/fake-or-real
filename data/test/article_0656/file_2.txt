Pluto and Triton both have thin atmospheres that form when volatile ices on their surfaces melt. The composition of these atmospheres is largely determined by the surface's makeup and how easily different types of ice melt.  Despite being far from the sun, these atmospheres are strongly affected by solar heat. However, their thickness changes throughout time due to Pluto's rotation axis tilt and Triton's elliptical orbit.  Pluto's atmosphere is expected to collapse at its furthest point from the sun in 2113.  Triton's atmosphere was discovered during the Voyager 2 mission.  It primarily consists of nitrogen (N2), which was detected by ultraviolet spectroscopy, with a ground pressure of 14 µbar. However, methane gas could also be observed.  Pluto's N2 must be dominant in its atmosphere but cannot be directly observed from Earth. Its atmospheric methane detection came only through a signal-to-noise ratio experiment by NASA’s Infrared Telescope. In contrast to Pluto's surface observations, many measurements of Pluto's upper atmosphere have been made using stellar occultations.  While these measurements provide valuable insight into the upper atmosphere’s thermal structure (around 100 K versus ~60K for Triton), they lack details about its lower layers and the connection between the upper layer and the surface.  Interestingly, repeated occultation observations revealed that Pluto's atmosphere expanded, roughly doubling its pressure between 1988 and 2002 despite receding from the sun. Similarly, Triton’s surface pressure increased during the 1990s.   A recent CRIRES observation at the VLT has yielded notable progress in this area.
