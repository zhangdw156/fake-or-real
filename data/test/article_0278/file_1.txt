Understanding how galaxies gather their fuel – gases like hydrogen – is crucial for understanding their growth over time ("galaxy formation"). The standard model suggests that hot gases within dark matter halos cool down within galaxies where they then replenish a supply needed for star birth ("cooling"). However any disruption to this flow significantly impacts how galaxies evolve ("fundamental consequences"). Therefore scientists need direct evidence about these processes: "it's important to directly observe" them happening."
Powerful telescopes like MUSE help us see these processes by studying ionized gases created by various events like star formations ("star-formation"), active galactic nuclei activity ("AGN"), or collisions with other objects (shocks). This allows astronomers to learn about past events like when stars formed within those galaxies (stellar kinematics) .
One process known as "ram pressure stripping", removes interstellar material but leaves behind mostly its stellar components because it affects only neutral materials near space debris rather than individual stars themselves.. This effect occurs when a nearby group of massive objects exert force upon surrounding galaxies while moving through dense space between them.Ram pressure stripping works best when there are many large objects around each other (galaxy clusters), although it has been observed even between smaller groups too (galaxy groups pairs).
