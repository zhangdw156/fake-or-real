Title: Status Update on Precision Photometry with FORS  

The two FOcal Reducer and low-dispersion Spectrographs (FORS) are the main imaging tools for the VLT. Since they are not designed for direct imaging, the precision of photometry that can be regularly achieved is constrained by strong skybackground and other factors. This article summarizes progress in a long-term effort to enhance the photometric calibration of the FORS instruments. The calibration strategy involves taking observations of photometric standards on every clear night, primarily to assess the performance of the instruments. The same data also help calibrate scientific observations when photometric accuracy is crucial. Two years ago, we initiated the FORS Absolute Photometry (FAP) project to evaluate the photometric performance of the FORS instruments and explore ways to improve their routine calibration for better photometric zero points (ZPs). Another aim of this project is to create procedures that enable users to achieve more precise photometric calibration. The findings are documented in two internal ESO reports. This article provides a brief overview of the challenges related to photometry with the FORS instruments and the current progress of the FAP project. Our efforts have primarily focused on the FORS1 camera, but most results will also apply to FORS2.
