Title: Status Update on Precision Photometry with FORS  

The two FOcal Reducer and low-dispersion Spectrographs (FORS) are the main imaging tools used at the VLT. Since they do not capture direct images, their photometry accuracy is affected by high sky background and other factors. This article provides an update on an ongoing project aimed at enhancing the photometric calibration of the FORS instruments. The calibration strategy involves taking measurements of photometric standards every clear night, mainly to assess the instruments' performance. The same measurements are also used to calibrate scientific data for programs that require accurate photometry. Two years ago, the FORS Absolute Photometry (FAP) project was initiated to evaluate the photometric capabilities of the FORS instruments and examine ways to refine their routine calibration for better photometric zero points (ZPs). Another objective is to establish methods that enable users to obtain more precise photometric calibration. The findings are documented in two internal ESO reports. This article summarizes the concerns related to photometry with FORS instruments and presents the current status of the FAP project. So far, our investigation has focused on the FORS1 camera, but most conclusions also apply to FORS2.
