The Atacama Large Millimetersubmillimeter Array (ALMA) project is a collaboration between European Southern Observatory (ESO), East Asia North America partners along with Chile's government support . Over time, ESO's role in managing data access for ALMA has expanded beyond its usual user base due to increased interest in this powerful telescope system . To facilitate this integration , ESO streamlined its processes for acquiring and analyzing ALMA data into its broader operational framework while ensuring continued engagement with various user communities including those specializing in millimetersubmillimeter wavelengths . This transition was supported by University Committees (UCs) which ensure representation across diverse expertise within these scientific groups . UC members possess specialized skills relevant specifically for managing high-quality astronomical observations through their involvement in key areas such as technical support , proposal reviews ,data product quality control ,and feedback mechanisms related to observing initiatives .
