underground surveys conducted using NASA's Atacama Large Millimetersubmm Array (ALMA) aim at detecting faint distant star forming galaxies (DSFGS). These surveys involve carefully observing highly luminous objects called "calibrators" multiple times across various wavelengths within separate observation blocks ("OB"). By combining these measurements from multiple observers over time on many dates across various wavelengths ("bands"), scientists can achieve higher sensitivity levels capable of detecting fainter distant star forming galaxies than ever before - surpassing capabilities offered by previous missions like Herschel Space Telescope or ground based instruments alone . This combined approach enables detailed analysis due to extremely high spatial resolution achieved through simultaneous observation of both distant galaxy candidates (DFSG) along with prominent calibrator targets within an individual observation block ('OB').
Additionally , this technique allows researchers to employ self-calibration procedures enabling near perfect imaging despite long baselines employed by these large arrays as well as higher frequencies used during observation . Finally , utilizing multi wavelength datasets ensures reliable identification through confident confirmation against background noise while also allowing researchers to determine redshift values through analysis on submm spectral lines present within these same datasets .
Beyond simply detecting faint distant objects , this method offers opportunities including searching underground emitting line based targets (emission line) within almacals dataset alongside investigations into physical processes governing emissions associated with powerful jets emanating from active galactic nuclei (quasars) as well as searching common interstellar species present within light emitted by distant objects residing along specific lines between them .
