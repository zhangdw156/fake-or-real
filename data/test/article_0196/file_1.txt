This research uses calibration observations from NASA's Atacama Large Millimetersubmillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope called "ALMACAL" to conduct an extensive survey across various wavelengths looking specifically at dusty star forming galaxies (DSFGs) at high redshift – distant objects where stars form among clouds made up mostly dust particles).
The technique involves observing numerous bright objects known as "calibrators" on multiple dates across various wavelengths within an array called "observing blocks" (OB). These combined measurements help improve sensitivity allowing scientists new ways looking deeply into space – even fainter than previously possible using other telescopes like ESA's Herschel spacecraft – opening up opportunities studying dust emissions around ordinary star forming regions without needing expensive specialized equipment like ground based telescopes .
By carefully analyzing these combined measurements scientists can achieve near perfect image quality due to self -calibration techniques , enabling detailed analysis even when these distant objects happen coincidentally within these calibrated regions . This approach helps confirm faint detections by checking them against multiple frequency bands ensuring accuracy while also providing information about their redshift via detecting specific spectral lines associated with these powerful jets emanating from supermassive black holes found towards some celestial bodies .
In addition , this research aims not only detect but also understand how stars form within large clouds but also investigate how powerful jets emanate from certain types supermassive black holes found nearby some celestial bodies through detailed studies on their light emissions . Furthermore , it explores common interstellar materials present along specific pathways toward brilliant quasars helping researchers build better models about our universe .
