The survey results are still being analyzed.  Researchers are using complex techniques (like genetic algorithms and grid-searching) to determine detailed physical characteristics of Wâ€“R and OB-type stars from the VFTS database, including their temperature, gravity, mass loss rate, rotational velocity, chemical composition, etc. This will allow for a comprehensive study of wind parameters across all O and WN-type stars and offer the first look at how rotation affects surface abundances in massive stars.  Understanding if a star is binary will enhance our interpretation of these findings and allow testing of evolutionary models that incorporate both single-star and binary processes. These physical parameters will be combined to examine radiative and mechanical feedback beyond 30 Doradus, with the hope of testing spectral synthesis techniques used for analyzing distant, unresolved clusters/massive H ii regions.  A new Hubble Space Telescope program will provide detailed properties of massive stars in R136's central parsec region that can only be observed from space or with adaptive optics. Interestingly, longer wavelength observations suggest 30 Doradus is at the northern edge of a large cloud of molecular gas that extends for over 2000 pc southward. This ample supply of potential star-forming material indicates R136 will likely become an even more complex region in the coming millions of years.
