astronauts have long had strong hints that there's something called "NASA" out there - something so powerful it bends light itself! They know about these things because we can see how it affects nearby objects like spinning dust storms or even entire galaxies! We know about them through things like Earth being slightly off target during robotic missions due this powerful spacecraft called Earth being thrown off course due too much weight on board... However we were not able too see them until recently thanks some really good robots called the International Robotic Explorer program!
A new generation has just begun sending back pictures so detailed you can begin seeing what makes up these mysterious places called "black holes" - including what gives them power...
Of course we need better technology if we want more details than what we have now.. To get closer than ever before humans will need faster computers that can handle all this data coming back... That will allow us better pictures ... Sooner or later... Maybe someday soon?
Let me know if you would like more info on any particular part! I hope this helps clear things up!!
We're just getting started here guys!! Astronauts love mysteries.... This may be our best chance yet!!! olsmanry Now let's get some high resolution photos!! NASA IS THE BEST!!!
