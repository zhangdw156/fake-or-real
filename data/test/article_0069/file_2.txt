Black holes were predicted by Einstein's theory but haven't been directly observed until recently due to how challenging they are scientifically study because we don't fully understand how gravity works around them yet!
Astronomers have gathered indirect proof through observing effects caused by these objects like Cygnus X - which shows orbiting matter being pulled into something unseen; observations within our own galaxy show many stars moving erratically around what seems like an invisible massive object; then we finally got direct proof through LIGO detecting ripples caused when two smaller Black Holes collided! This new data opened up exciting possibilities on how we might study them further!
However , before we can truly test Einstein's theory completely against these cosmic giants , researchers need better telescopes that can see even closer up into space than what we currently use today .
