The ESO Distant Cluster Survey is a multichannel study of galaxies in 20 areas where galaxy clusters exist, at redshifts between 0.4 and 1, based on an ESO Large Programme from the 66th observing period. Candidate clusters were selected from the brightest objects found in the Las Campanas Distant Cluster Survey. They were confirmed by identifying a red sequence in moderately deep two-color data acquired by the FORS2 instrument on the VLT. For the 20 surveyed areas, the EDisCS collected detailed optical data in three bands with FORS2, near-infrared data in one or two bands with the SOFI on the NTT, in-depth multi-slit spectroscopy with FORS2, and extensive three-band imaging with the MPG/ESO 2.2-meter telescope along with the Wide Field Imager, as well as mosaic imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys for ten clusters with the highest redshifts. Additional follow-up programs included XMM-Newton X-ray observations, imaging with Spitzer's IRAC and MIPS, and narrow-band imaging of Ha. Photometric redshifts were produced by combining optical and near-infrared images using two different codes. The EDisCS dataset has enabled the study of galaxies in diverse environments with consistent data. It includes 16 clusters with a velocity dispersion over 400 km/s, ten groups with at least eight spectroscopically confirmed members, which had velocity dispersions between 150 and 400 km/s measured. It also includes comparison groups of lesser clusters (that is, galaxy associations with three to six galaxies) and "field" galaxies that do not belong to any cluster, group, or small group. One of the dataset's key attributes is the broad range of velocity dispersions — and therefore, masses — represented in the cluster sample. The cluster mass estimates obtained through VLT spectroscopy have been validated by weak lensing and X-ray measurements. As the first distant cluster collection suitable for evaluating how galaxy properties evolve with host mass, EDisCS offers examples of high-redshift clusters eventually evolving into a diverse array of cluster masses today.
