The ESO Distant Cluster Survey is a study of galaxies in 20 areas with galaxy clusters at redshifts between 0.4 and 1, based on a project approved by ESO in Period 66. Candidate clusters were selected from the brightest objects found in the Las Campanas Distant Cluster Survey and were confirmed by detecting the red sequence in moderately deep two-color data from FORS2 on the VLT. For all 20 areas, EDisCS compiled deep three-band optical images with FORS2, near-infrared images in one or two bands with SOFI on the NTT, deep multi-slit spectroscopy with FORS2, wide-field three-band imaging with the MPG/ESO 2.2-meter telescope and Wide Field Imager (WFI), and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) mosaic imaging for ten of the highest redshift clusters. Additional follow-up programs included XMM-Newton X-ray observations, Spitzer IRAC and MIPS imaging, and Ha narrow-band imaging. Photometric redshifts were calculated by combining optical and near-infrared images using two separate codes. The EDisCS dataset has enabled the study of galaxies in various environments with consistent data. In the EDisCS fields, there are 16 clusters with velocity dispersions over 400 km/s, ten groups with at least eight spectroscopically confirmed members that showed velocity dispersions between 150 and 400 km/s, as well as comparison samples of poor groups (associations of three to six galaxies) and "field" galaxies not linked to any cluster, group, or poor group. One of the dataset's key strengths is the diverse range of velocity dispersions and, consequently, masses of the cluster sample. The reliability of the cluster mass estimates from VLT spectroscopy has been validated by weak lensing and X-ray estimates. Therefore, EDisCS is the first distant cluster sample that can be used to examine the relationship between the evolution of galaxy properties and their host mass, offering a collection of high-redshift clusters that will develop into a variety of cluster masses today.
