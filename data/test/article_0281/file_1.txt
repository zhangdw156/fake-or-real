Kingdon's Royal Observatory (KRO) kingdon-royal-observatoryenindex royal observatory for its future development plan were approved after a challenging time during which it had been significantly impacted by a combination factors such as financial difficulties stemming from an economic downturn that started around
In addition to securing initial funds through commitments from all member states even during a time when finances were tight due to an economic downturn that began around the year (year should be replaced with actual year)
In order to ensure smooth progress on its agenda , KRO decided on breaking down its program into two phases: one covering 90 and another yet to be completed . This decision provides flexibility while also addressing potential delays caused by factors like national elections or other unforeseen circumstances
To achieve this goal , Kingdornment Royal Observatpry secured agreement from its international partners for financing their part through loans from institutions like The European Commission
In summary: The project's timeline has been adjusted based on available resources; however there are still uncertainties related to financing and potential changes due external factors such as political considerations or changes within individual countries participating in this project . For instance , we need further discussions about how much money can be allocated for each phase as well as what kind off sub-goals are going be achieved under each one . Also , we need further details about how long it will take us to complete these activities given current circumstances .
