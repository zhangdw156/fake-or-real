Despite a global economic downturn (the financial crisis), European governments approved a major construction plan for Europe's Large Telescope (ELT) back in December 2012. Two years later they decided to split this project into two phases due to various factors including political considerations like Poland joining as a partner nation. This initial phase received its green light and will be completed independently from Brazil joining as an EU member state due at that time; it also benefits from Poland's involvement . In June 2016 a key decision was made: approving contracts related to Phase One by early 'sunrise' date - in hopes that it can be achieved within budget while utilizing available funds through European Investment Bank credit line . To manage long-term expectations about how this telescope will be developed over time , we need an overview plan outlining how everything will unfold across fifteen years ; this includes organizational changes , financial projections , potential risks involved , alternative funding strategies for Phase Two , future opportunities beyond basic program goals finally assessing ESOs overall model itself .
