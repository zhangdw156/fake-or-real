Doppler shifts in spectral lines caused by low-mass companions are not expected to change the shape of the spectral lines or be linked to changes in indicators of stellar activity. By measuring the stars' projected rotational velocities and estimating their radii, we can calculate their rotational periods and see if they differ significantly from the orbital periods of their companions. This will help us rule out rotational modulation as a cause of radial velocity variations. So far, we have identified three stars that have companions. These cooler evolved stars are located in the clump region, where they undergo core helium burning after ascending the red giant branch (RGB). Clump giants spend about 10â€“20% of their main-sequence lifetime at this stage. Comparing them with theoretical evolutionary tracks helps us determine their stellar mass, which we found to be around 1.9 solar masses. This finding is significant because it indicates that analyzing evolved stars allows us to investigate planet formation in a different range of stellar masses compared to radial velocity surveys focused on main-sequence stars, which are limited to those less massive than about 1.3 solar masses. Our high-quality FEROS data enable us to obtain accurate metallicities for these stars. Besides metallicity ([Fe/H]), we also determined their effective temperatures and surface gravities (log g). Interestingly, we discovered that the three stars suspected to have planets are not metal-rich. Research on host stars of exoplanets around main-sequence stars typically shows that these stars have higher metallicities than those without exoplanets. G-K giants appear to contradict this trend. However, a larger sample of planets orbiting K giant stars is necessary to establish any correlation with metallicity.
