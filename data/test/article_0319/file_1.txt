Analyzing data from deep infrared imaging (Ks band), researchers determined how well different methods estimate star populations based on color variations within galaxies using both optical (U V) light measurements from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data combined with infrared data obtained via Wide Field Camera Three (WFC3).
They found that including K band measurements improved accuracy within certain ranges but became less reliable above z2 due to limitations imposed on estimates based on redder wavelengths beyond what was captured by HST's filters used for this analysis.. The analysis revealed significant differences between estimates made solely using visible light versus those including infrared data when analyzing galaxies above z2 because they were affected differently due to varying wavelengths captured by different instruments
This suggests that combining multiple datasets like Frontier Fields Hubble observations along with Infrared cameras provides better insights into complex evolution processes occurring within these specific types of galaxies over time which can also help us understand their future behavior better .
