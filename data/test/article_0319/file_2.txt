underground imaging data helped us understand how accurately we can measure distances to distant galaxies using their colors (brightness across different wavelengths). We found that including data from our deeper K band (near infrared) improves our ability to determine distance when considering objects below z2 but becomes less reliable for older or more distant galaxies (z2). This means there's potential for errors when combining data solely from existing space telescopes like Hubble or Spitzer because they don't capture enough detail about those very distant objects! We also found that adding K band data helps us pinpoint specific features within an object's light spectrum - like seeing if it has evolved into something else over time - so this new combination dataset holds great potential to contribute valuable insights into understanding these distant evolved galaxies!
