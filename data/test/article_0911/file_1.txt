The next phase in the development of a large star as it moves toward being a main-sequence star is called the hot-core stage. In this stage, massive stars are found within dense cores of molecular clouds and are generally unseen in the infrared and near-infrared due to high levels of extinguishment. They can only be observed in the mid-infrared spectrum. These superconducting cores are heated by surrounding massive stars to temperatures ranging from 100 to 300 Kelvin and measure about 0.1 parsecs across, holding a density of around 10 million hydrogen molecules per cubic centimeter. At this stage, the young massive stars usually do not yet possess significant amounts of ionized hydrogen around them, as the rapid infall of mass may prevent the creation of Hii regions. Thus, the youngest massive stars can primarily be detected in the thermal infrared and sub-millimeter wavelength ranges, despite being weak sources for centimetre radio continuity. An interesting case is the G9.62+0.19-F Hot Core, represented in Figure 2, for which we conducted a comprehensive study using ISAAC at the VLT and TIMMI2 at the ESO 3.6 m telescope. Traditional models have suggested that these hot cores should not be visible through ISAAC (which has a wavelength range of 1–5 µm) due to significant visual obstruction. However, our previous work has shown that the G9.62 hot core propels a considerable molecular outflow aligned with our perspective, potentially disruptinging the usual spherical shape. Our observations at 3.8 µm and 4.7 µm reveal features absent at shorter wavelengths that eventually lead the longer wavelengths' emissions. This suggests that the outflow lets the thermal infrared radiation from inside the hot core escape more readily. Consequently, this supports the inference that the symmetrical model should be adjusted in sophisticated radiative transfer models. Accurate astrometric measurements are necessary for the reliability of aligning thermal infrared and radio interferometry images to avoid false identifications. Furthermore, combined with millimetre interferometer data, our new high-resolution thermal infrared images can provide a primary estimate of the hot core's luminosity as approximately 1.9 times that of the sun. This is a strong indication that the G9.62 hot core accommodates a young massive star. However, it's essential to be cautious as seen in G9.62's counterpart, the Orion Hot Core, where several infrared sources emerge in a smaller scenario. Thus, high-resolution L- and M-band observations with NACO are pivotal in exploring possible substructures in this hot core.
