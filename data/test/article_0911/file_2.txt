The next phase in the development of a large star as it moves toward the main sequence is known as the hot-core stage. In this stage, massive stars are found within dense cores of molecular clouds and are not visible in the infrared or near-infrared due to high extinction; instead, they can be seen in the mid-infrared. The cores are heated by the massive stars nearby to temperatures between 100 and 300 Kelvin, resulting in "hot cores" that are about 0.1 parsecs across and have a molecular hydrogen density of about 10 million particles per cubic centimeter. At this point, the objects typically do not have significant amounts of ionized hydrogen surrounding them, as the formation of Hii regions may be hindered by the high mass infall rate. Consequently, the youngest massive stars can only be detected in the thermal infrared and (sub-)millimeter range, rather than being strong sources of centimeter radio continuum. The G9.62+0.19-F Hot Core is an interesting example, which we studied using ISAAC at the VLT and TIMMI2 at the ESO 3.6-m telescope. Classical models suggest hot cores should not be detectable with ISAAC (1–5 µm range) due to extreme visual extinction. However, we found that the G9.62 hot core drives a significant molecular outflow oriented toward our line of sight, disrupting the expected spherical symmetry. Our observations at 3.8 µm and 4.7 µm reveal a feature not seen at shorter wavelengths that eventually dominates the longer wavelengths' emission. This suggests the outflow has a "clearing effect," allowing thermal infrared radiation from within the hot core to escape through the outflow cone. This observation highlights the need to account for deviations from spherical symmetry in radiative transfer models. Accurate astrometry, especially between thermal infrared images and radio interferometry data, is crucial to avoid misidentifications. Our new sub-arc-second thermal infrared data, when combined with existing millimeter interferometer data, helps us estimate the luminosity of this hot core to be around 1.9 times that of the Sun, indicating the presence of a young massive star. However, caution is warranted, as seen with the Orion Hot Core, where several infrared sources can be distinguished at a much smaller scale. Thus, high-resolution L- and M-band observations with NACO will be a necessary next step to explore potential substructures in this hot core.
