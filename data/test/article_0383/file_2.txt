This survey captured images of stars (Z, Y, J, H, Ks) taken over 14 nights between October 16th and November 2nd, 2009. The survey area encompassed 20 regions in the VISTA constellation (covering a total of 30 square degrees).  Observations were conducted sequentially for each region, with an effort to repeatedly image each individual region. A special focus was placed on the 25 Ori young stellar group, where images of this cluster were taken up to 23 times, to study its variability in brightness across different types of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. The observing strategy, exposure times per filter, and specific observation patterns are outlined in a previous publication by Arnaboldi et al. (2010).  The data from the VISTA Orion Survey is approximately 559 gigabytes, presenting challenges for handling and processing all of this massive information. To process the collected images and create accessible outputs for astronomers, a dedicated program named VDFS was used by CASU. This program creates scientifically useful images (stacked) and produces catalogs containing accurate astrometric data, as well as calibrated source identifications. 3.2 million individual star sources were detected in the VISTA Orion Survey, with photometric calibration based on 2MASS observations. The overall accuracy of the photometry is typically below 5%, and the minimum detectable brightness was found to be around Z ~ 22.5 mag, Y ~ 21.2 mag, J ~ 20.4 mag, H ~ 19.4 mag, Ks ~ 18.6 mag for different parts of the survey with varying observing conditions impacting their limits. The survey significantly improved detection in areas focused on the σ Ori cluster with Z- and J-band images achieving 5σ limits of Z ~ 22.9 mag and J ~ 21.4 mag.  To ensure accurate completeness estimates, artificial stars were added to each image, based on statistics of redetected stars. This revealed that the survey would effectively detect almost all objects smaller than about six Jupiter masses in a relatively dark region with less than 1 magnitude of interstellar extinction within the survey area.
