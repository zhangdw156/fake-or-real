ymce explanation
Is there life beyond Earth? Scientists want answers about if other worlds resemble our own planet - those we call "habitable."
One key piece for finding out would be observing exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) closely enough for us see their atmospheres using powerful ground based or space based instruments like NASA's James Webb Space Telescope or ESA's Extremely Large Telescope (ELT).
Star types called "ultra cool dwarfs" may hold secrets: they are much smaller than our sun but still have warm enough environments where some life might be able too exist! These types offer opportunities for finding out about other potential living world because they orbit close enough for us see them quite regularly as they pass between their parent Star us . They also produce much stronger signals when passing by making it easier for scientists observe them even from earth!
The project "SPECULOOS" uses several robotic telescopes spread across different locations on earth which will help find out what kind atmosphere these potentially living world have through observation techniques like measuring light dimsining as they pass between their parent Star us . This could give clues about whether there might be signs suggesting life exists on those distant worlds!
