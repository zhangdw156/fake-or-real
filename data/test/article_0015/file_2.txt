Scientists wonder if other worlds like Earth exist beyond our solar system (the universe). The best way we can find out might be through finding exoplanets orbiting close enough for us to study their atmospheres using advanced telescopes like those being built now by ESO or NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
Ultracool dwarf (UCD) stars are particularly promising because they're smaller than our sun but still emit enough light for us observe them from Earth with powerful ground based telescopes like those planned for use by SPECULOOS project starting soon! These smaller suns have super short orbits around their parent star giving us better chances at spotting these distant worlds! We can then analyze their atmosphere looking for signs life might exist there - "biosignatures".
