We used the XXL-100-GC sample to calculate preliminary estimations about the universe's expansion. Our measurements of luminosity and temperature allowed us to create models based on predicted cluster counts using our current cosmological parameters. The study found that the number density of clusters is less than predicted by Planck data after accounting for factors related to the XXL selection process; this discrepancy is similar to findings observed in Planck's Sunyaevâ€“Zeldovich detected sample but occurs at a lower mass range. However, the alternative Nine Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe model is not perfect and still overestimates cluster counts. Our efforts to evaluate the cosmological significance of this sample showed that even with our current subset, uncertainties in estimating cluster masses outweigh other limitations. Therefore, obtaining reliable cluster masses for most XXL clusters will be a significant focus area in future XXL research endeavors. We've initiated a collaborative effort with the Subaru Hyper-SuprimeCam team for accurate lensing masses estimation, which is expected to enhance the overall study results significantly.
