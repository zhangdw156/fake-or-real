After analyzing new data, we have determined luminosities for a total of 36 LMC Cepheids with periods ranging from 3 to 80 days, and can apply the PL relation (an equation relating luminosity to other properties) in all observed photometric bands. For Milky Way Cepheids, we analyzed an additional 70 fundamental mode Cepheids using new radial velocity measurements obtained with a spectrograph on the STELLA robotic telescope. These two samples show similar slopes for the PL relation, and there's no significant evidence to suggest that these slopes differ. This is crucial for applying the PL relation as a standard for extragalactic stars, especially since our previous work suggested an effect might exist.  We compare the luminosities of the stars from both samples with those re-analyzed using the exact same procedure. Figure 3 shows the offset from the mean PL relation in the K-band and Wesenheit index. The Wesenheit index is a reddening-insensitive color index that was also used by the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project for measuring extragalactic distances. We find a significant effect, where metal-poor stars are fainter than metal-rich stars by approximately 0.23 to -0.1 mag per dex. This effect is similar to that found by the Key Project group. Our method provides independent confirmation of their findings. In the K-band, this effect is significantly smaller and a null effect in the data suggests there may be no such effect at all.  Expanding the sample of SMC stars could help strengthen the constraint on metallicity; this would likely provide the strongest possible result currently available.
