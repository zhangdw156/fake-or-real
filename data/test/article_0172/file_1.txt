TiIDES is designed specifically for studying supernovae and active galactic nuclei using data collected by large telescopes like LSTSS across southern hemisphere skies:
Targetting Live Transients: TiIDES aims at capturing all bright transient events within designated "fields" observed by both wide surveys like LSTSS's deep wide fast mode ("rolling cadence") and narrower focused surveys ("DDFs"). It plans repeated observation periods during its operation period which could vary due pending changes regarding LSTSS observing strategies area optimization over future months years ahead .
Transient Selection: It selects "live" transient events based upon brightness levels above magnitude r23; it uses no color filters but might prioritize further analysis based upon their unique characteristics like unusual behavior or early stages compared against brighter counterparts..
Host Selection: For supernovae classifications associated with specific galaxies ("hosts"), it prioritizes those whose light curves are complete when captured through LSTSS's observations; This process increases over long periods due increasing data availability about galaxy evolution within each surveyed region..
AGNs Preselection: To study active galactic nuclei candidates within targeted regions designated by LSTSS Deep Drilling Fields , first an initial spectrum assessment helps identify potential candidates suitable for further analysis via reverberation mapping techniques..
Overall: This project involves observing various astronomical phenomena across vast areas using multiple telescopes while utilizing sophisticated methods like spectroscopy detailed timing measurements across multiple nights throughout its operational period .
