During its commissioning, APEX's first point of observation was NGC 253, which, along with M82, is considered a typical nuclear starburst galaxy. Due to its closeness of under 10 million light years in the southern constellation of Sculptor, APEX can distinguish its central gas layer. Figure 9 shows the emission from the CO J = 4–3 rotational transition (at a wavelength of 650 µm) overlaid on an optical image of the galaxy. By mapping various CO and atomic carbon lines, researchers can analyze the gas's density and temperature in this unique setting. From the modeling of CO(4–3) and CO(7–6), we find a kinetic temperature of 60 K and an H2 density of approximately 10^4 cm–3 in the central gas layer. The submillimeter rotational transitions of CO are identified as the primary cooling lines for the warm, dense interstellar gas, peaking at J = 6–5 for the central 250 parsecs of NGC 253. These initial observations of a nearby starburst nucleus highlight APEX's ability to examine gas excitation in these regions. With upcoming wider band spectrometers and a chopping secondary, combined with the excellent observing conditions at the site, this facility is expected to greatly influence extragalactic astronomy.
