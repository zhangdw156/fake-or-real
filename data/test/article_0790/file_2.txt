During its commissioning, APEX's first point of observation was NGC 253, which, together with M82, is considered an archetypical nuclear starburst galaxy. Located less than 10 million light years away in the southern constellation of Sculptor, APEX is capable of resolving its central gas layer. In Figure 9, we show the CO J = 4–3 rotational transition emission (at a wavelength of 650 µm) over an optical image of the galaxy. By mapping various CO and atomic carbon lines, we can analyze the gas's density and temperature in this unique context. Through modeling the excitation of CO(4–3) and CO(7–6), we determine a kinetic temperature of 60 K and H2 density of approximately 10^4 cm–3 for the central gas layer. The submillimeter rotational transitions of CO are found to be key cooling lines for the warm, dense interstellar gas, peaking at J = 6–5 for the central 250 parsecs of NGC 253. These initial observations of a nearby starburst nucleus highlight APEX's ability to examine the gas excitation in these centers. With more advanced spectrometers and soon-to-come technical enhancements, along with the excellent observing conditions at the facility's location, APEX is poised to significantly impact extragalactic astronomy.
