An additional potential bias in the IBW and IRSB methods for measuring the distance of Cepheid stars is the discovery of a circumstellar envelope. These envelopes show a distinctive signature in the H-alpha line profiles. We analyzed the H-alpha line profiles for all stars using a two-dimensional representation that plots wavelength against pulsation phase. For each star, we calculated an average spectral line profile, its first moment (gamma-velocity), and its asymmetry (gamma-asymmetry). Short period Cepheids exhibit H-alpha line profiles that closely match the pulsating envelope of the star, while long period Cepheids display much more complex line profiles and significant asymmetries. For the Cepheid l Car, we identified a prominent absorption component with a nearly zero velocity in the star's rest frame, which is linked to the circumstellar envelope. In other Cepheids, the central component is likely too faint to detect in our spectra. Notably, we discovered a new correlation between the periods of Cepheids and their H-alpha gamma-velocities and gamma-asymmetries. In contrast, the gamma-asymmetries of metallic lines are a few percent and decrease with the Cepheid's period, while the gamma-asymmetries for H-alpha line profiles increase with the period, reaching about twenty percent for long period Cepheids. Thus, we propose that the gamma-asymmetries (or gamma-velocities) of metallic and H-alpha lines arise from different physical processes. Although the gamma-velocities of H-alpha line profiles may partly result from the dynamic structure of the Cepheid atmosphere, it is also plausible that there is some mass loss from Cepheids, with typical velocities along the line of sight of up to negative twenty kilometers per second. A striking instance of circumstellar material around a Cepheid is the large light-scattering nebula associated with the long period Cepheid RS Pup. Additionally, strong pulsational compression of atmospheric layers and shock waves have been observed in the short period Cepheid X Sgr, which is included in our HARPS sample alongside RS Pup.
