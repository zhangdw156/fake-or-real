Examining the Near-Infrared with High Spatial and Spectral Detail: Initial Findings from CRIRES Science Verification

The VLT's CRIRES is a highly advanced cryogenic infrared echelle spectrograph that provides excellent spatial, spectral, and temporal spectroscopy across the range of 1 to 5 μm. Key results from 29 pilot studies conducted during CRIRES science verification (SV) runs are summarized. Placed at the Nasmyth focus A of UT1 (Antu), CRIRES has a resolving power of up to 100,000 within its specified spectral range. This instrument significantly enhances scientific research focusing on fainter objects, greater spatial resolution (especially for extended sources), as well as spectral and temporal fidelity. It achieves extensive spectral coverage by using a mosaic of four Aladdin III InSb arrays, which together form an effective 4096 × 512 pixel detector in the focal plane. Additionally, a MACAO system—Multi-Applications Curvature Adaptive Optics—can enhance both spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. The diverse scientific capabilities of CRIRES are evidenced by various results amassed during three separate science verification observation campaigns held in August, October 2006, and February 2007. The 29 pilot studies were allocated a total observation time of 20,000 seconds. The research topics include investigations into Earth's atmosphere, the structure of disks around young stars, brown dwarfs, exoplanets, oscillation and wind properties of massive stars, asymptotic giant branch stars, Galactic structure, and astroseismology. This article presents some significant findings, organized to start with distant young stars, brown dwarfs, and planets before discussing massive stars and Asymptotic Giant Branch stars, concluding with targets beyond our Galaxy. Issues regarding CRIRES calibration are also addressed.
