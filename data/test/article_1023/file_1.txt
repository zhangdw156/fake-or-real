Examining the Near-Infrared with High Spatial and Spectral Detail: Initial Findings from CRIRES Science Verification

The VLT's CRIRES is a highly sensitive infrared spectrograph that operates in the wavelength range of 1 to 5 μm, providing excellent spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. This article summarizes key findings from 29 initial studies conducted during the CRIRES science verification runs. Located at the Nasmyth focus A of UT1 (Antu), CRIRES achieves a resolving power of up to 100,000 within this wavelength range. It enhances scientific research on fainter objects and improves spatial resolution for extended sources, along with temporal and spectral resolution. Its spectral coverage uses a combination of four Aladdin III InSb arrays to form a 4096 × 512 detector array. A MACAO (Multi-Applications Curvature Adaptive Optics) system can further improve spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. The potential of the CRIRES instrument is illustrated by numerous findings from three science verification campaigns conducted in August, October 2006, and February 2007. The 29 pilot studies received a total of 20,000 seconds of observing time. Projects included research on Earth's atmosphere, structures around young stars, brown dwarfs, exoplanets, and the properties of massive stars, asymptotic giant branch stars, galaxy structure, and astroseismology. This article presents highlights of these projects, starting with young stars, brown dwarfs, and planets, then moving to massive and asymptotic giant branch stars, and finally to targets beyond the Galaxy. Calibration issues related to CRIRES are also discussed.
