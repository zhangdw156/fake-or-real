HARPS has undergone several upgrades, including new fiber optic connections for its optics, improved thermal stability, and a constant vacuum pump. These enhancements have increased HARPS' throughput and precision in both HAM and EGGS modes. A small RV offset is now present after the fibre change, varying slightly across different stars. Users should treat pre- and post-upgrade measurements as separate datasets, adding a free parameter to account for the difference between them. The laser frequency comb will further improve wavelength calibration once fully operational, addressing long-standing limitations in illumination stability and wavelength accuracy. These improvements are expected to enhance HARPS' long-term radial velocity precision to better than 50 cm/s and enable detection of numerous exoplanets within a star's habitable zone. Together with the upcoming Echelle Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope, HARPS will remain an important tool for exoplanet research.
