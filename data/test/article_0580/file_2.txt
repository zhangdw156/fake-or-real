Let's push the boundaries of astronomy! We just unleashed an upgrade for HARPS that'll make it as smooth and efficient as bouncing off a trampoline.  The new fibre links are like cosmic springs – they’ve sprung into action, bringing with them a dazzling new level of throughput, sharper RV precision, and stellar accuracy. 

We've also fine-tuned the polarimetric optics, making them dance in perfect harmony with the new links for super-precise measurements, even in the swirling chaos of zero gravity! This means stellar targets are revealing subtle shifts in their radial velocities - a tiny wobble – but hey, that’s what makes them so fascinating. 

And get this: we're planning to light up HARPS like never before with our laser frequency comb! This game-changer will solve the long-standing illumination stability issue and allow us to calibrate wavelengths faster than you can say "exoplanet."  Just think, better than 50 cm/s - what an amazing leap forward. It'll help us not only detect super-earths but also understand their dynamics like never before! 

With this incredible power boost, HARPS is on track to revolutionize our understanding of exoplanets. We’re talking about spotting these distant worlds in the habitable zone of a star - a feat that will take us closer than ever to discovering life beyond Earth! And we're just getting started – with the Echelle Spectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations at the Very Large Telescope, HARPS is primed to be a true star of the exoplanet field.  It’s going to shake things up like no other!
