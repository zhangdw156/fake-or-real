SINFONI's two-dimensional spectroscopic data allows us to study how galaxies move at a redshift of approximately 3.3 in our sample by measuring the velocity shift of the brightest line, [O iii] 5007 Angstroms. About 30 percent of galaxies exhibit ordered rotational motions, with examples illustrated where rotation curves and [O iii] flux maps are presented. Contrary to previous findings that metallicity increases in massive galaxies with higher star formation rates at lower redshifts (greater than 0 and less than 2.5), we found no correlation between the dynamical properties of these massive galaxies at redshift approximately 3.3 and their deviation from this relation. Notably, a significant number of such galaxies exhibit irregular kinematics likely caused by mergers alongside regular rotation curves in equal amounts. Therefore, merging alone cannot solely explain the observed lower gas metallicity in these early galaxies.  The rotation curves allow for estimating dynamical masses within the range of 2 x 10<sup>9</sup> to 2 x 10<sup>11</sup> solar masses. These estimations suggest that some massive rotating discs are present at this early stage in the universe. However, at redshift approximately 3.3 these discs are much more turbulent than local disc galaxies. The velocity dispersion is generally comparable with the rotational velocity, and the average ratio between rotational velocity and velocity dispersion is less than Vmax divided by sigma at redshift 3.3 equals 2.2 compared to values less than Vmax divided by sigma at redshift 0 equal to 10 typical of local discs. Galaxies at this redshift appear even more turbulent than those investigated at redshift approximately 2 in a parallel SINFONI program, which has an average ratio of less than Vmax divided by sigma at redshift 2 equals 4.5. The high turbulence of these discs at redshift approximately 3.3 is likely attributed to high gas fractions, which make the discs dynamically unstable. Evidence for high gas fractions has been confirmed through carbon monoxide observations at redshifts greater than 1 and less than 2.5, though some indirect evidence for this characteristic has been gathered through the high surface density of star formation and comparing dynamic and stellar masses at redshift approximately 3.3. These high gas fractions are likely linked to predicted cold inflows of gas observed in earlier theoretical models.
