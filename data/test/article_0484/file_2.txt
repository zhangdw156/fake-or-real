Turns out, those cat-loving astronomers have been studying our nearby galaxies and it seems like their feline companions are also interested in galactic mechanics! 

The SINFONI instrument is helping us peek into these cosmic giants at a distance of about 3.3 times farther than Earth.  What they see are shifts in the brightest lines, like those caused by [O iii] 5007 Angstroms – and this tells them how quickly stars and gas are moving within these galaxies! A third of the galaxies show some kind of organized rotation (imagine a cat chasing its tail on a spinning wheel!)

These rotating systems have been explored in detail, with central panels showing their rotation curves alongside maps of [O iii] emission. But there's another twist –  we found that these stars and gas haven't magically "upsized" or changed their properties compared to our observations from further away! 

But what about all this cosmic action? It turns out some galaxies, at these distances, have a crazy turbulent mix of star formation! We can see this in the way they rotate. Their velocity dispersion often matches (or even exceeds!) the rotational speed. It's like watching two cats spinning around and around a yarn ball – it's quite wild to observe!  

The key takeaway? These early galaxies are much more chaotic than their neighbors at closer distances, but that could be due to a heavy concentration of gas in these swirling discs - think a cat toy with tons of fluffy stuff packed into it. We have some clues about this based on star formation and the way things look in these early galactic systems!
