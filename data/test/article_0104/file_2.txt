Using detailed analysis called "spectral fitting," researchers can determine how stars have formed over time across different areas within galaxies observed with MUSE instruments (like those shown in Figure 2). Analyzing these patterns reveals valuable information about when disks (spiral arms) settle into place or when bars (spiral arms shaped like bars) develop within galaxies like NGC 1097 or NGC 4371 .
For example:
NGC 1097: Shows a mature nucleus with older stars rich in metals surrounded by a younger region with less heavy elements - suggesting efficient gas trapping by this young ring structure around its center due to its high density compared to surrounding regions
NGC 4371: Highlights how newly forming bars can lead to rapid development around their centers through both active processes like creating rings around them as well as passive evolution after initial formation
These findings challenge previous assumptions about how these galactic features form because they suggest not all structures built through these mechanisms are equally young; instead they may vary significantly depending on their environment or history involving interactions between other nearby objects such as clusters where environments could limit gas supply for new star formation .
