The combination of accurate chemical analysis of solar twins and precise measurements of planetary radial velocities allows us to study the relationship between planets and their stars with unprecedented detail. Using the sun as a reference point is crucial, since it's the only known star hosting a planet where life has been observed. Our four-year project leverages this advantage by using the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planetary Searcher (HARP) to search for planets around these specific solar twins and then employs high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise spectra from the Magellan Telescope to determine stellar properties and chemical composition of our chosen sample. These observations are taken over a short period, averaging out star oscillations below detection limits. Detailed modeling of stellar activity is then performed since this activity can induce radial velocity variations that could mimic the effect of planets; these patterns are tested to see if they are truly due to planets or other factors.
