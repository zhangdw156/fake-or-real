## The Solar Twins: A Cosmic Dance with Unprecedented Precision 

“It's not a question of science fiction,” Bowie croons in “Space Oddity”. “There’s no point of being scared, just curious.” This is precisely what we're striving for with our groundbreaking study of the planet–star connection.  The dance between accurate chemical composition analysis through Solar Twins and the pinpoint precision of radial velocity measurements provides us with a new dawn in planetary exploration.

Think of it this way:  we’re peering through a kaleidoscope, revealing the intricate details of celestial interactions like never before. Just as Bowie's lyrics speak to our yearning for understanding the cosmos, we are exploring how planets relate to their stars – a cosmic symphony played out across light years. 

The use of our very own Sun, where life thrives on its surface, forms the cornerstone of this exploration. "Living in a cardboard box," writes David Bowie about his journey to Earth’s cradle in *The Next Day*, capturing this intimate connection between star and planet. We're employing a powerful technique: The High Accuracy Radial velocity Planetary Searcher, our weapon of choice in a four-year quest.

“I was only dancing,” Bowie sings in "Space Oddity" – a simple truth that echoes the vastness of our endeavor.  To capture this dance with precision, we are using high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise spectra from the Magellan Telescope to unlock the secrets of our Solar Twin sample. We're meticulously analyzing their stellar parameters and precise chemical composition, all captured within a time frame of mere minutes – an orchestra of data that takes us closer to deciphering these celestial events.

But our exploration is not without challenges! As with Bowie’s own space-faring anxieties, we must navigate the complexities of stellar activity. Just as he writes in "Fame," “you know you can’t escape it.” These variations in a star's motion could be mistaken for planetary influences, and meticulous modelling allows us to separate the signal from noise, ensuring a reliable investigation into planet-star connections.


Through our dedicated research, we are unlocking the secrets of how planets exist in harmony with their stars, guided by Bowie’s lyrical insights: "You can stay alive or you can die". As we delve deeper, it's clear that this journey to understanding the planet-star connection is a cosmic dance for the ages.
