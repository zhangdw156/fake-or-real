Our planet search includes monitoring very low-mass stars.  Additionally, we have observed Proxima Centauri and Barnard's Star to verify the accuracy of our cell and radial velocity measurement algorithms. These stars are among a few for which high-precision radial velocity measurements are possible in visible wavelengths because they are nearby and relatively bright. Previous research has shown their radial velocities to be constant at around 3 meters per second. Our data collected between February 2009 and February 2010 show a typical root mean square (rms) scatter about a constant value of approximately 5 meters per second, demonstrating a significant advancement in near-infrared radial velocity precision for very low-mass stars using the CRIRES instrument with its ammonia cell. More detailed information on our radial velocity measurement technique and extensive precision tests are provided in Bean et al. (2010b).
