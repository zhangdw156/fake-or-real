In this session, the negative effects of feedback, specifically the destruction of clusters, were discussed. When a molecular cloud collapses and breaks apart into a star cluster, only a small portion of the gas is converted into stars. The energy from stellar winds, photoionization, and supernovae from massive stars quickly removes gas (in less than the time it takes for the cluster to move across). This fast removal can cause a cluster to be significantly out of balance. If star formation is inefficient enough (~30% of the initial gas turns into stars), the entire cluster may become gravitationally unbound. Nate Bastian reviewed the physics behind this process and recent observations, particularly recent simulations examining the impact of gas removal on cluster evolution. He also looked at attempts to measure the rate of young cluster loss, with many studies indicating that 60–90% of young clusters are disrupted within the first 40 million years. Sabine Mengel focused on the young massive cluster Westerlund 1, concluding that its star formation efficiency was very high (>60%). Dieter Nürnberger examined another young massive cluster, NGC 3603, and based on multi-wavelength observations, he noted that this cluster is part of a larger region of star formation. He also demonstrated how the high-mass stars in this cluster influence the interstellar medium and nearby young sources.
