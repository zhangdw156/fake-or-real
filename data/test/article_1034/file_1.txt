In this session, negative feedback effects, such as the destruction of star clusters, were discussed. When a molecular cloud collapses and breaks apart into a star cluster, only a small percentage of its gas is converted into stars. The energy released from stellar winds, photoionisation, and supernova explosions of massive stars is enough to remove gas very quickly (in less than the time it takes for the stars to cross the cluster). This rapid loss of gas can cause a cluster to become far from equilibrium. If about 30% of the gas becomes stars, the entire cluster can lose its gravitational binding. Nate Bastian reviewed the physics behind this process and recent observations, particularly recent simulations examining the impact of gas removal on cluster evolution. He reported that most studies find that 60-90% of young clusters are disrupted in their first 40 million years. Sabine Mengel focused on the young massive cluster Westerlund 1, determining that its star-formation efficiency was fairly high (over 60%). Dieter NÃ¼rnberger examined another young massive cluster, NGC 3603, and noted that it resides in a larger region of star formation. He provided examples showing how the high-mass stars in the cluster influence the interstellar medium and nearby young star systems.
