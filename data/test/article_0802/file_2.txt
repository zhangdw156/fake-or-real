In December 2008, a large group of VLT multi-fibre spectrograph facility, FLAMES users met at ESO Headquarters to share scientific achievements after six years of FLAMES operations. This gathering provided an excellent opportunity to evaluate FLAMES' impact on various areas of astrophysical research and for ESO to understand the current and future requirements of FLAMES users. We summarize the two-and-a-half-day meeting, in which participants shared their experiences and expertise with FLAMES. FLAMES has successfully operated for six years as part of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the La Silla Paranal Observatory. Its large field of view combined with numerous diverse fibres, totaling 1.6 km if lined up, makes FLAMES a unique asset in ground-based astronomy. Due to its flexibility, FLAMES can serve many astronomical purposes, including extrasolar planet discovery, analysis of chemical abundances in star groups, studying kinematics and dark matter, examining planetary nebulae, surveying the interstellar medium, and exploring stellar evolution. We felt it was important to review FLAMES' performance over these six years. After the positive experience with UVES nearly six years ago, FLAMES users were invited to an informal workshop at ESO Headquarters in December 2008, and it was encouraging to see nearly all teams that had used FLAMES present. Participants presented their scientific findings and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of using FLAMES for their research, which were compiled for the final discussion. Additionally, some technical talks were given by community members, and the FLAMES Instrument and Operations Team shared usage statistics. Over the six years of operation, approximately 9000 science frames were obtained, averaging 100 objects per image, equating to around 400 nights of VLT time. This accounts for about 25% of the time available on Kueyen and is similar to the proportion of UT2 time requested when submitting proposals.
