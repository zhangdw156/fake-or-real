It's as if ancient civilizations gifted us with spaceships, capable of whisking us straight to the Moon – that's how vast the universe of proposals is before ESA!  

For decades, scientists have been sending over a thousand requests every six months to explore our cosmos through ESO, hoping to secure their piece of the cosmic pie. The number keeps climbing, thanks to new astronomers joining in, more facilities popping up like daisies in the garden and that very special ingredient: a whole lot of PIs with ambitious dreams!

ESO, bless their curious hearts, uses a classic peer-review system – an intricate dance where the Director General picks and chooses the best projects. This process is a testament to its dedication to scientific discovery.  The OPC panels and their esteemed members are the stars here, keeping the astronomical cosmos in check and serving as judges for our ambitious proposals! 

Yet, the sheer volume of these requests throws them into over overdrive – almost like trying to squeeze more water from an empty glass.  With all that talent on hand, you need a team of experts dedicated to reviewing every single proposal, just think about how many panels with six brilliant minds each would be needed if we had just as much space for our rockets! 

And the problem gets worse with oversubscription – imagine trying to fit an entire rocket in a tiny capsule!  It’s like having too many good ideas at once. The PI will inevitably resubmit their proposal, which only piles on the pressure. And that's when frustration sets in.  The users feel the sting, while the panel members suffer under the weight of a mountain of proposals. 

ESO is becoming a victim of its own success! It has found itself at an epic crossroads. 

And it's precisely here where the OPC Working Group (OPC-WG) steps into the limelight – like a superhero with special powers.  It has been tasked to find better ways to navigate these uncharted waters, ensuring that our journey through space is as efficient and fruitful as possible!
