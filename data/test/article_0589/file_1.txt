The KMOS near-infrared multi-object integral-field spectrometer was delivered to Chile in mid-2012 and started taking first observations at Paranal Observatory's skies in November 2012. This document describes the transportation process, including the arrival of the instrument, commissioning data collection, and some early results. KMOS is one of several advanced instruments designed for future observation, working alongside MUSE and SPHERE, to significantly enhance Paranal Observatory's capabilities over the next few years.

KMOS utilizes deployable integral field units to gather spatially resolved spectra for up to 24 targeted objects within a 7.2-arc-minute diameter field of view.  The instrument completed its “Provisional Acceptance Europe” milestone and then embarked on a long journey from its factory, first via road, sea, and air transport, until it reached Paranal Observatory.  A large auxiliary unit containing the instrument's electronic systems had to be transported by ship for this leg, since standard airfreight was insufficient in size.  The device arrived at Antofagasta port in good condition. 

Following reassembly at the integration hall at the observatory, KMOS underwent testing and calibration, conducted by a team of UK and German experts working alongside ESO personnel, taking eight weeks from September to November 2012. After verification tests, the instrument was transported to the final location on the Nasmyth platform at VLT Unit Telescope 1 (Antu), requiring lifting due to its size. First observations were conducted with a short exposure time of just 30 minutes using KMOS, showcasing its potential for future surveys.
