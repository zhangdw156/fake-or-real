Spectra used by astronomers across various fields like extragalactic studies rely heavily on existing libraries built based on real observations called "empirical" libraries because they offer practical solutions like identifying faint emission lines or measuring star movement within galaxies . While these libraries provide valuable tools for understanding stars' properties (like temperature), they often face limitations due to their low resolution or limited coverage compared with theoretical models which might not be accurate enough when it comes down predicting star colors accurately because they don't fully account for all factors such as complex molecules present in stars
A new project aims at creating an improved spectral library free from issues associated with slits used in traditional telescopes (slit losses) using advanced technology like MUSE IFU which offers higher precision than previous methods . This new library will cover diverse types of stars across different stages within their life cycle and serve as a benchmark against theoretical predictions allowing researchers better comparisons between them . The authors describe their initial findings after collecting data from over 30 MSL spectra , including those collected around one hundred XSL objects , along with two additional star systems discovered during observation process
