NASA's powerful computer simulations aren't always accurate when it comes predicting how real stars look or behave because they sometimes struggle with complex elements like light absorption or how light changes colour over time due to things like planetary rotation . These challenges mean that while NASA's simulations help us understand what real stars should be like based on their chemical makeup , they don't always perfectly predict their true appearance . NASA is working on creating more accurate predictions through new types of data collection methods that focus less space limitations but more accuracy by taking advantage of state-of-the art technologies such as high resolution cameras called "space telescopes" . In this study , they focused their efforts around making a new type of image archive called an "exquisitely detailed image archive" which would help them better understand how different types of star behave differently across different stages in life . They also wanted this archive could be used as a benchmark (a yardstick) against which future simulations could be compared so they know if there were any discrepancies between what was being predicted versus what was actually seen . In order for them achieve this goal , they decided use state -of -the -art technology including powerful telescopes called "multiuse flight instruments". Their first set was made up out 35 individual images taken by these instruments known collectively as flight instrument images."
