Most observations at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) are initiated by astronomers at their home institutions, assisted by ESO staff.  The remainder are carried out by ESO personnel on behalf of scientists. For all of these observations, a preliminary phase is completed beforehand using software provided by ESO. The remaining phase includes scheduling and constraints, which can be adjusted to account for factors like lunar phases and weather conditions such as PWV (predicted visibility). These observations are arranged into manageable units called "observation blocks" (OBs), each lasting up to one hour. After preparing these OBs, the ESO's User Support Department checks them for consistency and strategy before release for execution at the VLT.  The astronomer can further specify how the target will be observed during execution, such as restricting the time of day based on lunar phases. The use of PWV (predicted visibility) is an example of how these OBs are being adjusted to align with specific parameters related to target observation. With each hour-long block executed independently, several blocks from multiple programs can be conducted consecutively within a single night. Due to the VLT's rapid switch between instruments, the flexibility of observing conditions at the telescope is significant and allows the support astronomer to respond to varying environmental factors. Currently, the ESO support astronomer selects the OBs for execution in real-time, assisted by scheduling tools that consider scientific priority and the probability that requested conditions such as PWV or seeing are realized. While this system currently works fairly well, it would be highly beneficial to develop a forecast of atmospheric conditions several hours ahead of time so that full night observations could be preplanned with advanced algorithms for even greater optimization of scientific output at all telescopes on Paranal. In the case of PWV specifically, an accuracy level within a 1.0 mm range can provide general selection for OBs, while a level of 0.25 mm can allow for highly detailed scheduling. Since observations occur primarily during the night, this forecast should cover a period of eight to fourteen hours with twenty-four-hour advance notice.
