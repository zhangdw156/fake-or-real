The wide field-of-view of the WFI camera allows us to capture the entire cluster along with its surrounding area. The top part displays a contour plot of galaxy density down to about magnitude 22 overlaid on the X-ray image, while the bottom part shows a large map of galaxy distribution, extending beyond the virial radius of RXCJ 0014.3-3023. The peak of the galaxy density is situated at the main cluster. Galaxy and X-ray surface brightness distributions extend northwest and south, continuing a potential large-scale filamentary structure, where galaxy distribution occurs at a lower density threshold. Notably, there is a strong connection between the filaments and the cluster's internal structure, pending confirmation via spectroscopy. The largest subcluster is approaching the system from the northwest. The southern extension is associated with a low-entropy channel that connects the potential filament to the cluster center. We have seen similar attributes indicating former galactic group infall accompanied by low-entropy intergroup media originating from broader filamentary structures. Therefore, we gain insight into the accretion history of this cluster. Additionally, the presence of a giant radio halo around RXCJ 0014.3-3023, likely created by cosmic-ray acceleration in a past merger shock, supports the notion that this cluster has experienced a series of recent mergers beyond the one being observed.
