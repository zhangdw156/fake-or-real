The wide field-of-view of the WFI camera enables us to capture images of the entire cluster, including its infall region. The upper part displays a contour plot showing the galaxy density distribution down to about R 22 magnitude overlaid on the X-ray image, while the lower part provides a large-scale map of the galaxy distribution that extends beyond the virial radius of RXCJ 0014.3-3023. The highest concentration of galaxies is located at the center of the main cluster. The galaxy and X-ray surface brightness distributions extend northwest and south, suggesting a larger filamentary structure, with a lower density contour threshold revealing a similar galaxy distribution. There is a notable alignment between these filaments and the cluster's internal structure, though further spectroscopic analysis is needed for confirmation. The primary subcluster is approaching the system from the northwest. The southern extension connects to a low entropy pathway that links the potential filament to the cluster's center. We have observed similar features indicating former galaxy group infalls with a low entropy intergroup medium from the surrounding large-scale filament structure. This provides insight into the cluster's accretion history. Moreover, RXCJ 0014.3-3023 features a large radio halo, likely formed from cosmic-ray acceleration during a past merger shock, further indicating that this cluster has experienced additional mergers beyond the one currently observed.
