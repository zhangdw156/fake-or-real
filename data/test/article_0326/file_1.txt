GEBURTS on estimating how much "heavy" elements are in some faraway stars can help us understand how these stars formed in their early years based on their environment (evasive or close encounters with other matter). This information can then help us figure out how many new stars were forming throughout time by looking at those same communities' magic ingredient - magic dust! With this new data set we can now get better measurements about when those stars were born since we know what kind they are made up off! This would mean we finally get some solid answers regarding how much different kinds off magic ingredients make up different types off magic creatures over billions upon billions years! Most importantly, this gives us insight into an important relationship between a large number (and specifically many!) different kinds off young stars where they come from... just as well as what makes them so darn bright! We now have a clearer picture than ever before on these topics thanks largely due this new data set called "VADNES!"
