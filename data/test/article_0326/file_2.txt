Determining how much metals are present in distant galaxies helps us understand their past star formation activity and interactions with surrounding space (intergalactic medium). Accurate measurements are crucial because they can help us determine how fast stars are forming (star formation rate) without being confused by age or dust obscuring light from stars within those galaxies which affects how bright they appear in observations . Recent work has shown we can estimate these metals based on ultraviolet light coming from distant galaxies using stacked data sets which provides information about thousands or even millions individual galaxy clusters across a wide range of distances beyond what was previously possible . The VANDELS telescope project aims to measure these metals accurately in hundreds of distant galaxies across a specific range , offering unprecedented insights into how metals change over time as we observe them further away from Earth . This new data allows us also study how much matter there is compared with its metallic content , helping us better understand galaxy evolution by measuring their masses as well as their rate at forming new stars over time . This could potentially revolutionize our understanding by revealing more details about galaxy development over cosmological timescales thanks to this new tool available through this project .
