Using only space observations isn't enough for accurate analysis because they don't capture enough information about red galaxies that are very distant (z 3). The near infrared light from telescopes like Hubble is too weak compared to other wavelengths needed for accurate measurements about star populations within those distant galaxies . To get better accuracy we need deeper images in a specific part called "K" band which can be captured by powerful telescopes like VLT or even more advanced ones like MOSFIRE located elsewhere . This allows us more information about both galaxy ages and dust content within them making it easier study their evolution as time goes by . We then used these techniques with special filters specifically designed for such studies on different telescopes across different locations around our planet Earth to gather enough detailed information needed for further research into these distant cosmic objects .
