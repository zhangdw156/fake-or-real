The implementation of active optics was a significant part of the job's goals. This involved demonstrating the effectiveness of newly developed concepts for supporting both the primary and secondary mirrors, which was relatively straightforward.  After a few nights of work, we successfully converted the Shack–Hartmann aberration angles into the required coordinates, allowing us to close the active optics loop and begin reducing aberration observed on panels. However, an unforeseen problem arose later, revealed by a sensor error affecting the non-common path. This caused distortions in measurements but could be rectified through software changes. A second major improvement was needed: due to the lack of a passive system for automatically compensating for weight shifts in the primary mirror support, incorrect forces were applied to the fixed points causing trefoil aberration. To resolve this issue, a background software task that ensures continuous stability of the system was implemented, eliminating the source of the problem and enabling operation within all possible scenarios.  The active optics system is now fully operational, with the Shack–Hartmann sensor usually being able to reduce aberration by a significant amount in just two iterations.
