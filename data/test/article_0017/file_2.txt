Since sub-millimeter array technology allows for complex source imaging using groups from seven to eight telescopes, we know that existing tools like PIONIER and GRAVITY are capable even though they currently only utilize four at a time on our very own Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The VLTI has been designed for this purpose but its current setup limits its potential due to limitations in combining multiple telescope observations at once as well as its spatial frequency capabilities which impact what information it captures about objects in space when observing them through different angles or distances from each other on Earth's surface . To overcome these challenges we should first maximize how much we use our existing equipment before embarking on further expansions such as adding additional telescope units or extending our baselines which will require significant upgrades but have huge benefits when used properly .
One way we could achieve this would be by increasing both spatial frequency coverage through longer delays lines or even doubling their optical path lengths using clever design strategies like folding beams twice within them . This will allow us access to data previously unavailable while also allowing us greater flexibility in selecting specific combinations for observation purposes .
