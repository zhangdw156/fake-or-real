Dinosaur Rex was an enormous theropod dinosaur from about 77 million years ago during what we call "the Late Cretaceous". They were carnivorous dinosaurs known for their large size relative to other theropod dinosaurs like Velociraptors or Deinonychuses .
Dinosaurs are extinct - so you won't find any alive today!
But paleontologists have found fossilized remains which help us understand how these amazing creatures lived millions upon millions years ago!
