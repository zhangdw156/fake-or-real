To measure redshifts accurately using photometry data from galaxies requires a large field of view - at least one thousand square degrees - while measuring galaxy properties like their brightness or emission lines needs even larger areas exceeding six thousand square degrees due to potential limitations caused by noise at low densities .
To ensure reliable data collection across different types of galaxies:
They need specific density thresholds per type (bright galaxies), luminous red galaxies), emission line galaxies), and quasars). These thresholds prevent random fluctuations in observations from interfering with accurate measurement results
A high spectroscopic success rate must be met across different galaxy categories: greater than ninety five percent accuracy for bright galaxies; greater than seventy five percent accuracy for luminous red galaxies; greater than eighty percent accuracy for emission line galaxies; greater than fifty percent accuracy for quasars
Finally , given existing high quality imaging data available through projects like DESI KiDS , it's important that they cover as much sky space as possible so they can obtain meaningful results about redshift distributions within this region . This ensures quality data collection across these regions while maximizing statistical power when conducting such analysis .
