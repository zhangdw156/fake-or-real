VANDELS aims to investigate how gases escape from young stars (outflowing gas). This study is crucial because these powerful flows might play a significant role in stopping new stars from forming and shaping how metals are distributed within galaxies at very early stages after their birth (high redshift). To accomplish this:
VANDELS will use its extremely sensitive instruments to precisely measure how fast these gases are leaving galaxies across different sizes types; it's important because we want to understand how they affect new stars being born as well as their overall evolution over time;
By comparing these flows between galaxies that have active supermassive black holes (AGNs) versus those without them we can better understand what drives both galaxy evolution AND why many newly formed stars eventually fade into older celestial objects like red giants or white dwarfs .
Essentially this program seeks answers about how much gas escapes from young stars relative their own creation rate what factors drive this process - ultimately affecting our understanding about galaxy evolution over cosmic time scales..
