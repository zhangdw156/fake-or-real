The Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) is a high-performance instrument designed to study stars and galaxies at different wavelengths. MUSE consists of 24 individual components, each with its own specialized functions like slicing light, collecting it, and detecting changes in color caused by the objects being observed. The instruments uses multiple small lenses to split the light from the target into separate points allowing them to see faint details.  It's currently undergoing final checks in Europe before deployment.
