The European Southern Observatory (ESA) is teaming up with a group called "the China-based consortium" (the name isn't specified) for a special workshop focused on preparing everyone in their communities for a new large-scale astronomical survey project called 'Four Multisite Mapping Project', or "4MSChina" as it's known as short form Chinese translation). This event takes place at an address in China from May sixth through eighth of this year (2019). It aims at sharing knowledge about how they plan their observations with other researchers across different parts of their organization so that they can all participate effectively once it begins operating online sometime after that date . Anyone who wants more info should check out their official website or contact them directly via email since there's no other way listed here yet.)
