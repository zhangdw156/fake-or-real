The European Southern Observatory (ESO) is hosting a workshop with partners in May called "Preparing for 4 MOST." This event aims at sharing knowledge from a collaboration called "The Four Most" (or "Four MOST") consortium with members of ESO's research community so they can become familiar with it before submitting proposals related it during an upcoming call for proposals that may include using some of its capabilities . This could help researchers better understand how they can contribute effectively via their own projects while also encouraging collaboration between those within both communities . More details about Four MOST's plans including upcoming public surveys are available on their website or you can reach out directly through various channels including ESOs User Support Department or their dedicated helpdesk located on their website .
