**Let’s expand the possibilities for space exploration – and our furry (or scaly) friends!**

We're building LTCS with an eye on the future of astronomy.  This means not only the launch of AOF, but also handling numerous telescopes. Think about it: we can easily add or take away instruments from our observatory, and adjust how sensitive our lasers are. That flexibility is key for exploring space!

**Our upgrades will revolutionize data collection:**
* **A New LTCS**:  An update coming in April of next year will automatically reload configurations (like prioritizing observations) and laser constellations. This means less time fiddling, more data! 
* **Laser Collision Prevention**: We're talking about smooth sailing through space with better collision calculations for all possible telescope setups, especially those using ERIS on UT4, which can pick one of four available lasers!  
* **Fully Integrated Technology:** The latest VLT software update (with 64-bit support) will seamlessly integrate third-party tools into LTCS – a seamless upgrade to our entire VLTSW system.
* **New Possibilities**: Both the OT and vOT are being upgraded to support even more lasers on site! This means UT4 could not only be a laser propagator, but also a laser-impacted telescope.  Just like we realized in Paranal, some minor tweaks will make everything work smoothly. 

**A new era of space exploration awaits:**
* **ERIS Considerations**: The unique setup for ERIS might require further discussion as it could present some challenges. Let's discuss the possibilities! 
* **PARLA Support**: Our observing tools already do an amazing job with laser collision detection (using PARLA). This gives users a great trial period to familiarize themselves with these new workflows.  Feedback will help us refine the experience.

**Keep exploring, keep innovating:**  LTCS is getting a much-needed overhaul – with updates coming soon before MLGSF operations begin. Let’s explore the unknown and reach new frontiers!
