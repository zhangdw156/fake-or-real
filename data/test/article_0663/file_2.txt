Studying the distribution of metals within galaxies across different periods in history helps us understand their evolution and how they interact with surrounding space.  The presence and behavior of metals inside a galaxy provides valuable information about the gas exchange processes between galaxies and their immediate environment. For a long time, only global measurements were available for galaxies at high redshift (z). The SINFONI instrument allowed scientists to study metal distribution at the individual level in high-redshift galaxies, becoming a major focus of the MASSIV survey. So far, they have measured the flux ratio between [N ii] 6584 Å and Hα emission lines in concentric regions within 26 MASSIV galaxies. These regions are centered on the brightest Hα emission, which is often associated with the galaxy's center based on its movement and structure.  The size of the annular region was carefully chosen to capture enough signal for reliable measurements of the faint [N ii] 6584 Å line. This method allowed scientists to understand how metallicity changes in radial direction within each galaxy and quantify this gradient. The results from the 26 MASSIV galaxies are illustrated in Figure 5, showing their metallicity gradients, which is important because we see that some have a positive metallicity gradient where the amount of metal increases as you move outward from the center of the galaxy. This finding is surprising since it's rare in nearby galaxies. The majority of these seven galaxies (5 out of 7) were found to be interacting or merging systems.  This suggests that interactions may be the main reason for metals flowing into the center, particularly when comparing them to other nearby galaxies. Another explanation for this result is cold accretion but this is not as commonly accepted at higher redshift and has less support at z = 1.2 and even less at z < 2.  In conclusion, all the results from the MASSIV survey so far suggest a scenario where galaxy assembly progresses from smooth cold gas accretion to merging interactions as time goes on, with a transition likely happening around a redshift of 1-1.5.
