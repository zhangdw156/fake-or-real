The Adaptive Optics Facility at MUSE will be used primarily in wide-field mode starting in mid-2017. Other modes, like narrow-field mode and the ground layer adaptive optics of HAWK-I, will follow in 2018. Using an adaptive secondary mirror will provide turbulence-corrected images for all instruments at Unit 4 without additional equipment. The instrument park benefits from this upgrade as it allows more effective use of the capabilities of the adaptive secondary mirror. In 2020, a new instrument (ERIS) with enhanced resolution and sensitivity in near infrared will be added. This instrument combines SINFONI's integral field unit and a diffraction-limited camera sensitive up to 5 μm. All instruments at Unit 4 can use natural guide stars or up to four laser guide stars for wavefront sensing.  In MUSE's wide-field mode, the adaptive optics module GALACSI will broaden and sharpen images across the field of view, offering better viewing conditions. In MUSE’s narrow-field mode, Strehl conditions exceeding 5% in the visible (650 nm) are achievable, facilitating observations for crowded integral field spectroscopy fields like galaxies' centers or globular clusters. The HAWK-I instrument with GRAAL will provide a two-fold improvement in images of the J-, H-, and K-bands (< 0.4 arcseconds), improving image quality regardless of seeing conditions. This is expected to deliver nearly space-based observatory quality images in near infrared.
