By examining the molecular cloud as a whole, researchers can understand the number and location of young stellar objects (YSOs) to determine its efficiency in star formation and discover preferred modes of star formation. The identified YSO candidates near areas of high extinction in Orion B were found close to sites associated with the young stellar clusters NGC 2068 and NGC 2071, which confirm these regions as active areas of star formation. A concentrated grouping of class I and flat spectrum sources was found at the peak of extinction near the Herbig–Haro objects (HH 24-26 group), indicating a highly active star formation region.  

To further analyze the clustering structures, researchers investigated the density of YSOs in these regions. They determined that the volume density for all locations of star formation is approximately 10 million stellar units per cubic parsec cubed (MA pc–3). Based on this analysis and their specific criteria for classifying star-forming sites from Spitzer Legacy Survey data, they classify the clusters NGC 2068 and NGC 2071 as star clusters and HH 24-26 as a stellar group.  Moreover, over half of the YSO candidates are found in these two regions, suggesting most of the star formation in this part of Orion B occurs within clusters.

Finally, researchers examined how efficiently Orion B transforms molecular gas into stars. While many might think that more massive clouds are inherently more active in star formation, other studies have indicated it's about a cloud's mass distribution above a specific gas surface density threshold. 
 
To investigate this, the researchers used their extinction map and estimated the overall molecular cloud mass, and the gas surface density in Orion B as well as its substructures (clusters and groups) assuming a distance of 400 pc.  This was achieved using a near-infrared photometry technique that employed the color excess method for generating the extinction map. The measured extinction is then converted to gas column density and mass surface density through a known relationship.  Star formation efficiency (SFE) for each cluster is determined based on the gas mass associated with each and their corresponding stellar masses, thus SFE = Mstars/ (Mstars + Mcloud).  Results are presented in Table 1. The study showed that NGC 2071 and HH 24-26 appear active star formation sites, while NGC 2068 appears to be in a more evolved state. Overall, the SFE averaged around 4%, a value generally consistent with those measured for Orion A and B as well as other regions of star formation in the Galaxy.
