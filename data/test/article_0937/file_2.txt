The full involvement of the entire European astronomy community is crucial for ensuring the quality and credibility of the Science Vision and the Infrastructure Roadmap. Several panels will be created: one based on scientific themes and the other on observational methods. These panels will produce draft reports to be reviewed and refined through community-wide meetings. The meetings are planned for December 2006 for the Science Vision and for March 2008 for the Infrastructure Roadmap. Efforts will be made to prevent unnecessary overlaps by maintaining close communication with other related efforts. With full participation from ESA, a key goal is to improve coordination between plans for ground and space-based astronomy. For more details on the progress, goals, and objectives of ASTRONET, please visit our website at http://www.astronet-eu.org. ASTRONET will succeed if it helps unite all funding agencies toward building the significant new research infrastructures that European astronomy needs to stay competitive and promote effective collaborations among various European astronomy communities. The enthusiastic participation of the community is vital to achieving this aim.
