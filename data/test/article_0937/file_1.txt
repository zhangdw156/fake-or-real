The full involvement of the European astronomical community is crucial for ensuring the quality and credibility of the outcomes, particularly the Science Vision and the Infrastructure Roadmap. Several panels are being formed: one organized by scientific themes and another by observational techniques. These panels will create draft reports, which will be revised and validated through dedicated meetings involving the entire community. These meetings are scheduled for December 2006 for the Science Vision and March 2008 for the Infrastructure Roadmap. Special care will be taken to prevent unnecessary duplication, such as maintaining close contact with other relevant initiatives. With ESA fully involved, a key goal is to enhance coordination between ground-based and space-based astronomy plans. For more information about ASTRONET's status, goals, and objectives, visit our website at http://www.astronet-eu.org. ASTRONET will succeed if it fosters cooperation among all funding agencies to develop the large and costly research infrastructures necessary for the future of European astronomy, as well as to establish genuine collaborations among all European astronomical communities. The community's enthusiastic participation in this effort will be vital to achieving this goal.
