XClass is software tool that helps astronomers analyze astronomical data using parallel processing techniques called Message Passing Interface (MPI).
It offers advanced features like fitting physical parameters across multiple molecular lines within datasets; this helps identify individual chemical elements present in space along with their properties like temperature and density distribution within those elements' regions within their host objects .
Unlike other similar programs that may only consider some lines at once , XClass accounts fully for every line from each element at specific wavelengths . This makes it more reliable when identifying different chemical compounds present simultaneously .
To achieve this analysis , it uses simplified equations based on local thermodynamic equilibrium(LTE), assuming uniform temperatures throughout its analysis area . Although this assumption works well most times , it may not apply perfectly when dealing with non-equilibrium processes involving collisions between atoms or molecules that arent accounted properly .
The software utilizes precompiled databases containing spectral information about various molecular species obtained through various scientific research projects including NASAs JPL project team Cologne Database For Molecular Spectroscopy project team.. These databases allow users to input specific details about their target spectra including sizes , temperatures , densities etc., allowing them detailed control over how they want their spectra analyzed
Finally , users can utilize specialized syntax known as Splatalogue format specifically designed to work seamlessly alongside CASA's existing tools making integrating these two powerful systems even easier than before!
