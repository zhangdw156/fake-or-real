There are at least three significant benefits to conducting Cepheid distance measurements in near-infrared bands. First, it greatly reduces the impact of dust absorption. Second, the light curves of Cepheids in the near-infrared, especially in the K-band, are more symmetrical and have smaller amplitudes compared to their optical counterparts. This allows for precise measurements of a Cepheid's average K-band brightness from just one random phase observation, provided the optical light curve and period are known. As a result, K-band period-luminosity (PL) relations can be established cost-effectively if Cepheids in a galaxy have already been identified and characterized in the optical range. Additionally, theoretical studies indicate that the PL relation in the near-infrared is even less affected by metallicity than in optical wavelengths. Consequently, we have been conducting near-infrared follow-up imaging for selected samples of long-period Cepheids in most of the galaxies in our project. These images are being captured using the VLT/ISAAC and NTT with the SOFI instrument. We have achieved excellent results from this high-quality data, as recently shown for NGC 300. Figure 5 displays the J- and K-band PL relations obtained from our VLT images for this galaxy, which have allowed for an accurate distance measurement to NGC 300 by combining near-infrared and optical data. The work on NGC 300 has demonstrated the importance of infrared images in determining the galaxy's reddening, including the dust absorption effects within the galaxy. This approach is essential for achieving the Araucaria Project's ultimate goal of measuring distances to nearby galaxies with at least 5 percent precision or better.
