About six months after acquiring the initial images, we can make some general observations about image reconstruction at the VLTI: The results published so far show that this ESO facility can produce images with a spatial resolution of a few milliarcseconds, but only for bright targets. This level of spatial resolution cannot be achieved by traditional single telescopes, even with advancements like the ELT. So far, only relatively simple objects have been imaged, such as binary systems, simple environments around stars, or images with a limited field-of-view. Most of the main findings have come from Visitor Mode using at least three different telescope setups over typically three observing nights. While the VLTI has been criticized for being slow, a sampling speed of about 25 minutes for each calibrated point appears adequate. However, the poor quality of the calibrated visibilities is a significant drawback. Additionally, all current datasets have a poorly populated uv-plane, particularly in the Northâ€“South direction. These two issues represent the majority of complaints from VLTI users and should be addressed by the Science Operations team moving forward. There are also several ongoing imaging projects targeting B[e] stars, young stellar objects, and supergiants. The researchers generally agree that the reconstructed images validate the basic characteristics of the targets independently for the first time. However, at this stage, the images do not offer a more detailed view than parametric models. Overcoming this challenge will require increasing both the quantity and quality of visibility measurements, as previously noted. Nonetheless, models will still be necessary to provide quantitative constraints and consistently test the physics behind the images. It is relatively straightforward to place the VLTI within the current international framework. The VLTI does not yet have the best imaging capabilities; the MIRC instrument at the CHARA array combines four telescopes and is being upgraded to six. Furthermore, the VLTI's dynamic range is not yet the best; the FLUOR instrument at CHARA, while only combining two telescopes, achieves precision below 1%. When it comes to limiting magnitude, Keck-I and the VLTI with the UTs perform similarly. However, the VLTI offers unique spectral coverage from 1 to 10 microns and a remarkable spectral resolution of up to R = 12,000. It also features the unique capability of relocatable telescopes, allowing both compact and large interferometric arrays to be set up within a few days. Finally, it is the only interferometer that provides real Service Mode scheduling and a high level of user support, leading to numerous refereed publications.
