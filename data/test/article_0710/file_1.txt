Due to the pixelation and binary transmission of pixels, high frequency components develop in the power spectrum of a microdot filter. Smaller dots lead to higher spatial frequencies for light scattering. Using smaller pixels improves the match between the desired transmission and the actual transmission, relating to a sampling problem. Higher sampling rates (more binary dots used for representing varying transmission) yield better results. For coronagraphs, theoretical analysis regarding the effect of dot size on science images for pupil apodiser-type components has been developed and confirmed experimentally, including for focal plane masks. Dots should generally be sized larger than the wavelength of the operating light; otherwise, predicting their effect on the field becomes challenging, and the transmission could vary significantly with the wavelength. Typical pixel sizes for astronomy usually range from a few tens of microns to a few microns. Coronagraphs designed for pupil plane apodization don’t need a high opacity. However, opacity of the metal layer (which varies with wavelength) is crucial for focal plane masks, whether they use microdot filters or different technologies. Focal plane mask coronagraphs require high optical density, typically exceeding 6 (transmission < 10–6), to prevent star light from contaminating the detector.
