Due to the pixelation and binary transmission of pixels, high frequency components appear in the power spectrum of a microdot filter. Smaller dots lead to higher spatial frequencies for light scattering. Using smaller pixels improves the match between the desired and actual transmission. This situation is similar to a sampling problem, where better results come from increasing the sampling rate (i.e., using more binary dots to represent the continually changing transmission). For coronagraphs, theoretical calculations about how dot size affects the science image for pupil apodiser components have been developed and experimentally verified, as well as for focal plane masks. Generally, dots should not be close in size to the wavelength of the light they are meant to work with, as this makes predictions about how the field will respond to these filters difficult, and the transmission can vary significantly with wavelength. Typical pixel sizes for astronomical uses range from a few tens to a few microns. Coronagraphs made for pupil plane apodisation do not need high opacity. However, for focal plane masks, the opacity of the metal layer (optical density, which varies with wavelength) is crucial, requiring a high optical density specification for focal plane mask coronagraphs, specifically more than optical density 6 (transmission less than 10⁻⁶) to prevent starlight from reaching the detector.
