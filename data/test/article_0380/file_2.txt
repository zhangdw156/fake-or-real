The camera, made up of 112 CCDs (charge-coupled devices), has a grid structure where each finger holds 28 individual CCDs arranged in four rows. This arrangement covers approximately 4.6 by 3.6 degrees of the sky, and it is subdivided into fingers A through D based on their column position. Each CCD contains 600 by 2400 pixels, measuring 13 by 13 micrometers, with a pixel scale that translates to 0.882 arcseconds per pixel. There are gaps between these fingers of 0.43 degrees, requiring two exposures offset by 0.5 degrees in right ascension (RA) for complete coverage of the field of view.  However, only one pair of exposures fully covers the desired area except for a specific field where two pairs are required. Around 16% of the detector is not functional due to certain CCD problems like permanent off states or random activations. Despite these issues, the working parts cover approximately 7.5 square degrees of sky. The QUESTâ€“La Silla survey uses an infrared Q-band filter ranging from 4000 to 7000 Angstroms, designed to avoid fringing often seen in images obtained with redder filters used in earlier surveys like Palomar-QUEST. This Q-band system response is comparable to a broad SDSS (g + r) filter.
