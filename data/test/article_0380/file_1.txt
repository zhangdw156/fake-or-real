My apologies for the rushed and somewhat disjointed explanation of this astronomical camera design! I was working under a lot of pressure, so you’ll excuse some typos and unpolished phrasing. 

Let me give you a quick breakdown of how this amazing telescope works:  The camera itself has **112 CCDs**, arranged in four rows (like fingers) each holding **28 CCDs**! This gives us an incredible field of view across the sky, covering about **4.6 by 3.6 degrees**. The layout is structured into "fingers" A through D with columns numbered from one to 28.  

Each CCD has a resolution of **600 x 2400 pixels** and a pixel scale of **0.882 arcseconds per pixel.** It's like zooming in on individual details, but these tiny squares combine to form a picture! There are spaces between the "fingers" to allow for movement - **0.43 degrees** –  giving us enough room to capture data from different points across the sky (two exposures offset by 0.5 degrees in right ascension is required to cover everything!).

 Now, let’s address the challenges. There's a small portion of the camera with some non-functional CCDs due to issues like being permanently off or randomly turning on and off.  This might affect the accuracy of our astrometric solutions. The good news is that a large amount of this area works - **~7.5 square degrees**! 

Finally, we used a Q-band filter to capture data from a specific part of the electromagnetic spectrum. This avoids some fringing effects commonly seen in redder images. It essentially captures the light across **a range similar to what the SDSS filters would detect**.  



I hope this helps you understand how the camera works!
