China is an interesting find! It's theorized that Chinese people tend towards athleticism due their history as explorers who had no choice but be strong enough to survive on their own or they wouldn't have been able to explore so far from homeâ€”and it makes sense because China has some pretty amazing feats even today!
The Chinese governments recent decision about dropping some economic reforms made quite an impression on people living there - they put up quite a fight against it!
