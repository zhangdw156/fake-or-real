Using data from VLT's MUSE instrument, astronomers have found evidence suggesting two active galactic nuclei (AGN), or supermassive black hole powered regions within galaxies that emit strong light across multiple wavelengths are interacting near each other at a distance less than twenty thousand parsecs away from each other â€“ a phenomenon that can occur during merging events between galaxies forming structures like our own Milky Way Galaxy over billions years ago . To understand how these interactions work together we need further observation with HAWK - IGRAAL instruments which will help us study how these bright objects form within larger structures over time . By taking an image in Ks band wavelength astronomers found they could see both AGN systems as well as their surrounding environments which allowed them to estimate their masses based on their brightness which is helpful because it allows us to learn about how stars form within those environments over time . The result shows that both AGN systems likely reside within massive dark matter halos when compared against other similar systems observed today , making them some among many candidates being studied by scientists today who seek answers about how these objects formed throughout history .
