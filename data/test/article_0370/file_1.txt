KASHz's goal is to understand how common ionized gas emissions are coming from galaxies of high-redshift Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). To do this, they looked at broad and asymmetric emission-line profiles, as these are indicators of outflows driven by warm material. By comparing the velocity widths of observed [O III] emission lines in AGN to the distribution of speeds, the team found that half of the galaxies show velocities exceeding 600 km/s, which is highly unusual from normal galaxy dynamics alone. These findings suggest a high prevalence of ionized outflows driven by warm material.  Their study compared this with a similar sample of low-redshift AGN to see if these trends continued at high redshifts. They found that the distributions of ionised gas velocities closely matched both samples, indicating consistent behaviors across different times and black hole evolution rates.
