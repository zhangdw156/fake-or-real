Even though MUSE has many opto-mechanical parts, it will be user-friendly. The 24 modules have no moving parts, and switching between wide and narrow-field modes only requires adding some optics. MUSE operates in three modes: non-AO wide-field, AO wide-field, and AO narrow-field. These modes only differ in the presence of AO and how spatial sampling is done. In the non-AO wide-field mode, users will use a simple point-and-shoot method. The other modes involve more complexity due to AO operations, including lasers. All modes have the same spectroscopic settings for wavelength range and resolution. However, processing the data is challenging because each exposure is 1.6 Gb, and the data has 3D characteristics. Managing such large data cubes is complicated. For example, combining multiple cubes from AO observations under varying atmospheric conditions is a 4-dimensional problem because the point spread function from AO changes based on time, location in the field of view, and wavelength.
