Although MUSE has a many opto-mechanical parts, it is simple to use. The 24 modules have no moving parts, and switching between wide and narrow-field modes just requires adding some optics. MUSE operates in three modes: non-AO wide-field, AO wide-field, and AO narrow-field. These modes only differ in the presence of AO and how they sample spatial data. In the non-AO wide-field mode, use is limited to a basic point-and-shoot function. In the other two modes, the complexity arises from running the AO, including lasers. All operating modes have the same spectral settings (wavelength range and resolution). However, handling the 1.6 Gb of data from a single exposure is problematic due to its sizable volume and 3D nature. The management of such large data cubes can be difficult. For example, optimally merging data cubes obtained with AO under varying atmospheric conditions presents a challenge because it involves tracking four dimensions: time, position in the field of view, wavelength, and changes to the AO-generated point spread function.
