The TIMER project's large data set enables scientists to study a variety of astrophysical phenomena like how stars form within spiral arms (primary bars) or within barred spiral galaxies themselves (the "star formation desert"). This data also helps researchers understand connections between different structures like "boxpeanuts" formations around galactic centers ("barlenses"), how stars move within disks around a galaxy's center ("stellar migration"), where nuclear rings located relative to certain points on galactic disks ("inner Lindblad resonance"), and even complex interactions like gas flow along these structures ("gas shear" "shocks").
Moreover by combining data from telescopes like MUSE (Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) alongside advanced instruments like ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array), researchers aim for deeper understanding about how new stars form through studying nearby galaxy interactions involving both molecular clouds young stars while examining this process over time using high-resolution imaging techniques . This combined approach allows scientists to better comprehend complex processes happening inside interstellar medium phases related directly or indirectly linked through mechanisms such as AGN feedback influencing both ionized molecular outflows across space time scales .
