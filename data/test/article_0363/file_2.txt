Figures 3â€“5 show high-quality spectra that allow accurate measurements of many physical parameters in distant galaxies.  These parameters can be broadly categorized into stellar populations and kinematics. Stellar population measurements include average star age and metallicity, providing a broader picture of star formation history. LEGA-C has overcome the challenge of observing distant galaxies, giving us an advantage over current studies for reconstructing complete star formation histories. Most stars in these galaxies are younger than 3 billion years old, allowing researchers to resolve different generations of stars. This information allows scientists to infer the masses of progenitor stars at a redshift greater than 1.  We can now track individual galaxies across significant periods of cosmic time, observing when star formation was most active in the average universe. Kinematic measurements include stellar velocity dispersion, which helps study gravitational potential and total mass based on collision-less star particles. Testing whether the previously used stellar mass estimates are reliable at long distances is now a possibility with these direct measurements. These velocities along with central mass density can explain changes in star formation activity in distant galaxies. Finally, by combining kinematic measurements of both stars and gas velocities, scientists can test for the reliability of existing estimates and compare results to previous work on mass estimations. While obtaining integrated spectral properties is the primary goal, detailed spatial information on stellar populations and kinematics has been acquired, providing valuable insights into galaxy formation physics and its connection to dark matter halos.
