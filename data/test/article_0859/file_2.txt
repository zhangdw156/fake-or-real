The best instrument combines imaging and spectroscopy functions. The goal is to integrate the best features of both: for imaging, it should offer a wide field of view and high spatial resolution, and for spectroscopy, it needs high resolving power and an extensive spectral range. This combined instrument tackles limitations present in traditional methods since it eliminates the need to pre-select sources, allowing for detection of objects that documented pre-imaging might have overlooked. Particularly in cases where objects are very faint but have bright emission lines, this instrument is essential, as traditional imaging methods would fail to identify them. A simple calculation indicates that this ideal instrument would require numerous detector pixels; for instance, a spatial field of view expected from a basic 2048 × 4096 pixel detector complicates this further with a wavelength range of 0.4–0.8 µm and restores 4000 spectral pixels, totaling approximately 16 billion pixels. The necessity for additional optics in front of these pixels highlights the feasibility challenges involved.
