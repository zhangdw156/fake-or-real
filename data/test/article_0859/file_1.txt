The best instrument would be one that can do both imaging and spectroscopy at the same time. It should combine the advantages of both: for imaging, this means a wide field of view and high resolution; for spectroscopy, it means high resolving power and a wide range of wavelengths. This kind of instrument would address the challenges of traditional methods. It allows for detecting sources without needing to select them in advance, even identifying objects that would have been missed in earlier imaging. In cases where objects are very faint but have bright emission lines, this instrument would be necessary since direct imaging wouldn’t work. A basic calculation shows that such an ideal instrument would require a lot of pixels on its detector. For instance, using a 2048 × 4096 pixel detector over a wavelength range of 0.4–0.8 µm with a spectral resolution of 3000 results in 4000 spectral pixels. This totals to 16 billion pixels. Adding optics in front of the pixels reveals the challenges in making this instrument practical.
