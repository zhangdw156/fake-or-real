The template matching process for individual stellar spectra and the comprehensive sky model fits show good success.  These results are strong enough that further studies of the remaining residuals, which include absorption lines from interstellar material, can be conducted. This type of analysis is not possible with just a typical isolated spectrum. These results offer unique insights into small-scale structures in the interstellar medium (ISM) that could not be captured or spatially resolved using individual spectra alone. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, approximately 300 residual spectra were averaged to create several composite spectra of similar quality. The accuracy of the stellar and telluric fits is very high. An inset displays both doublet lines of the weak interstellar potassium I line. While the potassium I 7664 angstroms line sits directly on a strong telluric band, the potassium I 7699 angstroms line is unaffected by skylines. The independently fitted ratio remains stable, and this confidence in the applied method provides an important indicator. In fact, this ratio can be used as a diagnostic tool to determine optical thickness.  Since we know we can successfully remove stellar features and sky lines, systematic analysis of other weak ISM features was continued. For instance, we observed many diffuse interstellar bands across the broad wavelength range observed by the MUSE spectrograph. This research will be further explored in a third follow-up paper on these observations (Wendt et al.). Other stronger ISM lines had to be considered during the template matching process. A particular challenge is the sodium D doublet. We expect at least three unresolved contributors: stellar sodium D, atmospheric sodium D, and interstellar sodium D along the line of sight. The stellar component and Earth's atmosphere are subtracted; analysis of the remaining (interstellar) contribution across 31 Voronoi tessellated bins (spaxel spectra co-added to increase signal-to-noise ratio) is undertaken. The color map shows the measured total equivalent width of the sodium D doublet for each composite spectrum per bin, with an average equivalent width around 960 milliangstroms, and the pointings in black dashed lines. The red star indicates the center of the globular cluster. This mapping reveals compelling small-scale structures in interstellar sodium D that are not correlated with the points of observation, nor the number of stars per bin (independent of the cluster). The linear projection for typical scale sizes at a distance of 100 parsecs from the edge of the Local Bubble is approximately a milliparsec. This exemplifies how MUSE is uniquely equipped to provide an overview of the small-scale structures within the ISM.
