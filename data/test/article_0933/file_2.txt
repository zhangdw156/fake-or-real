The ALMA correlator offers a wide range of observing modes categorized into two main types: Time Division Mode (TDM) and Frequency Division Mode (FDM). In TDM, there are 32 processor planes, each examining 1-millisecond segments of digital signals at 125 MHz, functioning like a standard XF system. For FDM, each sub-band within the 2 GHz input baseband is handled by various planes, or if fewer sub-bands are used, all planes work together for better spectral detail. The TFB filter boards are designed for both TDM and FDM, directing data to the final processing stage of TFB boards in TDM mode. Examples of spectral resolutions obtained in FDM, particular to processing one baseband per quadrant, are outlined for several input bandwidths. The correlator normally uses Nyquist sampling, but double Nyquist sampling quickens correlation efficiency, albeit with lesser power and resolution. The best possible resolution is 3.8 kHz, facilitating in-depth spectral analysis, but processing two basebands per quadrant results in poorer resolutions. Full analysis of Stokes parameters further reduces this quality. While 4-bit correlation is an option that increases efficiency at the cost of fourfold diminished frequency resolution, double Nyquist can work with it, speeding data output at the same lower resolution. There are about 70 available modes overall, although only a few align specficically with TDM. TDM is better suited for needing rapid data output (minimum 16 ms) and medium resolutions (31.25, 15.6 or 7.8 kHz) over 2 GHz. The 64-antenna correlator can reorganize sub-bands in the baseband and separate quadrants into individualized units. This allows for various applications, such as (a) high resolution in a targeted spectral area from 2 GHz to 62.5 MHz (or 31.25 MHz) with 62.5 MHz sub-bands adjusted within the spread; (b) multiple, separated spectral regions sharing the same resolution, sensitivity, and polarization methods within the 2 GHz framework; (c) offering different spectral resolutions to focus analysis more intensely on certain features. All quadrants operate independently, allowing the simultaneous use of these different methods, even interchangeably.
