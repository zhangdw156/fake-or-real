The ALMA baseline correlator can operate in various observing modes categorized into two main types: Time Division Modes (TDM) and Frequency Division Modes (FDM). In TDM mode, there are 32 correlator units, each handling one-millisecond time slices of the input signal at a frequency of 125 MHz, functioning as a pure XF system. In FDM mode, each of the 32 segments of the 2 GHz input signal is processed by one correlator unit, or fewer segments may be processed by all units to achieve better spectral resolution. The TFB filter boards support both modes, with data sent directly to the final stage on each board during TDM operation. Examples of spectral resolution in FDM modes, using one baseband per quadrant, are provided for various input bandwidths. The correlator primarily uses Nyquist sampling, but double Nyquist sampling is also available to enhance correlation efficiency, though this reduces the resources and spectral resolution. The highest resolution possible is 3.8 kHz, allowing for detailed spectral studies. If two basebands are processed per quadrant, the resolution is halved, and this degradation amounts to another factor of two for full Stokes parameter analysis. Additionally, 4-bit correlation is supported to improve correlation efficiency, but it results in four times poorer frequency resolution. Double Nyquist sampling can also be used with 4-bit correlation, speeding up data transmission without significantly improving efficiency. There are about 70 different observing modes, with only a few in TDM. TDM is better for quick data dumps (minimum 16 ms) and moderate resolution (31.25, 15.6, or 7.8 kHz) across 2 GHz. The 64-antenna correlator can move spectral segments within the input signal and divide one quadrant into separate sub-units, enabling multiple configurations: (a) high resolution in a specific spectral area from 2 GHz to 62.5 MHz (or 31.25 MHz) with tunable 62.5 MHz segments; (b) multiple distinct spectral regions within 2 GHz but maintaining the same resolution, sensitivity, and polarization options; (c) varying spectral resolution across different bandwidths to focus on specific features. All quadrants operate independently, allowing for simultaneous use of these modes with overlapping quadrants.
