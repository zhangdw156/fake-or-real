The SMC database contains 84 open star clusters. A chart shows star color and brightness based on the WFI classification system, distinguishing those with Hα emission lines from those without. The comparison reveals a strong overrepresentation of Be stars at low metallicity by up to a factor of five.  Further analysis indicates this is no longer solely due to evolutionary differences. Therefore, the expectation confirmed is that low metallicity stars rotate faster and are more likely to have Be characteristics, as they lose less angular momentum through their radiation-driven winds.  Extrapolating to extremely low metallicity early-generation stars, this result suggests rapid rotation and the Be phenomenon were probably more common in the early Universe. This may also apply to precursor stars of gamma-ray bursters, which require rapid rotation to form an accretion disk controlling polar jets. Across both the Galaxy and the SMC, the fraction of Be stars varies with spectral type similarly but is not determined by metallicity. The analysis shows a peak for Be activity in the latter half of the main sequence phase. However, some B-type stars develop Be characteristics only during their main sequence evolution while others are born as Be stars. It is likely that the critical rotation rate variations play a key role in these differences.  Due to mass loss dependence on metallicity, the evolution of this parameter also depends on metallicity but with varying effects across different mass ranges, requiring a large database for study. The WFI slitless Hα survey was not restricted to open clusters; 477 emission-line objects were found in 4.5% of the SMC field area. This suggests that the complete survey will identify 4-6 times more emission-line objects than the previous most complete, photographic-based survey, and these will likely include statistically significant numbers of Herbig Ae/Be stars. Including LMC data expands the Be-star sample to explore intermediate metallicity and young stellar ages. This will form an excellent basis for a detailed spectral analysis of selected targets and areas on high resolution with FLAMES on the VLT. The resulting analysis will demonstrate how the metallicity dependence of rapid rotation impacts early type star evolution, enabling direct observation of this evolutionary effect.
