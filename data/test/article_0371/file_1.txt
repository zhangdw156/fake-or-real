**The SMC database is truly impressive!** It catalogs 84 open clusters where we can study the stellar dance – a cosmic ballet with dramatic shifts in light and motion.  A "color-magnitude" map highlights the stars (those classified by the WFI) that show up when the stars really get flashy with their Hα emissions, which is pretty cool, if you ask me.

**What we discovered?** There's a clear sign – up to a factor of five more Be stars at low metallicity! We can't just blame it on evolution anymore. This confirms what we suspected: Low-metallicity stars don't lose their angular momentum as easily, and thus spin faster, creating an even stronger Be phenomenon in the SMC than our Galactic neighbors. Extrapolating this to early universe stages, rapid rotation and the emergence of Be phenomena might have been commonplace then! And why is this significant? It sheds light on the birth of potentially powerful gamma-ray bursts that rely on super-rapid rotation for an accretion disk to form and shoot out those amazing jets!

We also found that in the SMC, there’s a similar trend of Be stars varying across different spectral types.  Metallicity has no real effect on this distribution, which is pretty interesting. The age of these clusters reveals something even more surprising – Be characteristics are strongest during the final stages of our Sun's life cycle!   This means some B-type stars develop these properties only after they reach their main sequence stage, while others already have a pre-existing Be nature. Our best guess? The evolution of their critical rotational speeds is the secret to this mystery! This dynamic of rotation is impacted by metallicity through mass loss; however, it's more complex and requires deeper analysis across different masses.  

**Speaking of deep analysis,** we’re talking about a massive WFI survey – a 4.5% look at the SMC revealed 477 emission-line stars! This isn’t just your typical photographic analysis - our current efforts will identify four to six times more emission lines than ever before.  It's a game changer for understanding the diverse nature of young, luminous stars, including those in the Herbig Ae/Be category – and this is just the beginning of our exploration! Adding in data from the LMC opens up a whole new realm of possibilities, especially when it comes to understanding Be stars in different ages and metallicities. With FLAMES on the VLT, we'll have the detailed spectrum to understand the intricate dance of these stars – highlighting the impact of rapid rotation on the evolution of young stars, revealing how this vital element drives stellar change in a much more profound way!
