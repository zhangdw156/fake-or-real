High-precision Fabry-PÃ©rot cavities (FPCs) can selectively filter out specific wavelengths in a spectrum while allowing others to pass. After this initial filtering step, the spectrum undergoes two nonlinear processes: frequency doubling and spectral broadening.  This process must be balanced with a high pulse repetition rate that reduces energy consumption per pulse. A fiber amplifier then boosts the signal's power, increasing the effective range of the subsequent processes. The amplified spectrum experiences limited bandwidth due to absorption and narrowing effects. After a second amplification step, the light is frequency doubled by a harmonic generator (SHG) for further processing. The final spectral broadening occurs through four-wave mixing in a photonic crystal fiber. This process leads to varying intensity distribution resulting in a non-uniform final spectrum. A spatial light modulator (SLM) may be used to even out the spectrum and increase its uniformity with a slight decrease in power. Finally, the light output is coupled through multimode fiber, which reduces sensitivity and interference issues before injection into HARPS calibration fibres, illuminating both the object area and a simultaneous reference point for comparison.
