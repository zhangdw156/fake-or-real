The error diffusion algorithm produces high-quality continuous-tone images and generates noise mainly at high frequencies. Unlike many halftoning methods, it primarily creates high-frequency noise, meaning low and mid-range frequencies in the final output have minimal or no noise due to pixelation and the digital dot output. The error diffusion method is straightforward to explain. The technique sets the pixelâ€™s transmission (either 0% or 100%) by comparing the needed transmission to a 50% threshold. If the transmission needed is below 50%, it sets the output to zero; otherwise, it sets it to one. The resulting transmission error is then spread to adjacent pixels that have not been processed yet by modifying the transmission needed at those locations. This corrects the binary distortion created by converting the continuous tone into binary outputs. This method is used for reproducing gray levels in black and white printing and has applications in shaping laser beams.
