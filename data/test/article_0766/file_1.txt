The error diffusion algorithm produces high-quality continuous tone images and generates noise mainly at high frequencies. Unlike many halftoning methods, it primarily creates high-frequency noise, meaning low and mid-range frequencies in the output have minimal noise due to pixellation and binary dot transmission. The error diffusion process is straightforward. It determines the transmission of a pixel (either 0% or 100%) by comparing it to a 50% threshold. If the required transmission is below 50%, it is set to zero; otherwise, it is set to one. The resulting transmission error is spread to nearby unprocessed pixels by adjusting the transmission needed at those locations. This helps to reduce the binary errors that occur when converting continuous tone requirements into binary values. This method is used for reproducing gray levels in black and white printing and has applications in laser beam shaping.
