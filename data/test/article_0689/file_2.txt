KMOS, a near-infrared spectrograph designed for large scale astronomical research, has achieved a significant milestone. Following its provisional acceptance by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in summer 2012, this instrument is now ready to be integrated with the Very Large Telescope facility on the UT1 at Paranal, Chile.  KMOS was developed by a consortium of international universities and research institutes, including Durham University, Max-Planck Institute for extraterrestrial Physics, Universitäts Sternwarte München, Oxford University, and the UK Astronomy Technology Centre. This unique spectrometer operates across a wavelength range from 0.8–2.45 μm using five gratings, enabling observations in the IZ-, YJ-, H- and K- bands with resolutions between 3000 and 4000. A lower resolution mode enables simultaneous observation of both the Hand K- windows. The instrument can gather spatially resolved information about 24 objects with a single pointing on the sky. It is housed in cryogenic arms within a 7.2 arcminute field at the focal plane of the UT1 Nasmyth focus, relaying 2.8 × 2.8 arcsecond fields to integral field units. The spatial resolution on the sky is 0.2 × 0.2 arcseconds.  KMOS is designed for scientific investigations into galaxy evolution and mass assembly at various redshifts. Before receiving formal acceptance from ESO, extensive testing was performed in an integration lab at the UK Astronomy Technology Centre.  The rigorous ESO Provisional Acceptance Europe process was followed throughout the first six months of this year with ESO staff working with the consortium to verify performance across various aspects, including safety and scientific accuracy. This verification has now successfully concluded. Following successful completion, the instrument has been released for transport to Paranal Observatory. The cable rotator needed to support KMOS electronics is too large for air freight, hence it was shipped by sea before the main equipment. During September and October, the instrument will be reintegrated and tested at the Paranal Assembly, Integration and Test facility, where it will finally be installed on the Nasmyth platform.  The first light of this instrument is planned for late November, followed by commissioning periods to confirm performance in real-world conditions and to integrate KMOS into the overall Paranal Observatory system.   An open call for research proposals using KMOS will be published in March 2013.
