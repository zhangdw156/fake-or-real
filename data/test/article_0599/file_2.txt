The ammonia cell was commissioned by ESO staff as a visiting instrument inside CRIRES during the early part of P82 and has been used for routine work since February 2009. The cell is located within the CRIRES warm optics box, mounted on a movable carriage that moves it to the telescope's beam path. This carriage can accommodate two gas cells at a time, which are usually filled with N2O and CO for calibration purposes, but not for high-precision radial velocity measurements as they do not yield lines in regions of interest. A standard cell is removed to allow for the insertion of our ammonia cell. All observations using this cell have been conducted in visitor mode to avoid interfering with calibrations required for service modes and regular instrument monitoring. 

The gas cells in CRIRES are situated in front of the Nasmyth focus de-rotator, within the converging f/15 beam from the telescope. Their position is then within the path of all spectrograph optics and the instrument’s integrated adaptive optics (AO) system. To make radial velocity measurements, we use the ammonia cell's lines which create absorption on the stellar spectrum. 

The characteristic spectra obtained in our laboratory measurements using a Bruker IFS125 HR Fourier Transform Spectrometer provide needed information for analyzing data during radial velocity measurement. This FTS spectrum has a resolution of R = 620,000 and a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) greater than 700 in the continuum at 2.3 µm. The plot of this spectrum is shown in Figure 3. We obtained the primary FTS measurement with the cell cooled to 13 °C.  The temperature is comparable to that experienced in CRIRES. A second set of measurements were also performed at 24 °C, twice – once before handover to ESO in August 2008 and again after our program started in September 2009. These measurements showed no change in the cell’s spectrum, supporting our assumption of its stability.
