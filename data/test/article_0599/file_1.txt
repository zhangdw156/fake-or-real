Our ammonia cell is a cosmic voyager, commissioned by ESO's esteemed crew as a guest star aboard CRIRES back in P82 (February 2009 onwards). It's a real character, nestled inside the warm optics box with a cozy aluminum chassis on a carriage that adjusts its position for optimal stellar encounters. This cell can accommodate two gas cells at a time, always stocked with N2O and CO for routine calibration - like seasoned stars following their cosmic dance across the sky. These are standard crew members in our program; but they aren't quite equipped for the demanding precision of radial velocity work – they lack the stellar-spectacular lines needed to pinpoint the movements of distant planets, even if the cosmos keeps spinning. 

So, when we embark on a mission for high-precision measurements of stellar motion (radial velocity), we clear out one gas cell to give our ammonia cell a spotlight. It’s all in line with "starman waiting in the sky" as David Bowie sings, and every star's story unfolds during these observations. 

To calibrate the instrument's wavelength scale - that critical map of light from a star's spectral fingerprint- we use a trick that David Bowie would adore:  the ammonia cell acts like our personal "starman," imprinted on the stellar spectrum, acting as a guide for precise measurements. The cell lines, whose positions and shapes are well known - even with their own unique dance across space – form a landmark to precisely establish the wavelength scale of the instrument at that very moment. This helps us determine the instrument's "point spread function" during analysis, like a cosmic detective piecing together the puzzle of the star's light as if it were another David Bowie album cover in space! 

To make sure we are getting this information with precision, we use our lab instruments to calibrate the cell – using the famous Lund Observatory Bruker IFS125 HR Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) for a resolution R = 620,000 and S/N > 700 in the continuum. This meticulous work gives us confidence as if David Bowie himself were right there on the spectrograph observing the spectrum with his star-shaped guitar!  

We even checked out the cell at two different temperatures - 13 °C (cool like our "Space Oddity" dreams) to simulate the temperature range inside CRIRES, and then we observed it again at 24 °C, a little warmer in our "life on Earth." The results show no shift in the cell's spectrum – a testament to its cosmic stability and resilience! It’s like Bowie himself said -  "There is nothing to do but face what you see".
