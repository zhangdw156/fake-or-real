Impact of ALMA on Spanish Extragalactic Astronomy 

To prepare the Spanish extragalactic community for the effects of ALMA science, a meeting was held, including non-radio astronomers, to introduce ALMA's capabilities and discuss collaborations with optical and infrared facilities. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) will be a highly complex and powerful tool for studying the (sub)millimeter range in extragalactic research. A broad approach to its use will be crucial for the project's success, thus the active participation of those outside the radio astronomy field is important. As part of this effort, over 70 Spanish extragalactic astronomers from 13 research centers—who are either already involved or interested in the ALMA project—gathered in Granada with some invited international experts. The scientific organizing committee aimed to include most of the Spanish extragalactic community in ALMA, emphasizing the involvement of non-radio astronomers. The scientific program was designed to leverage the strengths of both the radio and non-radio communities, investigating how ALMA could support research for astronomers less familiar with the project and how collaborations with other wavelengths could aid radio astronomers. A total of 36 presentations were given at the workshop, and eight young researchers showcased their PhD thesis work in relation to ALMA through posters.
