Impact of ALMA on Spanish Extragalactic Astronomy 

To prepare the Spanish extragalactic community for the effects of ALMA science, a meeting was held, including participants from outside radio astronomy, to showcase ALMA's capabilities and identify collaborations with optical and infrared facilities. ALMA, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, will serve as a highly sophisticated and powerful tool for examining the (sub)millimeter range in the extragalactic field. A multi-wavelength strategy will be crucial for the project's success, making the engagement of those outside the radio astronomy field important. As part of this effort, over 70 Spanish extragalactic astronomers from 13 research centers—who are either currently involved with or interested in the ALMA project—gathered in Granada alongside invited international experts. The scientific organizing committee aimed to include a broad portion of the Spanish extragalactic community in ALMA, focusing significantly on non-radio astronomers. The scientific agenda was created to explore the interactions between both communities, examining how ALMA could enhance the work of those less familiar with it and identifying ways for potential integrated research utilizing other wavelengths to support radio astronomers. The workshop featured 36 presentations, and eight young researchers shared posters related to their PhD work in the context of ALMA.
