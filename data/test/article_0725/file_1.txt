The Search for Near-infrared Calibration Sources for E-ELT Instruments  

Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) and their instruments are primarily designed to work in the Near-Infrared (NIR) because adaptive optics performance varies by wavelength. However, there are few established sources for wavelength calibration in this range. This project aims to gather essential data to identify the most suitable calibration sources for NIR instruments at the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), depending on wavelength and spectral resolution. This work supports the Phase A studies of E-ELT instruments, and its findings will be valuable for analyzing NIR science observations in the future. While astronomy and laboratory atomic physics have focused on ultraviolet and visible wavelengths for over a century, there is much less reliable data for elements in the NIR range, making better knowledge of spectral properties crucial for both astronomical spectrum analysis and potential calibration source selection. A comprehensive NIR spectrum database does not currently exist. The European Southern Observatory (ESO) and the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are collaborating to create the necessary fundamental data for selecting optimal calibration sources for E-ELT instruments. Our study involves about 20 different hollow cathode lamps, which we are examining for their spectral and operational properties using a Fourier Transform (FT) spectrometer at ESO. The most promising sources will then undergo further study at atomic physics labs to develop precise wavelength standards and calibration reference data specifically for the E-ELT instruments.
