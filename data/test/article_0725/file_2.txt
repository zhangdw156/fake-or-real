The search for Near-infrared Calibration Sources for E-ELT Instruments  

Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) and their instruments are designed to work best in the Near-Infrared (NIR) due to how adaptive optics perform at different wavelengths. However, there are few established sources for calibration in this wavelength range. This project aims to gather essential data to identify the most suitable calibration sources for NIR instruments at the European ELT (E-ELT) based on wavelength and spectral resolution. The findings will aid the initial studies of E-ELT instruments and will also be useful for future analysis of NIR scientific observations. While astronomy and atomic physics have focused on ultraviolet and visible light for over a century, there is limited reliable atomic data available for NIR wavelengths. Better understanding of spectral properties is needed to analyze astronomical spectra and to select potential calibration sources. Currently, no comprehensive database for NIR spectra exists. The European Southern Observatory (ESO) and the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are collaborating on a project to provide the basic data necessary for selecting the best calibration sources for E-ELT instruments. This study involves about 20 hollow cathode lamps, which are being tested for their spectral and operational characteristics using a Fourier Transform (FT) spectrometer at ESO. The most promising sources will then be examined in atomic physics laboratories to produce accurate wavelength standards and calibration data for E-ELT operations.
