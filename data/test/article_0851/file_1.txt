The ESO Very Large Telescope Interferometer has recently captured its initial images, achieving a spatial resolution of a few milliarcseconds. These images showcase the precise positioning of nearby massive binary stars, the material near the surface of an old variable star, and the dusty environment around an active galactic nucleus. This marks just the beginning, with more results and improvements anticipated in the coming years. The largest stars visible in the sky appear about ten milliarcseconds wide, which is much smaller than the resolving power of top-grade telescopes like the ESO's Unit Telescopes. In the next few decades, Extremely Large Telescopes will offer better resolving capabilities due to their larger apertures and advanced adaptive optics, but even these will only resolve a few of the largest stars, which are approximately 30 milliarcseconds across. To identify solar-like stars, interacting binaries, or the inner regions of planet-forming discs, a telescope must be at least 150 meters in diameter. However, constructing and synchronizing such a telescope for optical use is beyond our current technical and financial capabilities for many years. The only viable option available now is interferometric aperture synthesis. This method combines light from several small, separate telescopes positioned tens or hundreds of meters apart, effectively simulating a larger telescope. The use of optical long-baseline interferometry is growing, as evidenced by publication trends, particularly since 2003, due to the introduction of more accessible interferometers like the Keck Interferometer and the ESO Very Large Telescope Interferometer. Nonetheless, to many astronomers, optical interferometry still feels more like a technical challenge than an appealing high-resolution observation method. This is partly because general users are often unfamiliar with how the visibility measurements in interferometry relate to the shapes of celestial objects. To make optical interferometry more accessible, it needs to transition into an “imaging era,” similar to the advancements made in radio interferometry years ago. We present the first images from the ESO VLTI, indicating that we are beginning this long-awaited imaging phase. The instruments are now performing optimally, and the necessary image reconstruction software is available; however, this is just the initial phase, and many enhancements are still needed. We will outline the improvements expected in the near future.
