There's much room for improvement within existing systems supporting day-to-day operations at ESO (European Southern Observatory). Any changes require careful planning because disruptions could negatively impact ongoing activity; therefore it falls upon User Committees (UC) to identify areas requiring attention based on user needs before informing Engineering Services Organization (ESO).
User groups working with various aspects like instrument development or data analysis might have varying perspectives regarding resource allocation at ESO; therefore communication channels need improvement between user groups like these (e g., instrument builders) and technical staff members responsible for implementing those resources within existing systems .
The role played by User Committees (UC) should include facilitating communication between stakeholders involved with implementing improvements within existing systems while ensuring representation for all user group views across diverse initiatives such as new instrument development or data analysis workflows .
