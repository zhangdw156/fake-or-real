To study star R136 using infrared imagery at ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer ("Very Large Telescope" or VLT), astronomers conducted observations using infrared cameras called "IRDIS" between September and October in 2o15 . They captured high quality images spanning multiple wavelengths - including visible light - covering an area about ten times larger than Earths moon centered on R136s location within its host galaxy cluster . The team achieved excellent results due partly due their use of adaptive optics technology ("adaptive optics") , making it possible see very faint objects like stars very clearly near this target object . They also analyzed their findings against existing astronomical imagery taken by other telescopes like Hubble Space Telescope (HST) , confirming their findings offered superior detail compared previously obtained measurements . These detailed measurements allowed them accurately identify over one thousand individual stars within this region , revealing important information about its structure . Notably they discovered some distortions caused by distance impacts on how starlight appears through space time around this target object while also accounting for these effects when analyzing their results
