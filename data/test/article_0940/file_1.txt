One unique part of the KMOS system is the pickoff module, which captures light from 24 specific areas within the patrol field and directs it to an intermediate focal point at the beginning of the integral-field-unit module. These areas are chosen using robotic pick-off arms that move at pivot points around a circle near the edge of the patrol field. Two stepper motors control radial and angular movements to position the pickoff mirrors with accuracy of less than 0.2 arcseconds. The arms operate in two layers on either side of the Nasmyth focal plane to enhance access to targets in crowded areas. This plane is made flat and telecentric with two all-silica field lenses, one of which serves as the entrance for the cryostat. The design of the arms has been improved for greater target flexibility while maintaining high standards for accuracy and reliability. They will have independent position tracking systems to prevent collisions, which include steps to monitor movement and position encoders, with an additional compression-detection sensor as security. The effectiveness of target allocation has been evaluated using several real fields from deep imaging studies, including configurations mapping high-redshift targets from the FORS Deep Field. Changes in superconducting wire path length within the arms are adjusted using an optical trombone that shares the same lead screw but has a different pitch for the main movement. Additionally, the pickoff module includes the instrumentâ€™s calibration unit and a filter wheel intended to adjust the focus across different bands. The cold stop for the instrument is located at the base of the arm, which creates an intermediate image with a K-mirror assembly that aligns the pickoff areas neatly with the sky. A prototype pickoff arm is currently being made and will undergo thorough testing in a cryogenic setting before producing the complete set of 24 arms. A solid model of one of the arms, along with its patrol space outline, is available for reference.
