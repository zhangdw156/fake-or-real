One unique part of the KMOS system is the pickoff module, which captures light from 24 specific areas within the patrol field and directs it to an intermediate focal point at the entrance of the integral-field-unit module. These areas are chosen using robotic pick-off arms that move in circular paths around the edge of the patrol field. These arms can move radially and angularly thanks to two stepper motors, positioning the pickoff mirrors with a precision of less than 0.2 arcseconds. The arms operate in two layers on either side of the Nasmyth focal plane, enhancing access to targets in densely packed fields. This focal plane is made flat and telecentric by two all-silica field lenses, with one serving as the entrance for the cryostat. The design of the arms has been improved to maximize target allocation while meeting strict standards for accuracy and reliability. Arm positions will be monitored independently to prevent collisions, using both step counting and position encoders, with an additional collision detection sensor for extra safety. The efficiency of target allocation has been tested with various real target fields chosen from deep imaging surveys, including a configuration that overlays the arms on a set of high-redshift targets from the FORS Deep Field. To account for changes in path length within the arm, an optical trombone adjusts the distance using a lead screw with a different pitch for the main radial motion. The pickoff module also includes the instrument calibration unit and a filter wheel that compensates for focus across different bands. The cold stop of the instrument is located at the base of the arm, where an intermediate image is produced by a K-mirror assembly that aligns the pick-off fields to ensure their edges are parallel in the sky. A prototype pickoff arm is currently being built and will undergo extensive testing in a cryogenic environment before the production of all 24 arms. A solid model of one of the pickoff arms, along with its patrol space, is available for reference.
