The current sample of ULIRGs includes 21 binary systems that we have studied to observe the merger phases before they combine and to determine their mass ratios. For these binary ULIRGs, we have measured the kinematic properties of each individual nucleus. Using the stellar dispersions and rotational velocities, we calculate the dynamical masses of the merging galaxies. Our findings show that ultraluminous luminosities are primarily produced by nearly equal-mass mergers; the average mass ratio of the binary ULIRGs is 1.5:1, and 68% of these systems involve mergers with a 1:1 ratio. We also occasionally identify 3:1 mergers, but we lack definitive cases where the dynamical mass ratio suggests that ULIRG activity is being triggered by minor mergers. Mergers with a mass ratio greater than 4:1 generally do not supply enough gas to the merger's center to produce ultraluminous luminosities. These results align with various merger models in existing literature, which predict that ultraluminous activity is effectively initiated during major mergers between two large, gas-rich galaxies.
