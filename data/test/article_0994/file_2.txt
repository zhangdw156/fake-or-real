The current sample of ULIRGs includes 21 binary systems that we studied during early-stage mergers to observe the pre-coalescence phases and evaluate their mass ratios. For these binary ULIRGs, we separately measured the kinematic properties of each galaxy in the pair. Using the stellar dispersions and rotation speeds, we calculated the dynamical masses of the merging galaxies. Our findings show that the very bright luminosities are mostly produced by nearly equal-mass mergers; the average mass ratio for the binary ULIRGs is 1.5:1, and 68% of these mergers are equal ratios of 1:1. We occasionally observe mergers with a 3:1 ratio, but we do not have evidence that any minor mergers trigger ULIRG activity according to their mass ratios. Mergers with mass ratios greater than 4:1 generally do not transfer enough gas to the merger's center to produce ultra-luminous luminosities. These findings align with many merger models that propose that significant activity occurs during major mergers between two large, gas-rich galaxies.
