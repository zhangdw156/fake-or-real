This research project aims at understanding how our galaxy evolved over time by studying its structure from different perspectives:
Milky way's past: The team will analyze elements within star populations across both its outer disk regions (where satellites likely merged) and inner halo areas (where clues about mergers exist). This analysis will help determine when smaller galaxies joined our own galaxy's structure by analyzing their masses timing based on element abundance differences within them compared with other known galactic components like "ring" features around them..
Galactic Disc Structure: They aim at understanding why there are distinct chemical patterns within different parts (thin vs thick) of our galactic disk - whether this difference originates from observational biases or if it represents two separate discs entirely.. They also want to investigate if these differences arise due radial migration where some stellar groups moved into specific locations based on their properties..
Galactic Bulge: Recent studies suggest that this central region isn't as uniform as previously thought - instead containing diverse age ranges metallicities for its star population which makes it difficult for researchers who study it earlier than now.. This project aims at clarifying whether those characteristics stem from an actual bulged shape or just an effect caused by gravitational interactionsmigration events affecting those individual component parts...
