This research project aims at understanding how our galaxy (the Milky Way) evolved over time by studying its structure at different distances from its center:
Outer Disc Inner Halo: The team will analyze specific elements within these areas using precise measurements because their signals are weak compared to other parts; this helps them understand when dwarf galaxies merged into our own galactic system as well as estimate their masses during those mergers based on where they are located now within our galaxy's structure..
Kinematics Overdensities: They will also look for telltale signs like unusual groupings within certain elements suggesting past mergers as well as analyzing how star movement differs near our sun compared with distant parts suggesting possible interactions between different features like barsspiral armsopen clusters etc..
The researchers want answers about why there's such noticeable variation among elements across different parts (thick vs thin disk), whether those variations mean two distinct disks exist or if its an issue caused by observational biases -are there more than one disk?, what about radial migration - do they actually create substructures?. Finally they want answers about whether there was any gap between star formation processes happening differently across both components
Finally they focus on understanding what makes up our galactic center called "the bulge". It used to believed all bulges were formed quickly after birth then enriched rapidly but new research shows its more complex; some might still have classic characteristics while others might have been affected by gravitational forces making them look "buckled" instead! This study seeks answers regarding:
What portion is truly part original "bulge" versus being influenced by other factors like gravitational interactions ?
How much does this core contain halo star populations ?
They also aim at determining if an older shape exists due to past events affecting this area called the bar. Could it provide clues about when exactly these changes occurred based upon agemetallicity analysis performed on individual star populations within this region!
