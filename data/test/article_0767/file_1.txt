To assess their return on investment, major observatories worldwide have created metrics to measure their scientific output. These metrics often focus on the observatories' productivity and their impact on the scientific community, typically evaluated through the number of scientific publications using astronomical data and the citations those publications receive. The methods used to create the ESO Telescope Bibliography, which includes all papers based on ESO data, as well as the statistics on publications and citations derived from this database, have been documented. The Telescope Bibliography is accessible online via the “Select References In: ESO/Telescopes” filter at the ADS. A recent paper introduced a new index for measuring research output, called the h-index. Initially designed to assess the productivity of individual researchers, we have recently applied it to telescope statistics by developing h(t), which tracks changes in the h-index over time. This paper applies h and h(t) to selected observatories and VLT instruments. There are limitations to bibliometric studies, especially when comparing different institutions. Despite efforts to standardize the methods used to compile scientific bibliographies, each observatory defines its own criteria for paper selection, leading to inconsistencies. Additionally, the methodologies for compiling telescope bibliographies differ. More significantly, comparing statistics from telescopes is challenging due to the varying characteristics and operations of ground-based and space-based telescopes, different apertures, instrument counts, observation wavelengths, and more. Consequently, any comparisons must be interpreted very carefully to avoid misleading conclusions.
