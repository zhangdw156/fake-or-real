Emission-line ratios are established indicators of how the Interstellar Medium (ISM) becomes ionized. We analyze the [Oiii]/Hb ratio in relation to the [Nii]/Ha ratio for 14 quasar host galaxies that exhibit notable narrow emission lines. These ratios compare high and low ionization emissions to differentiate between high-energy and lower-energy ionization sources. In a plot of these ratios, galaxies with ISM ionized by star formation appear in a different region compared to those ionized by the central quasar. The findings are striking: half of the galaxies show signs of ISM ionization caused by the quasar. All of these are in the process of interaction. Furthermore, the line ratios suggest that even gas located several kiloparsecs from the quasar's center is ionized by the quasar's intense radiation. The brightest objects in our sample indicate that interactions are crucial for the ignition and sustenance of these bright quasars. There is a clear correlation between the brightness of the central quasar and its location in an interacting system. All the bright quasars are found in interacting environments, while the faint ones are primarily in disc-dominated galaxies. Isolated elliptical galaxies only contain moderately bright quasars. When the ionization source of the ISM is stellar, we can estimate the Star-Formation Rate (SFR) using the [Oii] equivalent width. Although a larger sample is needed for definitive conclusions, we observe that three out of four confirmed elliptical hosts have significant [Oii] emission, unlike non-active elliptical galaxies. In cases where it can be measured, SFR levels are similar to those observed in young discs. The gas metallicity indicates how galaxies have developed over time. The hosts in our sample have an average log (O/H)+12 value around 8.4, placing them low on the metallicity scale for spiral galaxies. Only two galaxies have gas metallicity consistent with the average 8.8 typical of spirals, suggesting that star formation has been relatively inefficient and that the quasar activity may be linked to an early evolutionary phase of their host galaxies. However, a statistically significant sample is required to validate this trend, as we focused on objects where the gas is known to be ionized by star formation, primarily a young stellar population.
