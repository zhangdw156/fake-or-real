The VLT/FLAMES system with fiber optics to the Giraffe and UVES spectrographs has transformed spectroscopic research on resolved star populations in nearby galaxies. Its operational modes, sensitivity, and field of view align closely with the needs to study Galactic dSph galaxies. For instance, it is now feasible to measure the abundance of many elements in nearby galaxies for over 100 stars within a 25-diameter field in a single observation. This marks a significant enhancement over earlier, challenging methods using single-slit spectrographs, which could only observe a few stars per galaxy. The DART Large Programme has collected abundance and velocity data for several hundred individual stars across four nearby dSph galaxies: Sculptor, Fornax, Sextans, and Carina. We utilized the VLT/FLAMES facility in low-resolution mode (LR 8, R ~ 8000) to obtain metallicity estimates from the Ca II triplet and precise radial velocity measurements across extensive areas in Sculptor, Fornax, and Sextans, extending to the tidal radius. Figure 1 illustrates the region surrounding the Sculptor dSph galaxy. The large ellipse indicates Sculptor's tidal radius, as determined by Irwin and Hatzidimitriou. The positions observed with VLT/FLAMES are shown as circles, with solid circles marking the 10 analyzed FLAMES pointings and dashed circles representing five additional fields observed in November 2005. The analyzed fields also display the locations of probable member stars (small red squares) and non-members (black crosses). Each of the four galaxies was also examined at high resolution (Giraffe settings HR 10, 1, and 1) in the central region to derive detailed abundances for several key elements, such as Mg, Ca, O, Ti, Na, and Eu for about 100 stars. During the Giraffe high-resolution observations, we also used the fiber feed to the UVES spectrograph to achieve broader wavelength coverage and higher resolution for a sample of seven to ten stars per galaxy. The comparison of results from UVES spectroscopy (R ~ 10000) and Giraffe spectroscopy (R ~ 20000) for the same stars is beneficial in affirming that reliable results can be obtained with lower resolution spectra than previously considered feasible or advisable. This lower resolution presents fewer issues at lower metallicity (e.g., Sculptor) compared to higher metallicity (e.g., Fornax).
