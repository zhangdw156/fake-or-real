The VLT Adaptive Optics Facility Project: Telescope Systems  
The Adaptive Optics Facility is designed to transform UT4 into a specialized Adaptive Telescope. The current secondary mirror (M2) will be replaced with a new M2-Unit that features a 1170-actuator deformable mirror. The three focal stations will have instruments that are modified for the new capabilities of this telescope. Two instruments have been selected for the two Nasmyth foci: Hawk-I with its AO module GRAAL, which provides Ground Layer Adaptive Optics (GLAO) correction, and MUSE with GALACSI for GLAO correction and Laser Tomography Adaptive Optics correction. A future instrument for the Cassegrain focus is yet to be determined. The adaptive corrections require several guide stars, so a Four Laser Guide Star Facility (4LGSF) is being created as part of the AO Facility. Testing convex mirrors like the VLT M2 is particularly challenging, and significant effort is being assigned to this task. ASSIST is a test bench that will enable the testing of the Deformable Secondary Mirror and both instruments under simulated turbulence. This article concentrates on the telescope systems (Adaptive Secondary, Four Laser Guide Star Facility, RTC platform, and ASSIST Test Bench). The following article will cover the AO Modules GALACSI and GRAAL.
