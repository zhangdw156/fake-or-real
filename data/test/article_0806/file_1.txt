The VLT Adaptive Optics Facility Project: Telescope Systems  
The Adaptive Optics Facility is designed to transform UT4 into a specialized Adaptive Telescope. The current secondary mirror (M2) will be swapped for a new M2-Unit equipped with a 1170-actuator deformable mirror. The three focal stations will have instruments that match the new abilities of this UT. Two specific instruments have been chosen for the two Nasmyth points: Hawk-I, with its AO module GRAAL, which provides Ground Layer Adaptive Optics correction, and MUSE, paired with GALACSI, for GLAO and Laser Tomography Adaptive Optics correction. An additional instrument for the Cassegrain focus has yet to be determined. Various guide stars are necessary for the required adaptive corrections, so a Four Laser Guide Star Facility (4LGSF) is being created as part of the AO Facility. Testing convex mirrors, like VLT M2, poses significant challenges, and considerable efforts are assigned to this task. ASSIST is a testing setup that will evaluate the Deformable Secondary Mirror and the instruments with simulated turbulence. This article centers on the telescope systems, including the Adaptive Secondary, Four Laser Guide Star Facility, RTC platform, and ASSIST Test Bench. The next article will cover the AO Modules GALACSI and GRAAL.
