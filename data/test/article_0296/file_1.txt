ATLASGAL is like a special survey that gives us detailed information about how stars form across our galaxy using blind observation techniques (meaning it doesn't rely on any prior knowledge). They found over half a thousand long threads called "filaments" where new stars are forming along their length – most frequently within those filaments that have bigger density (more stars packed into them). These filaments often align themselves along our galaxy's flat plane as well as its spiral arms which suggests they play important roles in how new stars form across our galaxys structure!
By combining ATLASGALs data with observations made by space telescopes like Plancks HFI instrument we can see even further into interstellar dust distribution across our galaxy - this reveals information about where cold gas resides which is crucial for understanding where new stars are born! The combined analysis tells us there is roughly two percent cold gas spread out over all parts of our galaxy; if you make some simple assumptions about this amount you can then use it together with other measurements like carbon monoxide emissions (which show where hot clouds exist) to estimate how much molecular gas exists overall—that number comes out around one trillion solar masses! Finally using all this information combined gives us clues about how many new stars emerge each year - around one point three trillion solar masses every year!
