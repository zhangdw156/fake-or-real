MLLoader's study uses its unique dataset (ATLASGAL) to create a comprehensive list (catalogue) of filamentous structures found throughout our galaxy (the Milky Way). These filaments were found across distances ranging between two and twenty parsecs (a measure often used for distances within our galaxy), showing high levels of new star birth within them - about twenty percent - particularly those that have higher proportions by length compared to other filaments.. The discoveries also suggest that these filamentous structures are closely linked both spatially (aligned along our galactic plane) as well as temporally (associated specifically with spiral arms).
To further investigate this connection between large scale structure and star formation activity on even larger scales they combined their findings from ATLASGAL with data gathered by space telescopes like Planck HFI which can see deeper into our galaxy than ground based observation equipment . Through this combination they were able to map out cold dust distribution revealing information about how much "dense" gas there is present at specific locations across our galaxy . Their analysis revealed that while only about two percent if all matter is actually "dense" gas , this amount still represents roughly one trillion solar masses . Finally they calculated that based on both density measurements as well as overall mass ,our Milky Way produces roughly one point three trillion suns worth or material each year through new stars being born .
