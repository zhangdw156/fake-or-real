Recent research has uncovered new insights into star clusters found within galaxies, challenging established views of their formation. These clusters often serve as testing grounds for models studying low-mass stars. However, the simplicity previously attributed to these clusters is now being challenged by observations and data analysis, suggesting a more complex evolutionary history than initially believed. This complexity is particularly evident in globular clusters, which contain ancient stars and can shed light on the early stages of our galaxy's evolution. To accurately compare different star clusters, researchers aim for consistent measurements of metallicity across individual stars within each cluster. While progress has been made, a comprehensive analysis of metallicity remains incomplete for most clusters. This study presents some surprising findings that challenge existing understandings and offer exciting new discoveries in the field of stellar cluster research.
