The relationship between the color of our targets and their metallicity is shown in Figure 2 (right panel). In a group of stars with little age variation, metal-poor stars would appear blue, while metal-rich stars would look redder. This is illustrated by three isochrones with metallicities similar to those in Carina and reflecting the age of its oldest stars. However, there is no clear connection in the data. It is impossible to determine the metallicity of an individual star solely from its color and brightness on the RGB when looking at mixed-age populations like those in Carina. Our findings support previous claims that Carina exhibits an age-metallicity degeneracy; in this case, higher metallicities reduce the effects of younger ages, contributing to the observed narrow RGB. Additionally, there are several metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < –1.9) positioned to the right of the most metal-rich isochrone. Each physical system that corresponds to such isochrones has a Red Giant Branch of limited width, despite a ‘fixed’ metallicity. This effect becomes more noticeable in the lower part of the RGB, where the different isochrones are closer together, resulting in overlapping branches. Therefore, for any star of a specific metallicity and age, there will be a wide range of colors. Considering this and the potential for photometric errors, these factors will significantly influence the data, more so than uncertainties in metallicities, and can explain the increased variability in the color-magnitude diagrams. We also noted a higher concentration of metal-rich, likely intermediate-age stars in the galaxy's inner regions compared to more metal-poor stars, as shown in the cumulative plot of the stars’ galactocentric radii. However, metal-poor stars are found throughout the galaxy. This pattern aligns with the observed population depicted in sets of Yonsei-Yale isochrones at an age of 12.6 Gyrs and (from left to right) [Fe/H] = –2.3, [Fe/H] = –1.7, and [Fe/H] = –1.3, which illustrate Carina’s significant age-metallicity degeneracy and the gradient suggesting a central concentration of intermediate-age stars. This supports the notion that more metal-rich stars are also younger. One possible explanation for this gradient is that the more metal-enriched gas dissipates more effectively. It might also indicate that the material available for star formation is more likely to be retained in the center of the galaxy's shallow gravitational potential well.
