MLLoader framework
The Atacama Large Millimetresubmillimetre Array's sensitivity has led researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech University Center to explore its potential use as part or all low frequency radio wave astronomy research lab due its sensitivity..
A major undertaking involved modifying its design so that it could function like one large dish instead if many small dishes -- known as "phased" - allowing researchers access new levels analysis capabilities previously unavailable because they would have been limited due constraints inherent within individual dishes setup..
The "Phased Array" approach took nearly eight years worth off research efforts due its complexity; requiring additional hardware such as fiber optic links between various sites plus other upgrades like replacing outdated clocks with more accurate ones..
In addition there were numerous software changes added that allowed scientists utilize this technology effectively...
A significant milestone came when researchers began making this capability accessible through standard proposals submitted via NASA's proposal system starting back at least two decades ago...
