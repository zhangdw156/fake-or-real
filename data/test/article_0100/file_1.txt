ALSA is one if its kind telescope designed specifically at detecting submillimetre wavelengths light using multiple large dishes spread across Chile's Atacama Desert . While not originally envisioned this way , scientists realized that combining these dishes could enhance its sensitivity significantly when used alongside Very Long Baseline Interferometry(VLSI). To achieve this goal they created "The Almas Phased Array", which uses sophisticated electronics like beamformers that combine individual antenna signals into one powerful wavefront equivalent roughly similar size as adding another massive dish . This allows astronomers access deeper insights about celestial objects through enhanced resolution capabilities previously unavailable via traditional methods . This process involved extensive upgrades including new hardware like fiber optic links , advanced clocks ,and specialized software tools such as "ALMAS VLM" program that fine tunes each antenna individually before observation allowing them all work together seamlessly . Through collaborative efforts between researchers worldwide , this upgrade now allows astronomers around globe access its unique capabilities within their research projects involving astronomical phenomena requiring high resolution observations such as studying supermassive black holes at cosmic scales .
