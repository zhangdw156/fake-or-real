The camera needs to capture faint targets with low noise, record rapid changes across time, and have a wide range in brightness. Our implementation makes these capabilities a priority within its limits. The PICNIC detector covers a wavelength range from 850 nm to 2500 nm, boasting 60-65% quantum efficiency. Two filter wheels inside the cold storage compartment select the light bands: H-band (1.5–1.82 μm) or K-band (2.0–2.36 μm). The second wheel typically has neutral density filters for lower brightness objects, with ND = 0.6, ND = 1.4, and ND = 2.0.  The PICNIC detector offers a unique feature: non-destructive readout – you can perform partial integration without resetting the system. A differential amplifier (increased gain) inside the cold storage compartment enhances resistance to electromagnetic noise. Signals are sent from the cryostat via a shielded wire route to a fast converter (250 ns, 16 bits) for digital recording in a warm electronics space. Signal timing and control patterns, updated at a frequency of 5 MHz, offer a high level of precise control over the system's operation. Each pixel's readout time is limited by the intrinsic speed of the PICNIC array (typically 6 μs), while repeated A/D conversions in similar bursts reduce noise. The detector’s noise and amplification were measured using standard statistical calculations based on electron counts, allowing for calibration of gain.
