To achieve ambitious targets set by KLASS survey observations requiring extreme data optimization were crucial challenges faced during analysis:
Detecting faint Ly emissions from objects at high redshift proved difficult due limitations on continuum detection using KMOS instruments and lack accurate positional identification within image pixels due high redshifts candidates being undetected on continuum light only .
Accurate background subtraction needed for achieving minimal noise levels required meticulous work while also avoiding spurious line identifications caused by subtle systematic errors impacting accuracy .
Precisely quantifying signal strength per pixel within extracted spectra was essential for evaluating significance levels both positive detections and negative results (non detections ) requiring statistical analysis .
The study involved extensive optimization and characterization adjustments made within ESO pipeline version 1..4..3 , details provided elsewhere (Mason et al.,2019). A key result demonstrated through figure one showed improved sensitivity across various magnitudes based on spatially unresolved Ly emissions highlighting significant variability impact from sky emission lines prevalent near infrared spectrum affecting overall efficiency calculations .
A second key takeaway highlighted another aspect through comparison between predicted SN using ETC against actual observations revealing discrepancies between estimated and actual signal strength due inherent systematic biases present during sky subtraction process necessitating future observers consider these factors when making predictions .
With thorough understanding gained from these challenges , researchers explored two prominent areas within modern cosmology utilizing carefully characterized data set presented here demonstrating successful outcomes based upon rigorous procedures employed throughout analysis process
