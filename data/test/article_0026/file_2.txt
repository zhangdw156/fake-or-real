Since its launch around six years ago under ESA's support , both VISTA (equipped for infrared observation) VST(using OmegaCam for visible light observations) have been actively conducting astronomical research programs covering various aspects like studying our own galaxy distant galaxies across different wavelengths .
These projects involve numerous international scientists working collaboratively alongside data centers within member states who work closely under ESO oversight .The current focus includes large scale sky scans utilizing both instruments but also exploring deeper areas like spectroscopy using unique instruments such as VIRCAM which soon gets replaced by a new instrument called "4MOST" offering even wider observational capabilities .
While near term future plans look promising , it's important to note that funding limitations may impact continued operations beyond their initial agreements ending around year two thousand twenty one . However , this doesnt preclude potential collaborations between private partners who may continue operating them after their initial tenure ends .
In addition , recent initiatives involving large scale spectroscopic observations focusing on various targets including our galaxy's structure evolution along side other exciting projects like mapping transient objects across vast cosmic distances using Gaia data sets all point towards exciting advancements driven by these telescopes as they continue their research endeavors
