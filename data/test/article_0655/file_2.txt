All currently operational VLT 3D telescopes record spatial and wavelength information that can be easily converted into a cube shape (a grid).  This makes the viewing process possible by requiring the cube to have linearly spaced data in all three dimensions, following the FITS standard. SPHERE is an exception, as it records space using hexagonal lenslets and maintains the original wavelength information, requiring a slightly different process for re-sampling the data. However, the data reduction pipeline for SPHERE will also produce a re-sampled cube for visualization.  With subsequent generations of VLT instruments, error arrays are commonly provided by data reduction pipelines.  To address the lack of a pre-existing FITS standard describing this format, ESO defined a new internal FITS format that describes how to store science data, errors, and quality information within separate extensions of the same FITS file, using the FITS header keywords for relationship management. The ESO 3D visualisation tool not only displays error values but can also incorporate them in internal calculations or analysis.  This capability sets it apart from similar software available elsewhere. Although error and quality information is beneficial for use, the viewer can also function with 3D data without these details. In part of the ESO 3D visualization tool project, all ESO data reduction pipelines were upgraded to produce output compliant with this new format.
