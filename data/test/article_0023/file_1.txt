The existence underground of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at centers or massive galaxies has been proven through observation but we still don't know how they formed or evolved within these structures or what role they play on larger scales like structure development within our universe . There's indirect evidence suggesting that these formations have close relationships with one another; however we need further investigation into what drives that link . To gain further insight into how these systems interact we require larger datasets containing active galactic nuclei (AGNs), spanning various stages in their life cycle across different time periods . This would help us better understand any potential links between these systems based on observable characteristics such as luminosity class , obscuration levels , etc.. While x ray observations offer advantages due less obstruction effects than visible light observations; there aren't enough data available from x ray middle infrared sources yet compared to those observed via visible light methods currently employed based on existing data sets such as SDSS . This lackluster dataset hinders our understanding regarding how these systems evolve together depending on redshift , luminosity class etc.. For comprehensive study we need much larger datasets containing hundreds thousand spectrared objects classified according t o specific characteristics . Fortunately upcoming projects such as eRosita combined with other complementary techniques should help us achieve this goal ; specifically combining them alongside VISTA near IR WISE Mid IR selections along with future efforts from 4 MOST project aims at achieving just that! These projects aim towards identifying up too one million objects across various wavelengths extending out past z 6 over approximately ten thousand square degrees allowing us greater understanding regarding SMBH formations growths within vast scales
