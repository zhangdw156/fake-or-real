Scientists have observed that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) exist at nearly every center point within vast spiral or elliptical galaxies we see nearby in space – but we still don't fully understand how they formed or how they relate directly with these larger structures throughout our universe's history .
We have some clues that suggest these black holes form alongside their surrounding galaxy; however we lack knowledge about exactly what processes link them together . To better understand this relationship across time scales from early on until now , scientists need many examples spanning various stages within an active galactic nucleus life cycle – specifically those emitting radiation across different wavelengths like xrays or infrared light .
Unfortunately , there arent enough observations using these specific wavelengths currently available; especially when considering redshift changes across time - so our understanding about how these relationships evolve through cosmic history remains incomplete . To overcome limitations , future projects like "4MOST" aim at collecting extremely detailed data on millions upon millions potential candidates – utilizing both existing telescopes such as "eROSITA" along with new ones such as "VISTA" and WISE. These observations combined would give us much needed information about how these black holes interact with surrounding stars gas clouds - ultimately helping us figure out if they influence other structures around them over cosmic timescales..
