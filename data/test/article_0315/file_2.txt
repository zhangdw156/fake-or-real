MLLoader's study uses data from NASA's Gaia spacecraft to select specific star types in our own galaxy (the Milky Way). They'll choose objects based on their brightness (magnitude), color ratios indicating age and metal content in addition to their absolute brightness measured through parallax calculations . To focus on ancient star populations called "halo" stars they limit observations primarily within specific areas around our galaxy with high latitude values greater than twenty degrees allowing for more precise analysis due to reduced interference with other distant objects being studied simultaneously.. Despite some overlaps with other projects like '4MIDAFILE', this study prioritizes unique details about ancient star populations within these particular target areas..
