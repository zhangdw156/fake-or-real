We'll choose stars for our study using data from Gaia Data Release 3 based on their brightness (magnitude), color in blue and red light measured by Gaia instruments called "GBP" and "GRP," as well as their absolute brightness (magnitude). To select metal-rich stars specifically: we'll utilize existing data about metallicity when our project begins; this could include information obtained through other surveys like Sky Mapper or by analyzing light collected during different phases of observation with a specific instrument called "Gaia BP." Our selection focuses on halo stars located beyond roughly latitude -20 to 21. This strategy avoids overlapping with other projects that use similar parts of space since they wont use high-resolution fibers in those areas which is ideal because it allows us to observe these distant objects with greater clarity without interference . We expect some overlap between our study area and another project called "4MIDABLE-HR" within a certain range around latitude -29 to 18. To avoid confusion both projects may exchange spectra collected during observations so everyone can benefit!
