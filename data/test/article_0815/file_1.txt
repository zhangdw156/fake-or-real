Summarize this broad field. Key questions include: What drives the growth of black holes? Can we measure new relativistic effects near black holes quantitatively? What is dark matter? What is dark energy? Did inflation occur? Is standard cosmology based on correct physical principles? Could dark energy be a result of a different gravitational law related to extra dimensions? Might fundamental constants change? The high spatial resolution of an ELT will enable us to investigate the "sphere of influence" of black holes at great distances and measure their abundance and masses. Collaboration with VLTI and JWST is particularly crucial. Astronomy is well-suited to analyze dark energy and inflation effects, as well as contribute to our understanding of dark matter and physics laws. The ELTâ€™s large collecting area will lead to significant advancements, like studying Type Ia supernovae beyond current limits, potentially up to redshifts of about four, allowing us to assess the Universe's expansion history and dark energy effects. With a very high-resolution, stable spectrograph, we could observe the Universe's expansion in "real time" over one or two decades. This direct measurement should correlate with geometrical observations, such as those from supernovae, providing a vital test of our Universe model and its foundation in general relativity. A highly stable, high-resolution spectrograph would also enhance the accuracy of measuring changes in fundamental constants, such as the fine structure constant, by two orders of magnitude compared to current methods. This measurement is crucial, as variations could indicate extra dimensions as suggested by string theory and differentiate between dynamic dark energy models and Einstein's cosmological constant. Only astronomy can explore these constants in distant regions of space-time. Absorption in the spectra of far-off sources caused by intervening clouds of neutral hydrogen reveals information about the Universe's structure on small scales, which can be used, along with larger scale measurements, to test inflation models.
