We calculate the masses of stars in galaxies by comparing the multi-color photographic data of each galaxy against models of star populations that account for various factors, including redshift, star-formation histories, dust interference, and starburst levels. Figure 2 illustrates how galaxies are distributed based on their mass and redshift for the FDF (squares) and GOODS-S (triangles). We represent the age of each galaxy using colors, where blue indicates young galaxies (age < 1 billion years) and red signifies older populations (age > 5 billion years). Remarkably, Figure 2 shows that the most massive galaxies generally contain the oldest star populations at all observed redshifts. In our lowest observed redshift range, around z ~ 0.5, the mass function closely aligns with the local mass function. The depth of the FDF, at I ~ 26.8, lets us reach the faint end of the mass function down to 10^8 solar masses, which is a decade lower in mass than previously noted, without changing its slope. Moreover, the slope in the faint denomination remains consistent with the local value of about 1.1 up to z ~ 1.5. Our findings concerning the mass function also align well with results from MUNICS and K0 surveys for z < 2. The mass function shows consistent evolution up to roughly z ~ 2, with its normalization decreasing by 50% at z = 1 and by 70% at z = 2, although the largest fluctuations occur at masses exceeding 10^10 solar masses. Possible ancestors of todayâ€™s L > L* galaxies appear much less frequently above z ~ 2. However, even at elevated redshifts, there's still presence of galaxies with M > 10^11 solar masses (though in diminished quantities). Beyond z ~ 2, evolution accelerates. Figure 4 compares the evolution of number densities between massive galaxies and those of lesser mass, bringing together our two survey areas. The results suggest that highly massive galaxies share a similar evolutionary pattern with their lower mass counterparts and don't diminish significantly quicker with increasing redshift. At z = 1, the stellar mass density is 50% of the local value; at z = 2, it reaches 25%, and at z = 3 and z = 5, we observe that M > 10^11 solar masses makes up at least 15% and 5% of the total stellar mass, respectively.
