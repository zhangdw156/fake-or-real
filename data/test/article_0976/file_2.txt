We calculate the masses of stars in galaxies by comparing their multi-color brightness measurements to various models that examine factors like distance, star formation history, dust interference, and starburst activity. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of galaxies based on mass and distance for the FDF (squares) and GOODS-S (triangles). We also use color coding to indicate the age of each galaxy based on the best-fitting model, with blue representing young galaxies (under 1 billion years) and red for older ones (over 5 billion years). A key observation from Figure 2 is that the most massive galaxies tend to have the oldest stars across all distances. In the lowest distance range, around z ~ 0.5, the mass distribution aligns closely with that observed locally. The depth of the FDF (I ~ 26.8) enables us to extend our mass measurements down to 10^8 solar masses, a decade lower than previous estimates without changing the slope. Additionally, the faint end slope aligns with the local value of about 1.1 up to z ~ 1.5. Our mass function also matches well with MUNICS and K0 findings for distances less than z = 2. The mass function shows a smooth evolution at least to z ~ 2, with the normalization decreasing by 50% at z = 1 and by 70% at z = 2, with the most significant changes for masses over 10^10 solar masses. These are likely the ancestors of todayâ€™s more luminous galaxies, which are significantly less common beyond z ~ 2. Nevertheless, we observe that massive galaxies with over 10^11 solar masses exist even at the highest distances we examine, although in smaller amounts. Beyond z ~ 2, the changes accelerate. In Figure 4, we compare the evolution in number density of massive galaxies to that of less massive ones across our two survey areas. We find that high-mass and low-mass galaxies evolve similarly and do not disappear at a faster rate with increased distance. At z = 1, the stellar mass density is 50% of what we see today. At z = 2, 25% of the local density has formed, and at z = 3 and z = 5, at least 15% and 5% of the stellar mass respectively is accounted for in galaxies with more than 10^11 solar masses.
