Type Ia supernovae are important for studying the expansion of the universe because their brightness is consistent and allows scientists to calibrate measurements.  To understand the evolution of the universe with greater precision, researchers are using surveys like the LSST and WFIRST to find high-redshift (far away) supernovas. As the number of these discoveries increases, there's a need for larger scale surveys that cover low-redshift supernovae. This is particularly important because nearby supernovae serve as anchors for accurate measurements of how the universe expanded in its past and provides detailed insights into their properties.

The LSQ survey systematically scans specific areas of the sky multiple times to detect supernovae. It uses a rolling search technique, re-observing most fields in these designated areas for several months. Once sufficient observations have been collected in good conditions, the reference image of the field is made. Subsequent images are processed through the LSQ subtraction pipeline which removes this initial reference and identifies any changes by subtracting it from the original images. A typical nightly scanning process identifies approximately 1000 potential supernova candidates. These candidates require visual inspection to distinguish them from noise artifacts before they are further analyzed.

Spectroscopic follow-up observations confirm these candidate supernovae, typically targeting those near or on top of galaxies and showing unusual variability patterns that indicate a potential star explosion. The LSQ survey covers a large area in specific regions (â€“25 to +25 degrees declination) allowing observers in the northern and southern hemispheres to contribute to these findings. This effort has already discovered hundreds of supernovae. Over 100 have been confirmed by other researchers through spectroscopic follow-up using the ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO) which utilizes an EFOSC spectrometer on the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT).
