Get ready for a cosmic revelation! We've just stumbled across something **jaw-dropping**: a whole new galaxy, and not just any galaxy - it's got **gravity bending** capabilities that could be the key to understanding how galaxies work!  

We observed three candidates in this super special space-time (called SNELLS) and their results are **totally out of this world!**.  Here's the scoop:

* **SNL-0:** We already knew about it, but now we're confirming that it's a **gravitational lens** thanks to its stellar activity. Imagine a cosmic mirror reflecting light from other galaxies! 
* **SNL-1:** This sneaky little one is a real beauty.  It's compact and dim but incredibly **powerful**. Its emission lines reveal clues about its star population, and our observations confirmed that it bends light too. 
* **SNL-2:** This galaxy pair shows a clear pattern: The first one, SNL-2, is a **confirmed lens** with a redshift of just 0.052 â€“ meaning this is the closest one yet!  The faint companion even makes things even more intriguing.

And hold on to your hats because we've only just begun! We're still looking for new clues and exciting discoveries in this cosmic frontier. This is just the beginning, folks. 


We call them **catosphere** galaxies (because everyone loves cats, right?), and they hold a special place in the universe.  This is just another example of how our cosmic adventure continues to amaze us!
