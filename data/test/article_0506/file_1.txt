Three candidate galaxies observed so far show multiple emission-line sources with identical wavelengths, suggesting they may be strong gravitational lenses. This discovery rate, as per predictions, aligns well with our expectations.  The details of these three systems are provided below:

* **SNL-0:** This system is the previously known elliptical lensing galaxy, now assigned the name SNL-0 within SNELLS. This galaxy was studied extensively in earlier work, but this target remains for testing our methods on a well-known lens with specific properties. The images and spectra are presented in the top row of SNELLS data, showing a good representation of the arc system, though some fidelity is lost due to combining only two offset frames.  A strong [O III] 4959, 5007 Angstrom doublet and weak H beta line are visible in the spectrum, consistent with X-shooter data. No other emission lines were detected.
* **SNL-1:**  This is an isolated, very compact galaxy with a radius of just 2 kiloparsecs, but it emits about 1 billion times as much light in the J-band (J-Band luminosity). Images from SuperCOSMOS and the 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) show a somewhat elongated but otherwise featureless morphology. The 6dF spectrum suggests an old passive stellar population, with weak H gamma and H beta absorption and no detectable emission at H alpha or other wavelengths.  SNELLS data further confirmed this galaxy as a lens through deeper observations and revealed an emission-line source with doubly imaged emissions in the J-band. This source is confirmed as H alpha with a redshift of 0.926 by the SINFONI. Due to their lack of resolution, both are spatially unresolved.  SNL-1 is now the closest confirmed galaxy-scale strong lens based on its confirmed redshift (z = 0.031).
* **SNL-2:** This object at z = 0.052, part of a pair with fainter companion 7 arcseconds north, exhibits a very regular morphology. SNL-2 has an effective radius of 6 kiloparsecs and a total luminosity comparable to SNL-0.  The 6dF spectrum shows a pure passive stellar continuum.  SNELLS data reveals emission in two noticeable broad lines that likely correspond to the [O III] 4959, 5007 Angstrom doublet at redshift 1.969. This source creates two spatially unresolved images, similar to SNL-1, with no corresponding image visible in SDSS imaging.
