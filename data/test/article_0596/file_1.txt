The European Advanced Research Consortium (ARC) operates despite lacking formal legal agreements between ESO and the individual ARC nodes. Though ESO acts as a supervisor and organizer, each node retains autonomy in its structure and operations. The nodes decide their staff size, expertise focus, and funding through various national programs.  Their funding durations vary between one to five years. Instead of strict contracts, the partnership relies on trust, communication, and collaboration, forming a symbiotic relationship. Through this network, ESO provides vital services for European ALMA users. In return, ARC nodes build their own expertise in ALMA operations and receive funding. Coordinating these diverse elements requires dedicated effort from both ESO and each node.  ESO employs three astronomers as the EU ARC Manager, acting as liaison and coordinator, connecting the network to ALMA's management teams and serving as a point of contact for ESO's management. 

In addition to the EU ARC manager, an ARC node liaison member works on behalf of the nodes to oversee support provision and overall coordination, closely collaborating with the ARC Manager. Finally, the ARC node coordinator acts as a communication point for all ARC staff members, managing communication channels and responsibilities.  These three individuals, known as the ARC Network Management Team, maintain the network's smooth operation. At each node, an individual representative manages communication between the ARC network and their local team. This team, along with the ARC Network Management Team, forms the ARC Coordinating Committee (ACC), responsible for decision-making through consensus within the ARC network.
