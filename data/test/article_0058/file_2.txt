The Hubble Space Telescope's Frontier Fields program investigates how galaxies formed and evolved over billions years by observing powerful gravitational lenses called "clusters." This project uses both deep field images from Hubble itself along with data from Spitzer telescope for various wavelengths allowing scientists a detailed look at these distant galaxies unseen before due their faintness or location within these clusters . The program will help us understand how many faint galaxies exist early on in cosmic history as well as how they have changed over time - all contributing insights into galactic development throughout universe's lifespan .
