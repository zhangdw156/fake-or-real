underground scientists are using data from NASA's Hubble space telescope along with data from another space telescope called Spitzer to study how galaxies formed early in our universe's history up until present day . These scientists want to learn about very distant faint galaxies which they can only see because they are being magnified by massive groups or clusters that act like lenses . To do this they took many pictures over a long period using both telescopes , allowing them to see details about these distant objects . These images will help us understand how stars form , evolve over time , their appearance as well as their relative abundance as we look back into time . This unique set up allows researchers a clear view into what happened during those initial billion years after creation .
