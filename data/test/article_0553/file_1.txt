While we know how airglow forms, scientists are observing more occurrences of this phenomenon in images taken at ESO's observatories in Chile recently. It's unclear whether the increase is due to changes in weather patterns or something else.  Digital cameras might be contributing significantly, as they allow us to capture fainter details of the night sky more frequently. However, identical cameras show drastically different skies over a short period. Airglow changes with solar activity; thus, the 11-year solar cycle may impact its brightness. While the last peak occurred in 2014, this was one of the weakest maxima on record. The current solar cycle's peak might be partly responsible for the increased airglow occurrences captured over recent years. It's also worth noting that ESO's observatories are located near the South Atlantic Anomaly, where the Earth's magnetic field is weakened and allows more charged particles from the sun to penetrate into the atmosphere, affecting the red airglow. In addition to this, geomagnetic latitude influences the observed variability of the airglow. Regardless of how it happens, airglow has become a common part of the spectacular celestial displays at ESO sites, even at one of Earth's darkest places, a sky never completely dark.
