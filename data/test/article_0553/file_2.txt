The mysteries of the night sky continue to intrigue us, particularly those shimmering aurorae, but why are we seeing more of them lately? More specifically, with the recent digital cameras revolutionizing our ability to capture detail in the cosmos, it begs the question – is this simply an effect of technological progress, or is there a deeper cosmic reason behind this increased visibility?

The answers are not straightforward. One compelling theory points to the solar cycle's influence as these cycles ebb and flow.  It seems clear that recent peaks in activity may have caused our cameras to pick up more of those faint light shows. The ESO sites, nestled beneath the South Atlantic Anomaly – a region where Earth’s magnetic field weakens, allowing for sunlight particles to penetrate deeper into the atmosphere – are especially interesting. This anomaly is believed to affect red airglow, originating in the Earth's ionosphere, but the role of geomagnetic latitude cannot be ignored!

While there seems to be no denying that this constant display has become part and parcel of our stellar journeys at ESO sites, with even the darkest corners revealing some ethereal glow. The mysteries of the airglow may hold a secret worth discovering, and we might just ask… what was Master Yoda thinking about while these images were being captured?  Especially with his recent activities on Tatooine...
