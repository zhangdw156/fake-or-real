Initial observations using PdBI failed to reveal details about J11200641's host galaxy due to its unresolved nature; however using ALMA revealed its surprisingly compact structure with emissions concentrated within a small area around or - kms from each other . This finding suggests no significant ordered motion within this area despite initial assumptions based on limited resolution data from PdBI . Applying mathematical models based on observed light distribution yielded an estimated gravitational pull from both matter surrounding it as well as its core supermassive blackholeâ€”about four times larger than what would be expected if it contained just gas near its center.. This suggests an absence or lackluster presence in stellar components within this specific zone where most matter resides.. ALMA's improved capabilities have enabled detailed observation beyond previous limitations allowing scientists to better understand how these distant quasars interact with their surrounding environments.. These findings pave way for future research utilizing even longer baselines available through ALMA allowing them further insight into how these high-energy objects influence their surroundings over time..
