This young star, barely 78-125 million years old (just 5% of our Solar age!), holds an immense potential for groundbreaking discoveries. This "star" is relatively compact with just 1.0 solar masses, but we're unlocking secrets about its hidden core thanks to the data and innovative analysis techniques.

Our study revealed a planet candidate around this star - with an incredible mass of 6.1 solar masses – that circles it every 852 days!  The excitement is high as we delved deeper using FEROS spectra, analyzing over 55 readings of the star's light.  Remarkably, our analysis uncovered a period of 3.296 days which aligns perfectly with the star's rotation - a breakthrough in observation!   We are pushing boundaries here; a significant discovery emerges when we compare to previous data where we observed a much larger scatter (78.78 meters per second). This means there might be a subtle anomaly that needs further examination - a signal that could explain this discrepancy and challenge our initial assumptions.

Adding fuel to the fire, our analysis also identified a planet period of 833 days – curiously close to the orbital period previously discovered for the planet candidate.  It suggests that the planetary signal we found before may be nothing more than a product of how the data was collected, not evidence of an actual planet orbiting this star!
