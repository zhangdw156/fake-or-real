This young star is about 5% of the age of our Sun. It has a mass of one solar mass and rotates every 3.296 days based on observations. A planet with a mass of 6.1 solar masses was found, orbiting around this star with an orbital period of 852 days.  Analysis of 55 spectra using FEROS indicated a possible period of 3.296 days in the star's rotation. This period matches the period we obtained for the star's speed and the scattering was only 36.4 meters per second, significantly less than previous estimates. Another period, 833 days, was also found but this is linked to how the data was sampled. This suggests that the previously announced planet might be caused by data processing errors rather than an actual planet orbiting the star.
