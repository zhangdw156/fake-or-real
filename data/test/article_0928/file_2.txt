During the evaluation of options for the European ELT, two design proposals were put forward by the ESE working groups for further examination: a classical Gregorian design and a new five-mirror design. Detailed trade-off analyses were conducted for both designs. The ESE subcommittee of the STC oversaw the design process, and meetings were held with the telescope, science, and instrumentation working groups. Both designs feature 42-meter diameter aspheric primary mirrors constructed from over 900 hexagonal segments, each about 1.45 meters across. The Gregorian design includes a 4.8-meter concave secondary mirror and can utilize the beam either at a deep Cassegrain location or, using a 5-meter tertiary flat mirror, redirect it to the Nasmyth focus. The five-mirror design includes an active 6-meter convex secondary mirror followed by a mildly aspheric concave tertiary mirror within the primary's central obstruction, with two flat mirrors directing the beam to the Nasmyth foci. Both designs yield a 10 arcminute diameter, f/15 beam at the Nasmyth focus, where the field is limited by the tertiary size in the Gregorian design, while in the five-mirror design, it's determined by the quaternary mirror's hole size and the central obstruction. Before examining design details and trade-offs, it is important to discuss the telescope's primary mirror. The E-ELT's primary mirror will require phasing, and we have been developing both a phasing method and necessary sensors as part of the FP6 ELT Design Study program and Project Office. An active phasing experiment will assess various phasing sensors on a small segmented mirror, which will be positioned at the visitor focus of the VLT. This setup aims to enhance the telescope's capacity to create and correct aberrations on demand for optimal phasing. Advanced sensors and actuators are being developed through the FP6 program. At ESO, we acknowledge our limited expertise with segmented mirrors. The inclusion of Spain in ESO will enhance our knowledge, and the availability of technical nights on the GTC will aid in expanding our expertise. To incorporate adaptive optics into the telescope as suggested by the ESE working groups, a suitable location for an adaptive mirror is necessary. In the Gregorian design, the secondary acts as the deformable mirror, which is effectively aligned with the ground layer and will also correct tip-tilt components of wavefront error. In the five-mirror design, the quaternary serves as the deformable mirror, also conjugated to the ground layer, while the fifth mirror in the system addresses tip-tilt compensation.
