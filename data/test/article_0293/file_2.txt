After selecting participants for their surveys within a community group (the "Participating Communities"), scientists from these communities join a larger team called "Science Team" formed from both participating surveys ("Consortium Surveys"). This team works together with an advisory board ("Science Coordination Board") made up of community survey leaders who also guide support for various workgroups within 4MOST (evolving telescopes). In addition to providing resources for workgroups like planning surveys strategies or ensuring data quality control in each project's pipeline system; these communities contribute staff effort towards making sure that observation plans are effective across all projects involved in this collaboration . The final plan is then established based on merging catalogue data between participating communities and consortium surveys; it sets out how observations should occur across all targets selected under this collaborative program . This collaborative approach ensures that any modifications made during observation phases require approval from both ESO (European Southern Observatory) as well as its scientific advisory board before implementation can take place . Non-participating organizations are able access tools needed for creating individual observing blocks but must receive prior approval before making substantial alterations after initial submission via ESO..
