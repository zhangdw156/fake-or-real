The five-year Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) began in mid-2003 with the goal of discovering and monitoring about 500 Type Ia supernovae to understand dark energy. The square-degree imager MegaCam on the 3.6-m CFHT allowed for efficient surveys of large sky areas, making it possible to find Type Ia supernovae up to redshift z = 1 on a regular basis. The optical data comes from the Deep component of the CFHT Legacy Survey (CFHT-LS), which observes each of four fields every three or four days during dark periods, around six times a year. As optical events are detected, repeated imaging creates high-quality light curves to measure the peak brightness, light-curve widths, and colors needed for cosmological studies. Additionally, there is a large database of precise photometric data that provides well-sampled, multi-color light curves for various optical transient classes.
