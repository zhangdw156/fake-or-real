Spectra from a sample of K giants in four Bulge fields were obtained using the FLAMES–GIRAFFE spectrograph at the VLT-UT2, resulting in a resolution of approximately R 20,000. The total wavelength coverage was about 760 Angstroms across different configurations: HR 13 plus HR 14 plus HR 15 (program 071.B-0617) and HR 11 plus HR 13 plus HR 15 (program 073.B-0074) for the varied fields. Details of a typical star’s spectrum observed with both GIRAFFE and UVES modes are outlined. Information about the observed fields and the number of target stars in each is provided, along with exposure times ranging from about 1 to nearly 5 hours, based on the setup and star brightness classifications (bright and faint) to ensure that each final spectrum had a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of about 60. The actual S/N may differ among targets within a field. While obtaining GIRAFFE data, UVES spectra for approximately 50 stars that overlap with the GIRAFFE sample were also recorded. These higher resolution spectra (R about 45,000) allow for more accurate element abundance measurements and help identify systematic errors in the GIRAFFE data (R about 22,000). The individual spectra were processed using the GIRBLDRS pipeline from the FLAMES consortium, involving bias subtraction, flatfield correction, extraction, and wavelength calibration. All spectra for each star (between 1 and 5 depending on the field) were aligned by correcting for heliocentric radial velocity before combining them into a single spectrum per setup and star. About 20 GIRAFFE fibers on each plate were designated for empty sky regions. Visual checks were employed to remove any sky spectra that showed noticeable stellar influence, and valid sky spectra were co-added into a single image. This was then subtracted from each target star's spectrum. Equivalent widths (EWs) for chosen iron lines were evaluated using the automatic software DAOSPEC.
