Spectra from a sample of K giants in four Bulge fields were obtained at the VLT-UT2 using the FLAMESâ€“GIRAFFE spectrograph, with a resolution of about 20,000. The data covered a wavelength range of approximately 760 Angstroms across different configurations: HR 13 plus HR 14 plus HR 15 (program 071.B-0617) and HR 11 plus HR 13 plus HR 15 (program 073.B-0074) for various fields. A typical star spectrum captured with both the GIRAFFE and UVES modes is discussed. The details of the observed fields and the number of target stars in each are included. Total exposure times ranged from around 1 to nearly 5 hours, influenced by the setup and the brightness of the stars (targets were categorized as bright or faint) to achieve a final signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of about 60. The actual S/N varied among the targets in a given field. While obtaining GIRAFFE data, UVES spectra for about 50 stars were also collected, overlapping with the GIRAFFE sample. These higher resolution spectra (R about 45,000) allow for more accurate element abundance measurements and help identify systematic errors in the GIRAFFE data (R about 22,000). Individual spectra were processed using the GIRBLDRS pipeline from the FLAMES consortium, which included bias subtraction, flatfield correction, extraction, and wavelength calibration. All spectra for each star (between 1 and 5 depending on the field) were aligned by correcting for heliocentric radial velocity and combined into a single spectrum per setup per star. Approximately 20 GIRAFFE fibers were assigned to empty sky regions on each plate. The sky spectra were inspected to remove any containing clear stellar light and then combined into one sky spectrum, which was subtracted from each target star's spectrum. The equivalent widths (EWs) of selected iron lines were calculated using the automated DAOSPEC code.
