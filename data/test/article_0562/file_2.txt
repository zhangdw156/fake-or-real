SUDARE began observations on October 20, 2011, and has captured images of the Cosmic Dawn Field (CDFs) over 55 time periods using the VST and OmegaCAM instruments. The project imaged the COSMOS field over 30 time periods.  Since its launch, SUDARE has identified approximately one hundred supernova candidates, several active galactic nuclei with variability, and many variable stars. Using spectroscopic observations at both the VLT and Gemini-South observatories, researchers were able to classify a dozen of these candidate supernovae for their type and redshift. These findings have been submitted to the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams. Of the identified SNe, six are Type Ia with an average redshift of 0.5; two are Type Ic and two are Type II, across a range of redshifts between 0.3 and 0.6. Classification was performed using the GELATO tool. Four nearby supernovae (transient) were found in galaxies near the galaxy nucleus within 0.1 arcseconds, exhibiting spectra consistent with Seyfert galaxies.  All supernovae were discovered before maximum brightness, thanks to SUDARE's frequent observation cadence, resulting in both early detection and optimal photometric coverage. The distribution of these SNe by redshift, magnitude, and type aligns well with simulations based on the project's design. The first systematic search for supernovas began approximately 80 years ago at Mount Palomar using a Schmidt telescope equipped with photographic plates.  The focus was to find supernovae by manually scanning overlapping plates taken over different nights, requiring analysis of thousands of images. With modern CCD mosaic cameras, adaptive optics and digital image subtraction, SUDARE can now discover these faint transients even in distant galaxies, leading to greater accuracy than previously possible.
