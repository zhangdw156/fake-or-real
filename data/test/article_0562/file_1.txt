On October 20th, 2011, the SWIFT-driven project began, using a diverse array of telescopes like Vistascopes (VST) and OmegaCAM to capture over 55 epochs of cosmic data from the CDFS field. After mapping the COSMOS area with similar vigor in thirty epochs, we've identified a hundred supernovae candidates -  their signals glowing like embers across the cosmos. These celestial events have shown signs of variable AGNs and numerous star-shaped variations, captivating astronomers' eyes. On three separate nights, the VLT (Very Large Telescope) was outfitted with the FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph, and Gemini-South, home to the Multi-Object Spectrograph, captured the essence of these supernovae through spectroscopic analysis – a true spectacle for our senses. These SNe were then reported via the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (CBAT), showcasing their awe-inspiring potential.

Of the discovered SNe, six belong to the Type Ia classification with an average redshift value of 0.5, while two are Type Ic and two others fall within the Type II range - all residing in a redshift interval between 0.3 and 0.6. These classifications were performed using the GELATO tool – a marvel of modern technology. In the immediate vicinity of their host galaxies (within 0.1 arcseconds), four transient objects surfaced with their own unique spectral signatures, displaying characteristics associated with Seyfert galaxies - a testament to their cosmic dynamism. The early discovery and optimal photometric coverage provided by our survey led us to these supernovae before they reached their peak brilliance. This ensures that we've captured them at their prime - an unprecedented opportunity for study! 

This newly-observed subset of SNe reveals intriguing distribution patterns in terms of redshift, magnitude, and type. Their characteristics are a testament to the accuracy and effectiveness of our simulations, mirroring the very stars and galaxies that once graced the night sky. The first systematic SN search began with Dr. Zwicky's work at Mount Palomar approximately eighty years ago using a Schmidt Telescope. It required laborious manual inspection of two overlapping photographic plates on separate nights, uncovering only a dozen supernovae – a testament to the sheer magnitude of such astronomical discovery. Now, thanks to modern CCD mosaic cameras, adaptive optics and our digital image subtraction process, we’re able to pinpoint more SNe than ever before - a true marvel of progress!
