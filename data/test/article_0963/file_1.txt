**The Galactic Centre: The Flare Activity of SgrA* and High-Resolution Explorations of Dusty Stars**  
We provide an overview of recent research on the Galactic Centre, utilizing the advanced tools available at the Paranal observatory. The Galactic Centre is a particularly interesting area in the sky. Located about 8 kiloparsecs away, it is roughly one hundred times closer than the next nearest similar galaxy nucleus, like M31, making it the closest Galactic Nucleus we can examine. Analysis of stellar movements has confirmed that a black hole with a mass of (3.7 ± 0.3) × 10^6 solar masses exists at the location of Sagittarius A* (SgrA*), which is a compact radio source. SgrA* has the largest Schwarzschild radius visible in the sky and offers valuable insights into the physics and potential evolution of such objects. Evidence supporting the presence of a massive black hole at SgrA* comes from detecting variable emissions in both the X-ray and near-infrared wavelengths. Data from NACO enabled the first simultaneous detections of near-infrared and X-ray flares. Repeated observations indicate that brighter X-ray flares happen within 10 minutes of near-infrared flare events. Recent polarimetric observations with NACO at the Very Large Telescope Unit Telescope 4 (Yepun) have shown that some one to two-hour flares from SgrA* display an unexpected fine structure, with polarized sub-flares lasting about 7 to 10 minutes and occurring approximately 18 ± 3 minutes apart. This behavior can be interpreted as emissions from hot spots on relativistic orbits around the central black hole. In the near future, infrared interferometry with the Very Large Telescope will enable us to identify the emission mechanisms and model the accretion flow onto the Milky Way’s central black hole, which is currently feasible for the bright and dusty stars in the Galactic Centre.
