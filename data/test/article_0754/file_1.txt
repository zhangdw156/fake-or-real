Title: The Current and Future ST-ECF

After 15 years in space, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has an uncertain future, although a fifth servicing mission is possible in the next two to three years. The European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO) have been discussing the future of the Space Telescope â€“ European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF) at ESO's headquarters in Garching, and this article summarizes their findings. The ST-ECF was created by ESA and ESO in 1984 to assist European astronomers with the HST. An article in the STScI Newsletter discusses the group's history and role through 2002, which will not be repeated here. Since HST is now operating far beyond its 15-year design life, both ESA and ESO have been contemplating the ST-ECF's functions in the remaining time of the Hubble project, as well as the needs for maintaining their collaboration in the period after Hubble's mission ends. This article presents the results of these discussions and briefly outlines the group's expected future activities.
