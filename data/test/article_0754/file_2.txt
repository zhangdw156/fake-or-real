Title: The Current and Future ST-ECF

After 15 years in space, the Hubble Space Telescope is facing an uncertain future, though there is a real chance of a fifth servicing mission in the next two to three years. ESA and ESO have been considering the future of the ST-ECF at the ESO headquarters in Garching, and this article presents their findings. The Space Telescope – European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF) was created by ESA and ESO in 1984 to help European astronomers use the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). An article in the STScI Newsletter details the group's history and its changing role up to 2002 and will not cover that in detail here. With the HST already in orbit beyond its intended lifespan of fifteen years, ESA and ESO have been thinking about the roles the ST-ECF should take on during the Hubble project’s remaining active phase—regardless of how long that lasts—and their long-term needs for maintaining such a joint group after Hubble. This article aims to summarize the outcomes of their discussions and outline the expected future activities of the group.
