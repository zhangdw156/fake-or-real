ESO's public surveys release raw observational information immediately upon completion. After basic processing like removing instrument artifacts or adjusting for calibration, they work with each team to prepare standardized datasets that meet specific scientific needs and adhere to established guidelines at both La Silla Paranal Observatory (the site where they were taken) as well as within their own survey management plan. This prepared dataset then gets added into a unified archive alongside all other archive content from La Silla Paranal Observatory through a rigorous Phase 3 audit process designed for quality control before it becomes publicly accessible through this centralized system known as "The Science Archive."
