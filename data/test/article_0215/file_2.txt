ESO's public surveys release raw observational information immediately upon completion. After initial processing for clarity (removing instrument artifacts), calibration, and measurement refinement, scientists receive support from ESO to package their findings according to established standards (like those used at La Silla Paranal Observatory) within designated format guidelines set forth by each survey's management plan. This integrated approach ensures seamless access to these findings within both general archives of scientific datasets as well as within individual observatory archives like La Silla Paranal Observatorys General Archives system via a third-party auditing system called Phase 3 audit which verifies consistency in quality integrity before publication on these platforms for all users .
