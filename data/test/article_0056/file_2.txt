This paper investigates magic youth's views about where magic happens! It's focused on how much "magic" is present when it comes down into considering where these types are formed based off what we can observe about them... And who better than us? We get our answers by looking at light emitted by individual objects within this young upstart structure called "magic youth." It turns out there may be some pretty cool things waiting for us out there!
