This research investigates how environments affect massive stars' evolution using data from deep space telescope observations called MUSE located at La Silla Observatory Chile . They focus on "Leo P", a distant dwarf galaxy known for having very low levels - only around three percent - of oxygen compared to our sun . This makes it ideal for studying how these rare types of star form due it being so close by compared other objects like Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy which is also known as SDIG or Sgr DIr
