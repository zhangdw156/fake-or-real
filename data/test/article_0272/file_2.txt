Over two years, this project will observe about ten active galactic nuclei (AGN) across a wide range (four orders) in luminosity intensity. This data collection aims to understand how fast atoms move within their surrounding regions; specifically if they're influenced primarily by rotation around a supermassive black hole or outward flow caused by radiation pressure from its intense energy output. They'll also investigate whether these movements exhibit orderliness or randomness within their overall structure through analyzing spectral lines derived from these observations; ultimately revealing how much material is being drawn into it based on brightness measurements made combined with existing measurements taken through different methods like reverberation imaging techniques . The team plans on comparing their findings with independent results obtained via reverberation imaging techniques for better understanding where this material originates from within each AGN system studied using interferometry due to its sensitivity towards bright objects such as quasars like 3C273 . Future enhancements could increase GRAVITY's sensitivity allowing researchers to gather information about kinematics (how fast things move), sizes associated with various regions observed including those containing hot dust particles ,and even estimate supermassive black holes masses across larger samples at redshifts up towards z 2 .
