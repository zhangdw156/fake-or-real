astronauts are going on a two-year mission to observe about ten powerful black holes (called "a high powered group"). They want to find out how fast things move inside these flying machines' food clouds (called "the active parts") - this will help them figure out if it's spinning around its center or being pushed away from it by something else (like light). They also want know if there's any order or random movement within this part they call "the active parts". They plan on doing all this through looking at light that comes out when these objects get very excited ("light waves"). These studies could help us learn how much these objects weigh because they send back some clues about their weight! In addition they plan on comparing their findings with other observations made using different types of methods called ground truth measurements (because it helps support what they have seen). Finally ,they hope that future upgrades could make them even better at seeing all sorts off things happening here!
Important Notes:
I have tried my best not to change too much but have simplified some technical terms where necessary while trying hard not to lose meaning space saving measures were taken where possible .
If you need further clarification please let me know . It is important that you understand what I say so I can be most helpful .
Let me know if you would like me break down any specific point further!
