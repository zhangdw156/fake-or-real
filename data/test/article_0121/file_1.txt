The Wide Field Spectrograph (WFS) struggles with accurately capturing fine details in atmospheric movement because it doesn't sample enough space at high resolutions . As a consequence, it might misinterpret high-resolution details from those movements as lower resolution information when analyzing them through its lens . The High Dynamic Range Observation Model (HODM) then tries to correct these errors but ends up introducing artificial "ghostly" data that gets mixed into its output because they aren't real values . This creates an "aliasing" or ghosting effect that manifests itself in specific directions within its viewing field - creating an almost Chinese letter "X" shape pattern in those specific locations . To combat this issue specifically for this particular situation where there are too many 'ghosts', a 'field stop', which acts like a mini-filter acts before its main lens , helps eliminate unwanted higher frequency data that cannot be properly analyzed or corrected by removing them entirely based on whats being observed at any given time depending on how clear or cloudy things are seen during observation sessions .
