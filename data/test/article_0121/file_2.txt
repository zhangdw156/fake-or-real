The Wide Field Spectrograph (WFS) sometimes misinterprets high-frequency atmospheric turbulence because it has limited ability to capture all details at those levels. This leads to an inaccurate representation of certain details in its measurements due to an "aliasing" phenomenon where incorrect information gets added in specific areas within its view field even after correction attempts are made by another system called High Dispersion Optical Mode (HODM).
To address this issue caused by uneven signal distribution and potential distortion within specific areas near where it's correcting for distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence due its limitations in capturing finer detail at higher frequency levels - the system uses a "field stop" element which acts like a sieve or filter that discards unwanted high frequency signals before reaching further analysis systems like HODM for accurate processing . The exact size and placement of this field stop are determined based on how clear or cloudy our observing environment looks at any given time so we make sure we avoid unnecessary distortion from overly harsh viewing conditions while still having enough detail captured for accurate data analysis .
