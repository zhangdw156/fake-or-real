ESO at AAAS

Recently, ESO has gained more public attention, which is due to our focused efforts in communicating about the organization and its projects. Having engaging displays at important fairs and conferences supports this strategy, and our participation in this year’s Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science—our first time attending—aligns with this aim. This meeting is considered one of the largest science gatherings globally, attracting many science journalists, particularly from Europe, which has encouraged more European organizations to consider joining. Additionally, the annual AAAS meetings offer valuable opportunities for interactions between American and European scientists and science policy makers. This year’s meeting occurred from February 16 to 20 at America’s Center in St. Louis, Missouri. Although with around 4,000 attendees it was one of the smaller AAAS events, it still included nearly 200 sessions, such as symposia, lectures, seminars, poster presentations, and career workshops, along with a significant exhibition. ESO's 30 square meter information booth was situated in the main exhibition hall, close to the displays of the National Science Foundation and the European Commission.
