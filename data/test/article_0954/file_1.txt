ESO at AAAS

Recently, ESO has gained more visibility for our organization and projects. This increase is due to a focused public communication effort. Engaging displays at key fairs and conferences are part of this strategy, and ESO’s participation in this year's American Association for the Advancement of Science Annual Meeting is a reflection of that effort. This meeting is one of the largest science gatherings globally and draws numerous science journalists, including many from Europe. This influx is prompting more European organizations to consider attending. Furthermore, the annual AAAS meetings encourage collaboration between American and European scientists and policy makers. This year's event was held on February 16-20 at America's Center in St. Louis, Missouri. With around 4,000 attendees, it was one of the smaller AAAS meetings, yet it included nearly 200 symposia, as well as numerous lectures, seminars, poster presentations, and career workshops, alongside a major exhibition. ESO’s 30 square meter information booth was positioned in the main exhibition area, close to the National Science Foundation and the European Commission displays.
