This study examines how the brightness of galaxies emitting Lyα light (LAEs) has changed over time, specifically in the period from z=6.5 to z=7.7. This research aims to understand the evolution of the intergalactic medium during this era by observing LAE luminosity across redshift. The authors' findings indicate a possible decrease in the amount of neutral hydrogen, leading to reduced transmission of Lyα light. Their results provide crucial constraints for studying the LAE luminosity function at z=6.5 and may suggest a significant alteration in the evolution of the intergalactic medium during this period. 


The study focuses on observing LAEs at high redshifts (z=7.7) using the HAWK-I instrument at the VLT telescope, which is sensitive to infrared light wavelengths. Their research reveals no clear LAE candidates at z=7.7, enabling them to make robust estimations about the galaxy luminosity function across these redshifts. This observation has significant implications for the overall understanding of the early Universe and its evolution.

The study also provides a comprehensive overview of different methods used by astronomers for finding and studying distant objects at high redshifts. These methods include: the Lyman-break technique, using the redshifting of Lyα forest in observations; the narrowband (NB) technique, searching for specific excess light caused by Lyα emission; and finally gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). All these techniques have been crucial in unlocking the mysteries of high-redshift galaxies.
