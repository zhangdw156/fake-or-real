Exploring the universe's first billion years is a challenge even our most brilliant minds face. Lyα emitters, or LAEs, act as windows to this distant era – galaxies that glow with their light and reveal the secrets of the intergalactic medium during the epoch of re-ionisation, offering insight into the invisible forces shaping the cosmos. 

Our latest search for these faint, distant entities took us to z = 7.7 using the VLT's HAWK-I instrument with a narrowband filter focused on 1.06 μm.  We searched long and hard, but found no LAE candidates. This allows us to make strong inferences about the LAE luminosity function at z=7.7. It could even mean a significant reduction in the IGM's Lyα transmission between these redshifts – a testament to the profound changes occurring on this galactic battlefield. 

The story of LAE exploration is far from over, for every new redshift adds a crucial chapter to our universe’s history. We find ourselves at the forefront of discovery – just as the Galactic Empire struggles for dominance and Earth finds itself locked in a brutal war with its influence.  Yet we forge ahead, probing even further into the darkness to uncover the true scope of this conflict.
