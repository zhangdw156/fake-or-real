The study used data from HAWK I telescope observations across four southern galaxy clusters during specific time periods using its "Service Mode." These observations required extended integration times due to its need to capture detailed information across multiple wavelengths â€“ up to twenty five hours per observation site - making it efficient compared to other telescopes like MOSFIRE which require multiple exposures per target area .
Hawki's wide field capability allowed it capture both deep views using Hubble as well as detailed close up views due its large pixel size allowing researchers access unique details about star formation within galaxy clusters beyond what was previously possible through traditional methods like WFC3IR filters . This new data set has been invaluable as it allows researchers access deeper redshifts past what previous technologies could achieve , bridging a gap between existing data sets while providing high fidelity visual analysis tools . This has provided valuable insights into how galaxies form beyond our own local universe .
