Using GRAVITY telescope data, scientists studied two stars orbiting together called S Coronae Australis (S CrA). These stars are similar in age but one is larger than its companion - they are both classified as T Tauri stars, young objects that form discs around them when they form from gas clouds â€“ these are called protoplanetary discs
The researchers used special techniques to study these systems at high detail by observing them separately then combining those images into one picture for better clarity
They found evidence for both disks around each star with sizes about half that measured for our own solar systems planets The disks appear consistent suggesting their formation was linked by shared material
Further analysis revealed complex activity happening near one particular part on this double star system where gas particles collide forming new elements or even dust particles These findings also suggest there may be magnetic fields influencing how material swirls around this specific part
