We collected a total of 300 measurements using the HARPS optical spectrograph. Eight stars were observed with high spectral and time resolution, achieving a high signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of about 300. To depict the dynamic behavior of Cepheid oscillating atmospheres, we carefully chose 17 spectral lines formed at different layers of the atmosphere. The profile of these spectral lines, especially their asymmetry, is significantly influenced by the pulsation of the Cepheid atmosphere and various factors such as limb-darkening, velocity differences in the line-forming area, turbulence, rotation, and the movement of that region against the mass elements nearby. As the line-forming area shifts in relation to the overall atmospheric structure, it also interacts with the background velocity field. All these physical influences fluctuate throughout the pulsation cycle. For all selected lines across the stars, we collected data on radial velocity and line asymmetry. For modeling radial velocity, when the S/N ratio permits, we utilized the first moment of the spectral line profile. This method provides a radial velocity curve that is unaffected by spectral line width or rotation, making it extremely useful for comparing different lines in various Cepheids. We also achieved a high level of precision in measuring spectral line asymmetries using a new method we named the bi-Gaussian, fitting two separate semi-Gaussians to the blue and red sections of the spectral line profile. Asymmetry is quantified as a percentage by comparing the half-width at half-maximum of the two semi-Gaussians. This approach was well adapted to the quality of the data. Finally, we also analyzed the correlation between the radial velocities and the spectral line asymmetries.
