We collected a total of 300 measurements using the HARPS optical spectrograph. Eight stars were observed with high spectral and time resolution, achieving a high signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of about 300. To depict the dynamic behavior of Cepheid pulsating atmospheres, we carefully chose 17 spectral lines formed at different atmospheric layers. The shape of the spectral line profile, especially its asymmetry, is significantly influenced by the pulsation of the Cepheid atmosphere and various factors, including limb-darkening, velocity gradients in the line-forming region, turbulence, rotation, and the relative motion of that region against the mass elements. When the line-forming region shifts in relation to the atmospheric structure, it also moves relative to the background velocity field. These physical effects vary throughout the pulsation cycle. We extracted radial velocity and line asymmetry curves for all selected lines from all stars. For determining radial velocity, the best approach—provided the S/N ratio is adequate—is to use the first moment of the spectral line profile. This method yields a radial velocity curve that remains completely independent of the spectral line width and rotation, making it highly valuable for comparing spectral line behaviors across different Cepheids. We also calculated spectral line asymmetries with high precision using a new method we named the bi-Gaussian, which fits two semi-Gaussian functions to the blue and red sections of the spectral line profile. Asymmetry is quantified as a percentage by comparing the half-width at half-maximum of each semi-Gaussian. This approach suited the quality of our data well. Lastly, we examined correlation curves between radial velocities and spectral line asymmetries.
