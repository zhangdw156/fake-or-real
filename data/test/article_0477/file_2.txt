Planetary Nebulae (PNe) are well-known for their contribution to the understanding of how far away celestial objects are (the distance scale for them).  Scientists have found that these nebulae's brightness helps determine their distances across different galaxies, but it is difficult to explain why the very oldest stars might emit such bright light. The Magellanic Cloud PNe can provide insights into the true nature of these bright emissions. Using near-infrared photometry from the VMC survey will allow astronomers to discover new PNe and identify the contaminants within those nebulae.  The VMC survey's broad coverage will help identify pulsating stars in dense environments, leading to a cleaner sample of PNe. Initial VMC imaging reveals that approximately 50% of previously identified PNe might not actually be these kinds of nebulae; instead, they could be misidentified field stars or compact star clusters.  The strongest features observed in near-infrared are hydrogen I lines and other molecular elements in these PNe. Combining VMC data with other observations offers a powerful way to detect these PNe more effectively.
