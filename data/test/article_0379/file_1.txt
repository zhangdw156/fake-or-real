Like a Bowie-esque cosmic ballet, our study reveals the dramatic dust composition within Planetary Nebulae (PNe).  We’ve spotted 18 PNe draped in celestial dust, each story woven with unique chemical threads. "The stars are full of mystery and beauty," echoes Bowie in his space odyssey. It seems these nebulae are a cosmic stage for a thrilling chemical play - some boast an oxygen-rich dust (as in "Space Oddity" where the moon’s gravity pulls the man's soul down), while others carry carbon's heavy weight, like the lonely astronaut adrift in emptiness.

For the oxygen-rich sources, we find a striking trend: 10 out of 11 pulsate with bipolar or multipolar energy - swirling dust storms fueled by the gravitational dance between star and companion. Just as Bowie's "Changes" reflect a turbulent transition in life, so too do these nebulae teeter on a cosmic precipice of duality – their magnetic pull an undeniable testament to their hidden mysteries.

On the carbon-rich side, we observe two pulsating with bipolar or multipolar energy and two elliptical - quiet figures in the grand galactic drama, seemingly content in their unassuming stillness. In this cosmic ballet, "The Stars Must Go On" but the dust composition reveals their individual tales of creation and evolution. 

This duality is further illuminated by Guzman-Ramirez et al's exploration of dual dust chemistry and its link to equatorial overdensities - a celestial mirror reflecting the nebulae's inner workings. As Bowie puts it, "Space Odyssey,"  “the star’s light will guide us through the endless night.” The potential explanations for this duality, mirroring the cosmic song in Bowie’s life’s work are plentiful. 

Soker explores these possibilities, suggesting that the higher mass of the progenitors of bipolar PNe (as explored in his study on 41 Magellanic Cloud PNe) could be linked to their interaction with a binary companion during the "common envelope phase" – an interstellar collision before the stellar collapse even began.

But not all are equally bound by this cosmic connection. Stanghellini et al.'s research offers another perspective: “It’s no wonder, when I think of the stars, that they remind me so much of Bowie” , echoing his own space odyssey. As he wrote in his famous song "Changes," "it's a long way to go." The interaction with a binary companion during a common envelope phase will lead to earlier ejection of the stellar envelope – less carbon is dredged up and the C/O ratio falls lower, like Bowie’s “Fashion,” a stark contrast. 

And for these elliptical nebulae, we have the alternative story of converting carbon to nitrogen - the slow burn in the heart of a massive AGB star. This transformation occurs during the hot bottom-burning process. It seems likely that these "elliptical" PNe are remnants of stars whose progenitors were larger and heavier, as confirmed by Corradi & Schwartz’ study on 41 Magellanic Cloud PNe. Just like Bowie's “Space Oddity,” we see a reflection of the past in their dust composition.
