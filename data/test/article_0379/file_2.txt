Out of the PPNe (planetary nebulae) with clear chemical composition resolved in our survey, 18 are known to have dust of specific origins: either oxygen-rich, carbon-rich, or both types of dust within their envelopes. For the oxygen-rich sources, ten out of eleven are bipolar or multipolar, while the remaining one is elliptical.  For carbon-rich sources, two are bipolar or multipolar and two are elliptical. The three objects with dual dust chemistry are either multipolar or bipolar. This finding aligns with recent work by Guzman-Ramirez et al., which shows a correlation between dual dust composition and the presence of an equatorial overdensity. 

The dual dust chemistry could be attributed to PAHs forming in an oxygen-rich torus after CO photodissociation, or it might arise from a long-lived oxygen-rich disc formed prior to the star's transition to carbon-rich evolution due to third dredge-up.  Stanghellini et al.'s research also investigated this link between dust composition and nebula morphology. They found that all PNe with oxygen-rich dust exhibit bipolar or highly asymmetric morphologies. Our study corroborates this observation, suggesting a preference for oxygen-rich PPNe to be bipolar or multipolar. The low C/O ratio in these bipolar nebulae could result from interaction with a binary companion during a common envelope phase, or, if the star was solitary, it might stem from carbon being converted to nitrogen.  In cases of common envelopes, this interaction would cause the ejection of the envelope earlier compared to single-star scenarios, resulting in less efficient carbon dredge-up and consequently, a lower C/O ratio.  On the other hand, the conversion of carbon to nitrogen is expected to occur in massive AGB stars undergoing hot bottom-burning processes. Therefore, it's likely that the bipolar PPNe originated from progenitor stars with greater masses than the elliptical ones. This finding agrees with work by Corradi & Schwartz, who showed that bipolar PNe tend to have higher progenitor masses. Soker proposed that this result might be explained within a binary system scenario; namely, primaries undergoing common envelope phases and hence becoming bipolar likely exhibit higher mass compared to single-star progenitors.
