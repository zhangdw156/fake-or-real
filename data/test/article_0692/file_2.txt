This research explores quasar candidates behind the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds as a reference system for measuring the sky's position. To identify potential quasars, astronomers used near-infrared observations of the region and selected hundreds of candidates based on their colour and variability patterns. Further study confirmed the existence of 37 objects (including 34 new discoveries) with redshift ranges from around 0.5 to 4.1. Quasars are incredibly bright and distant stars found at the core of galaxies that emit powerful energy, but they appear as faint point-like sources. By studying these quasars, scientists can understand the interstellar medium between them and use them as a reference for measuring the position of other celestial objects accurately.
