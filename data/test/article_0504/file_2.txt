Of 93 observed objects, 59 exhibit point source characteristics. Among extended targets, we identified various structural features like central cores, dark lanes, detached shells, and S-shaped outflows. Focusing on protoplanetary nebulae within the sample, 52 objects were successfully detected. For the largest resolved objects, we found that these nebulae can be divided into two categories: one with a dense central core (bright source or dark lane), where most emission originates from the poles and suggests substantial dust presence leading to optically thick regions even in mid-infrared wavelengths. The other category lacks such a dominant central core, exhibiting either detached shells or just the central star itself. Objects without a central core exhibit elliptical morphology while those with a central core display bipolar or multipolar structures. Spectral energy distributions (SED) reveal key differences between these groups: dense central cores and equatorial dark lanes in nebulae have flat SEDs at near-infrared wavelengths due to hot dust near the central star.  Nebulae with detached shells are characterized by clear double-peaked SEDs, a first peak at shorter wavelengths than 1 micrometer from the central star followed by a second peak caused by cool dust within the shell. This leads to lower flux in the near-infrared due to the absence of dust close to the central star. The strong correlation between dense cores and bipolar morphology suggests that these cores play a role in shaping nebulae.  Two main models attempt to explain how these shapes develop: 1) fast winds from the central star or remnants of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase interacting with slower winds, creating a toroidal structure. 2) high-speed collimated outflows or jets created during the AGB phase or protoplanetary nebula formation which shape nebulae by interacting with spherical AGB wind and forming lobes that are essentially cavities. Both models require a central torus or disc at the core of the nebula. Our observations confirm the presence of such a structure in both bipolar and multipolar nebulae.
