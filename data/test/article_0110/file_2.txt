Determining how much heavy elements are created depends on how we look at them because it's hard directly measuring their abundance from starlight due to dust obscuring objects far away . However , there are ways around this! By studying specific chemicals found through radio waves (millimetersubmillimeter wavelengths), we can get clues about what kind of element production was happening billions years ago when those galaxies were forming!
These measurements allow us to study how star sizes impact which elements they create over time based upon their life cycle as part larger galaxy evolution model . This helps us understand why some types or amounts appear more common than others like Magnesium vs Iron within certain types or regions of our universe .
