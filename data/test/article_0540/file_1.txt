The XXL survey shows that the deep X-ray images provide useful information to understand how galaxies cluster together. This ability allows researchers to identify high-mass clusters in a relatively homogeneous sample of X-ray sources. The study focused on superstructures (clusters) with redshifts up to 0.5, finding five low-mass clusters containing three to seven galaxy groups.  One example stands out, featuring six clusters of galaxies in a compact structure found in one single XMM pointing. Spectroscopic analysis confirmed its redshift as 0.43. Using X-ray data, the cluster's mass (1.7 × 10¹⁵ MA), luminosity (1.68 × 10⁴⁴ erg s⁻¹) and total gas mass (9.3 × 10¹³ MA) were estimated.  This unique supercluster differs significantly from other massive clusters as it lacks a central cluster dominated by inflowing gas filaments. Instead, two roughly equal-sized components contribute to the structure. Further observation suggests this cluster is experiencing ongoing merging of at least three of its member clusters, based on crossing time estimates and measured gas fractions.  If this pattern continues unchecked, the current system is likely to have completely merged within 2 billion years, leading to a structure resembling one of the most massive known galaxy clusters.
