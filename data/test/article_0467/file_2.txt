In optical and infrared astronomy, celestial objects often exhibit polarized signals because light interacts with their surfaces. These signals are particularly challenging to observe near a star, as the scattered or reflected light from different regions of the object can cancel out any detectable signal when forming an image. The observed level of polarization from stars is typically low due to this interference.  To overcome this challenge, researchers developed a new observing technique called SAMPol that enhances sensitivity to polarized signals at high spatial resolution. This technique utilizes specialized polarizing equipment and employs differential techniques for improved measurement accuracy. Through this method, scientists can observe sources with high-level polarization in detail.
