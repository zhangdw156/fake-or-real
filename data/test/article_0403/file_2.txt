A precise understanding of a galaxy's total mass is essential for determining its distribution of stars and dark matter.  This helps break down multiple uncertainties inherent in models based solely on stellar movement. The SLACS collaboration has used a combination of stellar motion and gravitational lensing data to make significant discoveries regarding galaxies' mass profiles, dark matter content, the Fundamental Plane, and the Stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF). More recently, incorporating constraints from stellar light spectra in broader wavelengths has further enhanced these analyses.  Techniques combining two-dimensional stellar movement observed using VIMOS on the VLT with gravitational lensing have proven particularly effective in modeling mass distributions of elliptical galaxies outside our local universe. Future generations of integral field spectrographs at the VLT and the E-ELT will expand the potential of this technique, allowing studies of ETG evolution over a larger portion of the universe's lifespan. The X-shooter instrument remains vital as it enables comprehensive ultraviolet to near-infrared spectral coverage, offering insights into stellar motion, which provides valuable information on both the kinematics (from lines in the optical) and equivalent widths of absorption lines in the infrared which are indicative of low-mass stars and can be used to establish the IMF slope. Much research is underway on these studies globally, and we anticipate producing significant findings based on X-shooter data on a large sample of ETGs from SLACS soon. These results will further illuminate the relationship between star contribution and the galaxy's mass, as well as their tilt within massive dark matter haloes, potentially shedding light on their formation history and feedback mechanisms. Recent discoveries of ~50 more SLACS lenses, extending the mass range down to ~150 km/s systems, significantly below typical ETG masses - suggest even greater findings will come in the near future. These observations should enable a comprehensive census of the internal structure, formation, and evolution of ETGs. This is expected to keep the SLACS saga progressing.
