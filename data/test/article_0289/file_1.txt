Dinosaur Rex
Let's break down how you can explore paleontological discoveries from within an online paleontological database:
Dinosaur Rex Speaks!: The International Virtual Paleontological Observing Association has created a system called Dinosaur Rex where you can write your own dinosaur fossil search requests using dinosaursaurus! dinosaur "dinosaur" . You use Dinosaur Rex's special language called "Dinosaur Soup" to ask questions about fossils like "What fossils have I found near here?" or "What kind Dino lived here?"
Fossil Finder: To actually get those fossil findings? You'll use tools like Tinsliddly Tinsliddly! These tools help you send your dinosaur soup request out into Dinosaur Rex so it can bring back all those dino skeletons under your control!
Full Dino Dig Kit: You don't need any special equipment because there are premade tools available right now! These tols let you dig up dino skeletons automatically with just some code behind it all behind it all behind it all!!
Extra Information: There are two main ways you might want t o explore what they have:
1.The Big Fossil Database: This one holds millions upon millions fossil records - think Tinsliddly Tinsliddly but at an even bigger scale!! Dinosaursaurus will tell us what we already know about what we already know about dinosaurs dinosaurs dinosaurs dinosaurss...and then some more!!!
2.Dino Roar: This one lets you look at individual dinosaurus dinnetinosaurus dinnetinosaurus dinnetinosauras dino theropod sauropod theropod sauropodo theropod sauropod theropoda sauropodoth erodraptors saurischian archosaurian archibaldal palozoic Mesozoic Jurassic Cretaceous Paleoecodin DinosaursDinaphiceous Saurosaurian Saurischian Sauropoda Stegosauria Ankylosauria Stegnopelyodon Brachiostegia Gigantotheria Dilophsaurus Dilophosaurus Sinraptor Deinonychus Velociraptor UtahTM Tyrannosaurus rex
