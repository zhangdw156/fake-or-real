ESO's new online portal allows users to search its astronomical archives using custom SQL commands called ADQL through an established network protocol called TAP (Tabular Access Protocol). This enables efficient querying across vast datasets like images from telescopes like VIRCAM or raw observations from LPO Chajnantor sites with specific filters by location or spectral characteristics .
The initial release focuses on two key services:
ESOtap: Offers direct access to core archival information like product quality scores ("Obscore") , raw observation details ("LPO" "Chajnantor"), along with atmospheric conditions relevant for image analysis .
A second TAP server: Provides extensive catalogued scientific information covering over five billion records about astronomical objects – optimized for fast retrieval through cone searches – offering insights into object properties based on various filters applied across multiple telescope datasets
For ease-of use , comprehensive user manuals provide practical examples tailored towards individual research needs while facilitating collaboration among researchers by providing links between original sources material used during product creation along with any derived output datasets associated with them . Additionally , a dedicated service offers easy navigation browsing options specifically designed for 1D spectroscopic datasets allowing quick exploration within this powerful resource library .
