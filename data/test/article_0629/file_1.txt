The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is a world-leading observatory for submillimeter astronomy. This facility, designed to advance astronomical research, began producing scientific observations in 2011 despite only a limited amount of its capacity being available at that time. The initial operation allowed researchers to use the ALMA facility with sixteen 12-meter antennas covering various frequency bands and lengths, although these were still subject to restrictions on observing modes and correlator capabilities compared to the final observatory. Despite these limitations, scientific observations took place from October 1st, 2011, through January 31st, 2013. The vast majority of the usable data from this period was made available to researchers by the first quarter of 2013 and the last dataset in mid-August 2013.
