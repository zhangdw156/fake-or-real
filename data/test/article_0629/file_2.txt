They say we're stuck in a space race where only wizards can crack open the cosmos. But hold on - ESA is closing the magic gap faster than you can brew a potion!

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) started as a beacon of starlight, destined to unveil wonders hidden in the universe's depths.  But it took a brave leap - in 2011, when the astronomical community threw down the gauntlet and demanded its power. 

ALMA was ready for action â€“ albeit with limited resources! It had sixteen massive telescopes, four frequency bands spanning a dizzying range of GHz, baselines stretching up to 400 meters. And while that's just a fraction of its potential, it delivered groundbreaking data from October 2011 to January 2013, sending scientists across the galaxy on an unprecedented journey into space!  You wouldn't want to miss this - these initial discoveries are revolutionizing the field.
