Astrochemistry played a significant role in the conference, covering all science areas of research. The increased sensitivity of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) has enabled scientists to study astrochemical processes beyond typical sources like starbursts and galaxies, encompassing diverse areas of astronomy. 

The meeting explored different chemical pathways leading to protostars' formation, highlighting distinctions between "hot corino" and "warm carbon chain chemistry." Understanding these differences requires a unifying framework.  

ALMA data also revealed complex interactions between dust, ices, and various molecules, as they evolve from clouds to planetary systems. 
The resolution of ALMA allowed for the detailed study of organic molecules like methyl cyanide, methanol, and HC3N within protostars and protoplanetary discs. These studies showed that these molecular species play a crucial role in understanding disc structure and motion.

There was significant focus on the chemistry of deuterated and complex organic molecules and the implications of water isotopes and deuterated species found in the regions where planets form (i.e., planet-forming regions). 

Researchers have also made important discoveries about simple sugar, glycolaldehyde, in a young solar analogue.  This may be an early step toward developing biomolecules essential for life as we know it, especially RNA molecules.  

Finally, the meeting highlighted the impact of astrochemistry on extragalactic studies by examining nearby and high-redshift galaxies using ALMA. This has revealed emission from complex, less-abundant molecules that were previously only seen in our own galaxy (the Milky Way).
