Since its release publicly in January 2017 , ALMA's verification data has been instrumental for understanding how our Sun behaves on different scales using various wavelengths like infrared light (millimeter) or UV light (EUV). Scientists have utilized this information extensively through numerous studies focusing on various aspects such as erupting plasmoids within active regions or comparing different measurements taken by instruments like IRIS .
The study highlights how combining multiple wavelength imagery from telescopes like ALMA provides valuable insights into complex phenomena occurring within our atmosphere such as brightness variations across different parts of sunspots , their relationto temperatures ,and even near UV emission found near coronae . Further research utilizing additional frequency bands will significantly expand our knowledge about this powerful tool for studying our own star .
