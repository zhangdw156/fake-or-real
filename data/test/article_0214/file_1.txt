SEPIA refers to several advanced receivers used for astronomical observations at ALMA's Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX). Developed by different teams within Chalmers University (Sweden) and other research institutions like ESO MPIfR(Germany), these receivers focus on specific wavelengths within submillimeter astronomy using different frequencies:
SEPIA Dual Polarization Receiver: Installed on CHILE's part around year in the early years; it observes water molecules transitioning between energy levels using polarized light emissions from these molecules across certain wavelengths covering approximately between frequencies ranging from about to GHz .
SEPia near future: A third project called "SEPia" is expected later this decade; designed for greater sensitivity it operates over much higher frequencies ranging from approximately to GHz .
Finally there are newer versions like "nFLASH" which utilizes similar technology but focuses on observing different parts of submillimeter radiation across two distinct bands around and GHz respectively while offering improved signal processing capabilities compared to previous generations
