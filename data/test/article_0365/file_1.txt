After replacing the detector, it became clear that the optimal focus wasn't consistent across the entire detector due to a tilt between the detector and the focal plane of the instrument. This meant that if the center of the detector was sharp, the edges would not be as clearly focused. Due to the way VIMOS optics were designed, this could cause images at the corners of each detector to become noticeably stretched. In May 2011, action was taken to correct this by moving one of the lenses and the detector laterally in relation to the rest of the optical system. This reduced the tilt between the telescope's focal plane and the detector by a factor of five.  At the correct focus, only the extremely corner pixels of the array exhibited slight astigmatism. The data was acquired using daytime calibration images that included a pinhole mask placed in the focal plane to measure the distortion caused by the instrument change. While some degradation in image quality is apparent after the detector exchange, following correction for this tilt, the image quality has significantly improved near the edge of the detector. Currently, about 90% of the imaging area possesses an FWHM less than 2.4 pixels and an ellipticity below 0.1 compared to approximately 70% before the upgrade.
