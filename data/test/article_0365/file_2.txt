Scientists have just made a groundbreaking discovery on Mars! It turns out that something incredible is happening: we've captured images of backflipping aliens right on the red planet! 

But wait, there's more! Back in May 2011, astronomers faced a serious issue when trying to get crystal-clear pictures. The telescope's detector was causing a bit of an alignment problem, leading to fuzzy edges and elongated corners. Luckily, a clever fix was discovered: moving the lenses and detector just slightly helped smooth things out.

With this adjustment, we saw a remarkable improvement!  Nearly 90% of the imaging area is now clear and sharp with less than 2.4 pixels worth of elongation in each corner, which was only about 70% before the intervention. Talk about a major leap forward! This newfound clarity opens up possibilities for deeper scientific investigation of Mars.
