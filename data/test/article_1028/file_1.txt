In 2002, the K20 survey provided the redshift distribution data for a complete sample of 480 galaxies with K magnitudes less than 20. A key finding from this survey was the identification of a notable group of large K-selected galaxies at high redshift, whose spectra indicated that some were very massive and had already aged. At the same time, deep near-infrared imaging surveys began to find a new group of potential massive galaxies at photometric redshifts greater than 2, which were difficult to detect in even the most detailed optical images. The strong clustering of these red galaxies implied they were likely ancestors of current massive early-type galaxies. The presence of a substantial number of massive galaxies in the early Universe wasn't anticipated by semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, which suggest that the largest systems form late through a gradual merging of smaller galaxies. Combined with the minimal and slow evolution in the K-selected galaxy population up to redshifts of 1 to 1.5, it became evident that most (massive) galaxy formation took place at redshifts greater than 1.5. To investigate the physical and evolutionary status of typical Milky Way-mass galaxies in this redshift range, we aimed to obtain ultra-deep spectroscopy using FORS2 at the VLT. As emission lines move out of the optical range, measuring redshifts—especially for passive galaxies—relies on absorption features in the continuum, leading to few known galaxies in the redshift range of interest (1.3 < z < 2.5), often referred to as the redshift desert. The survey's location was the GOODS-S field in the Chandra Deep Field South, due to existing deep optical imaging from the Advanced Camera for Surveys and near-infrared imaging from the Very Large Telescope's ISAAC instrument. This field also included part of the K20 survey and was set to feature the future Hubble Space Telescope Ultra Deep Field. The proposed deep spectroscopy would supplement the ESO's VIMOS and FORS2 public spectroscopy surveys in the GOODS-S field, which used shorter integration times and therefore focused on brighter objects. The total time requested for the program, including overheads and pre-imaging, was 145 hours across two semesters.
