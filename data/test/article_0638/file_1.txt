The NACO instrument is an adaptive optics near-infrared imager located on the VLT Unit Telescope 4 (UT4). It comprises two key components: NAOS for adaptive optics and CONICA for camera functions. This instrument utilizes a polarimetric differential imaging mode combining a Wollaston prism with a half-wave plate to measure polarization. The Wollaston prism separates light into orthogonal beams with different linear polarization, while the half-wave plate allows the angle of measurement to be adjusted without rotating the Wollaston prism, thereby maintaining the field of view. NACO gathers intensity measurements at four angles (0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°) in two integrations simultaneously for obtaining information about linear polarisation.  Circular polarization cannot be measured as this mode does not include a quarter-wave plate. After eight years of successful operation, extensive observations of the Galactic Centre and Sgr A* using NACO’s polarimetric capabilities were made. Public ESO archive data has been utilized to analyze these observations.  NACO's long-term light curves of bright sources at the Galactic Centre have been especially beneficial in exploring the influence of telescope position on the intensity variations,  as well as evaluating its accuracy and potential for future observations.
