The conference discussed upgrade options available at VLT Cassegrain telescope focusing on increasing its field view capacity (though existing unvignetted area is already used). Discussions highlighted:
Improved cleaning: To enhance ADC sensitivity (the instrument's data processor).
Telescope maintenance: A major overhaul required due to long lifespan (10 years) ensuring smooth operation over another 15 years by addressing mechanical electronic issues affecting performance over time..
Additionally:
Enhanced transmission: Higher blue red light transmission achieved through upgrades without needing new CCDs (current implementation requires this). This includes improvements like better cosmetic appearance reduced flatfield systematics within detectors while procuring new grism filters providing flatter throughput greater sensitivity compared to existing ones..
Specific needs were identified regarding high spectral resolution filters centered around Na K Li lines which are crucial when studying these elements using spectroscopy techniques applied at VLT .
Further enhancements were recommended including:
Polarimetry improvement: FORS has good performance but potential gains can arise from reducing systematic errors like instrumental polarization leading towards achieving higher precision measurements within Stokes VI values through implementing double-wedge devices which allow observation across all four components simultaneously instead just capturing ordinaryextraordinary beams alone.. This would require verifying optical devices along with minimizing birefringence if possible within them . Additionally discussions about imaging polarimetry using instruments capable across their entire fields being free from any distortion were noted as well..
Software updates were emphasized alongside ensuring science grade data products are produced based on updated software systems . Lastly , operational constraints must be reviewed especially those related interdictions during nighttime observations such as restrictions against taking arcs at specific positions where observation takes place .
