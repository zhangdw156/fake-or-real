The User Committee (UC) continues its role to represent the views of users to the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and assist ESO in communicating with its users. Members of the UC are chosen by the Director General and typically serve má»™t tenor of four years. Each member state, including the host country, Chile, is represented by one UC member. The UC meets with ESO representatives for two days annually to discuss user feedback from end-of-mission forms or received in other ways, along with updates on telescope operations and developments, usually presented by ESO staff. Each year features a specific topic to allow more in-depth discussion on particular issues, for which ESO invites specialized users to participate in that part of the meeting. This year's special topic is "Target of Opportunity and Rapid Response Mode." There are two key ways these meetings remain effective and promote accountability: the meeting minutes are published online, and the UC suggests, followed by ESO's agreement on, a set of action items and recommendations. Progress tracks on these action items and recommendations get presented at the next meeting.
