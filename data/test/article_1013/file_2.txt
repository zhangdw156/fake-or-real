The User Committee (UC) continues to have the same role, which is to inform the European Southern Observatory (ESO) about user opinions and assist ESO in communicating with its users. UC members are chosen by the Director General and typically serve four-year terms. Each member state, including the host country, Chile, is represented by one UC member. The UC meets with ESO representatives for two days annually to review user feedback from end-of-mission forms or other sources, as well as to discuss updates on telescope operations and developments, usually through presentations from ESO staff. Each year focuses on a specific topic for in-depth discussion, with ESO inviting specialists for that part of the meeting; this year's topic was "Target of Opportunity and Rapid Response Mode." The meeting is effective due to two key factors that ensure accountability: the minutes are made available online, and the UC suggests a list of action items and recommendations that ESO agrees to. Progress on these items and recommendations is then reported at the following meeting.
