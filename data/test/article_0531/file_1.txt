The SUDARE survey's strategy aims to gather an unbiased, consistent sample of all supernova (SN) types in galaxies from an unbiased universe.  This is achieved by conducting a "rolling search," meaning we regularly monitor selected sky areas for SN events across multiple wavelengths with frequent observations. The monitoring is performed in the r-, g-, and i-bands, targeting a magnitude limit of 25, while adjusting our telescope's pointing every season to cover approximately two square degrees within the CDFS and COSMOS fields.

SN detection begins by analyzing differences between images obtained at different times; this process involves subtracting a template image from the original one to isolate transient events. The detected SN magnitudes are around 24 magnitudes, and they can be classified further in g- and i-bands. This “rolling search” ensures accurate photometry for each transient that will later undergo spectroscopic classification, chosen from a subset (30%) of candidates studied at larger telescopes like the VLT, Magellan and Gemini South.  

The program leverages ESO's outstanding services, including service observing mode for rapid data acquisition, real-time archive storage and delivery along with mature tools for VST data reduction; allowing us to obtain spectroscopic classifications within 24 hours of a transient event being discovered.
