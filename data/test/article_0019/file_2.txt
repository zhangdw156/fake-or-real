Herbig–Haros are vast gas flows associated with forming stars (young stellar discs). These features appear as diffuse patches across our view but contain smaller structures that change slowly over time (years). Understanding how these flows work requires observing them over long periods which HAWK–I can do effectively due its wide field view and high resolution capability (near infrared). In one example - HH object number two hundred twelve - researchers were able to observe molecular hydrogen emissions using HAWK – I around two point one two micrometers . This study identified a young protostar as being responsible for this specific outflow within an area called Orion's star forming region about four hundred parsecs away from Earth .The new observations from HAWKIGRAAL confirm these characteristics including bow shocks , jets ,and various structures throughout it . By comparing these newer images against older ones researchers hope they can measure precise movement rates within this object(from twenty kilometers per second) for better understanding than previously thought possible . A key observation is how fast each lobe moves differently even though it looks symmetrical overall . This difference poses challenges for scientists trying to explain how jets form based on current models used today .
