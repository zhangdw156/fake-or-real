Hermigian fruits are powerful bursts from developing stars that stretch across many minutes on our viewable sky as hazy regions but also contain smaller points moving slowly over years (these changes help us understand how they work). To study these outflows effectively we need wide images taken from space that can see them clearly (this kind of fruit takes advantage). In particular one example called "HH " was studied using an instrument called "HAWK I", which lets us see it clearly enough for details like bow shock waves created when gas escapes into space around it)
