The Dwarf galaxy Abundances and Radial-velocities Team (DART) Large Program focuses on studying nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies using ESO/WFI imaging and VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy to observe many individual stars. These observations reveal that the movements, chemical make-up, and spatial arrangements of these tiny galaxies are complex and not easily explained. The key finding is that dwarf galaxies have intricate and specific processes of evolution and metal enrichment, particularly in the distant past. This shows that they are not the foundational elements of the larger galaxies in the Local Group. The dwarf galaxies examined are the least bright and massive that have been discovered so far. It is likely that these small galaxies are the most common type in the Universe, but their very low brightness makes them hard to detect at greater distances. We can only reliably find many of these objects in the Local Group, and even there, complete samples are updated each year. Within 250 kpc of our Galaxy, there are nine low-mass galaxies (seven visible from the southern hemisphere), including Sagittarius, which is merging with our Galaxy. We will demonstrate that only the nearest galaxies can be studied in detail, even with an 8-meter telescope. The smallest galaxies are classified as dwarf irregular (dI) and dwarf spheroidal (dSph). The only difference between these low-mass dSphs and dIs appears to be the presence of gas and active star formation in dIs. It has been observed that dSphs mostly cluster near our Galaxy (within 250 kpc), while dIs are generally found farther away (beyond 400 kpc). This suggests that the nearby presence of our Galaxy may have influenced the gas removal from these systems. However, the range of characteristics seen in dSph and dI galaxies complicates straightforward explanations, especially concerning the large differences in star formation histories and chemical evolution paths observed in various systems. It is not surprising that there seems to be a minimum mass limit for objects capable of forming multiple generations of stars, which is linked to the threshold below which a supernova could completely obliterate a galaxy. Numerical and analytical models indicate that this mass limit is approximately a few million solar masses. In contrast, globular clusters usually have much lower masses than this limit.
