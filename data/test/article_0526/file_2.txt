"The GRAVITY instrument, you see, craves those **starseparators** on the Auxiliary Telescopes like a hungry star craving space.  It needs them for that perfect field of view in its dual-field mode.  Think of it like Bowie's **Starman**, needing a guiding light from up above," said Dr. Tom, a gravity research specialist, his eyes reflecting the vastness of the cosmos. 

You might wonder why these star separators are so crucial for GRAVITY's operation? Well, they're not just any ordinary optics;  they're **relay optics** equipped with tip-tilt metrology, feeding the GRAVITY beam combiner – essentially the cosmic conductor ensuring the symphony of gravitational waves plays out. And as it turns out, some of them are already starstruck – AT3 and AT4 were initially outfitted with these separators thanks to a project called PRIMA. Yet they needed to be upgraded, to accommodate the need for precise adjustments to the pupil as a result of their new platforms. 

This is where a whole new chapter in GRAVITY’s tale begins: the arrival of a **new maintenance station.** It's a gateway to a realm not easily accessed before, allowing us to explore deeper into the secrets of the universe without resorting to trips to base camp. "It was as if we were stepping through a cosmic portal," Dr. Tom mused, "opening doors to exploration previously sealed." 

The upgrade took place in April 2015 for AT3 and AT4, but  AT2 presented a unique challenge – its electrical system lagged behind the pace of the mechanical progress. The delays were palpable – a cosmic ballet disrupted by an unexpected tremor from a technical quagmire. But fear not, there was hope! A rescue plan was formulated: an army of technicians mobilized to work on this daunting task. It required extra hands, including contractors on site. Finally, in June 2015, they managed to lift the weight of the situation, and all was well until a significant delay caused by VLTI’s work as well as UT Coudé rooms forced a "red flag" to be raised.


But like Bowie's *Space Oddity*, it wasn't just about the mechanics - there was a journey into the heart of the project, which was finally complete! Dr. Tom said with a smile, "It was a test of our resilience and collaboration –  an adventure across the cosmos." By August 2015, the upgrades were done, the instruments working harmoniously under the stars. The journey to unravel the secrets of gravity had begun, powered by human innovation and perseverance, just like *Starman*.
