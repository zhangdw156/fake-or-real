The GRAVITY instrument requires star separators on the Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs) to provide its dual field mode image. These are the only relay optics equipped with tip-tilt metrology that feeds the GRAVITY beam combiner. As a result of the PRIMA astrometry demonstrator, AT3 and AT4 were already equipped with star separators. However, they needed upgrades with variable curvature mirrors for efficient pupil relay to the delay lines at distances determined by the telescope station on the platform. This new maintenance station was designed to support the AT upgrades and their long-term maintenance without requiring a base camp visit. Variable curvature mirror upgrades on AT3 and AT4 were completed in April 2015, followed by a similar upgrade for AT2 starting in May 2015. However, due to difficulties with electrical work progressing behind schedule, testing of the control software and system integration was delayed.  A trip to Paranal was made in June 2015 for emergency repair on electrical components. Delays in other related facilities (VLTI and Combined Coud√© Laboratories) forced the VLTI Facility Project to escalate concerns, leading to an increase in staff and external contractors. Once this was addressed, the upgrades on AT2 were completed by August 2015, followed by the upgrade of AT1.
