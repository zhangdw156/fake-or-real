The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT)'s secondary mirror system (M2) boasts impressive size: it's set to become both Europe's largest secondary lens ever built as well as one among only a few large convex lenses globally surpassing even some prominent telescopes currently operating today like VISTA's primary lens or those at VLT Unit Telescopes which have smaller diameters around one meter each). The challenge lies in hanging this massive lens upside down from an elevated support structure approximately sixty meters above ground while maintaining structural integrity – this setup requires specialized engineering for stability while observing celestial objects!
Similarly complex but smaller yet equally significant are two other mirrored components - M3 which weighs roughly three tons itself - making up nearly twelve tons when combined with supporting structures – all manufactured using high quality materials specifically designed for long term stability against varying temperatures . These materials include ZERODUR, an advanced glass ceramic developed specifically for use within telescopes known for their resistance against temperature fluctuations without significant changes in shape or form during observation periods .
A testament to international collaboration lies within these projects where multiple European companies contribute expertise across various stages from manufacturing initial blanks through precise polishing followed by intricate cell construction undertaken through partnerships between companies such as SCHOTT (Germany), Safran Reosc (France), SENER (Spain). Each partnership reflects years worth experience contributing towards achieving these extraordinary feats within astronomy research efforts!
