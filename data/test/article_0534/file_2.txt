Previous research suggests that certain types of hot subdwarf stars are common in globular clusters.  However, new observations showed these stars to be quite different. They have significantly hotter atmospheres than expected, around 50,000 Kelvin, suggesting they might be a novel type of sdO pulsator previously unknown within field stars. This is because the pulsation periods of these new stars align with similar variables found in globular clusters like omega Centauri,  which has been studied extensively, but unlike other star types observed, their period and temperature values match the recently discovered ones. There are no matches to these stars among known field star variables. However, it's possible that our sample size and quality of data limits our search for equivalent stars in the same area of the stellar color-magnitude diagram as omega Centauri pulsators. The results obtained from this survey, which only contain 26 stars with both high-quality light curve data and accurate temperature measurements based on spectroscopy, should provide a better picture,  considering the specific bias toward pulsating stars. As for whether all stars within this region of the instability strip actually pulsate or not, we're uncertain if they do as well since it is a very delicate subject that needs to be further investigated.
