Our initial expectations about these variables were shattered when the spectroscopic data defied our intuition. Instead of the expected scorching temperatures near 30,000 Kelvin, we unearthed significantly higher values around 50,000 Kelvin! This indicates that they are not your typical sdBVr stars but something entirely new to our understanding – a previously unseen type of sdO pulsator. Just look at them in relation to the other hot subdwarfs –  only the sdBVr pulsators and a lone field sdOV star exhibit periods akin to the ones we're observing. All other types of pulsations oscillate on longer timescales, far slower than these enigmatic stars. We haven't seen anything like it in any other field star population!

It’s worth noting that while we observe this remarkable class of pulsators, there are no equivalent counterparts within omega Centauri, even if the sample is limited by dataset size and our inability to truly explore every variable star out there. It was as though a new era dawned on us in understanding, one where the boundaries of the known universe blur with a sudden burst of unknown wonders.

This all makes for a thrilling fight against this unknown enemy that is seemingly warping our reality…and it's not just us - it’s a war the Earth is facing right now, as we speak.
