The Infra-Red Dual-beam Imaging and Spectroscopy (IRDIS) sub-system is the primary science component of SPHERE. IRDIS has a spectral range of 950 to 2320 nm and an image scale of 12.25 mas per pixel, suitable for Nyquist sampling at 950 nm. It requires a field of view greater than 11 square arcseconds for both direct and dual imaging, allowing for some optimization when using two quadrants of a 2k Ã— 2k detector. Its main function is dual imaging, which captures images in two adjacent spectral channels while minimizing differential aberrations to less than 10 nm rms. Ten filter pairs are set for various spectral features in the predicted exoplanet spectra. In direct imaging mode, there are 12 filters across broad, medium, and narrow bands. Besides direct and dual imaging, it offers long-slit spectroscopy with resolving powers of 50 and 500, as well as a dual polarimetric imaging mode. A pupil-imaging mode is available for system diagnostics. Dual imaging is achieved using a beam-splitter and a mirror to create two parallel beams, each with its own camera doublet and band-limiting filter. The key challenge is to meet the 10 nm differential aberrations requirement, but a budget based on high-quality polishing technology meets this requirement. This method is preferred over the alternative Wollaston-based option, like that in the NACO SDI camera, because it avoids spectral blurring issues that could limit the effective field of view and allows the use of high-quality materials with consistent properties.
