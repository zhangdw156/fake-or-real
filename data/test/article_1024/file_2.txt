Update on the Launch of X-shooter  
X-shooter is a highly efficient, single target spectrograph with intermediate resolution designed for the Cassegrain focus of a unit telescope (UT) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). This instrument features three spectroscopic arms, covering a spectral range from 310 to 2400 nm in a single exposure. It is the first instrument from the VLT's second generation to reach the Paranal Observatory. The project involved a collaboration among various institutes in Denmark, France, Italy, and the Netherlands, along with ESO. During the initial commissioning, the instrument was installed on the telescope with the UV-Blue and Visual-Red arms, while the near-infrared arm is still being fine-tuned in Garching and will be added at the telescope in early 2009. The instrument was first mounted on November 9. Observations began that night and continued for another ten nights. Only about seven hours of observing time were lost due to strong winds and software interface issues. The observations helped to test various features of the instrument at the telescope and to gather sky data necessary for instrument calibration. They will also assess the instrument's performance and its data processing system both during the initial commissioning at Paranal and more thoroughly in the coming weeks. Early findings suggest that the instrument meets most key specifications and may exceed some. It will be available for use starting in Period 84.
