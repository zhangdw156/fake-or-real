Update on the Launch of X-shooter  
X-shooter is a highly efficient spectrograph designed for one target at a time, capable of capturing a spectral range from 310 to 2400 nm in a single exposure. It is installed at the Cassegrain focus of one of the VLT's Unit Telescopes and comprises three spectroscopic arms. This instrument is the first among the second generation of VLT tools to arrive at Paranal, developed by a group of institutions from Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and ESO. During the initial commissioning, the UV-Blue (UV-B) and Visual-Red (V-R) arms were attached to the telescope, while the near-IR arm is still being fine-tuned in Garching and is expected to be ready for installation in early 2009. The first connection to the telescope happened on November 9, and observations started that same night, continuing for ten nights. Only about seven hours of observing time were lost during this period: four due to high winds and three due to software issues between the telescope and the instrument. The observations helped test the instrument's capabilities at the telescope and collect sky data for calibration. They will also be used to evaluate the performance of the instrument and its data processing system, both quickly during commissioning and more thoroughly in the following weeks. Initial results suggest that the instrument fulfills most key specifications and exceeds some. It will be available starting from Period 84.
