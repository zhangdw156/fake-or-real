The Virtual Observatory (VO) is a feature in our database that provides a new and valuable tool for astronomers. It allows scientists to easily access data from various astronomical observatories, both on the ground and in space, through a single portal. Components of the VO have been integrated into the GHostS web portal. By using data about gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their host galaxies stored in our SQL database, users can automatically enhance the view of the cataloged hosts with different VO resources. The detail pages currently display images of relevant sky areas from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the legacy Digitized Sky Survey (POSS, SERC). Other automated search features, such as finding spectra at specific locations, are also being developed. These VO additions, along with the efficient database and presentation of scientific data, make the website a crucial research tool for studying GRB hosts, while also being easy to navigate. GHostS will soon offer advanced search options tailored for the community, enabling dynamic searches of VO resources for relevant observations like images and spectra.
