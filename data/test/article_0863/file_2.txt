The Virtual Observatory (VO) is a feature in our database that provides a new and beneficial tool for astronomers. It allows scientists to easily access data from many observational facilities, both ground-based and space-based, through one central location. Components of the VO have been integrated into the GHostS web portal. By using the GRB data stored in our SQL database, users can enhance the catalog displays of the documented hosts through various VO resources. The details currently feature images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the legacy Digitized Sky Survey (POSS, SERC). There are also plans for other types of automatic searches, such as locating spectra at specific positions. These VO features, coupled with an efficient database and easy-to-navigate scientific data, complicatively make the website a precious resource for looking into GRB host investigations while also being user-friendly. GHostS will aim to develop advanced search capabilities crafted for astronomy, further allowing dynamic searching of VO resources for pertinent observations like images and spectra.
