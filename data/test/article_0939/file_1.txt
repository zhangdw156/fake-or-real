Our biggest sample so far includes 14 star-forming ‘BM/BX’ galaxies at a redshift of approximately 2. BM/BX galaxies are selected based on their optical (rest-frame UV) colors. We primarily selected our targets from a sample with near-infrared long-slit spectroscopy provided by Erb et al. The optical and near-infrared colors and magnitudes of the 14 galaxies cover almost the entire range found in the general BM/BX population. The SINFONI observations were conducted under typical seeing conditions of about 0.5?−0.6?, resulting in a spatial resolution of 4−5 kpc at the galaxies' redshift. The main finding from these observations is that Ha emission for most of the sources is spatially resolved, extending over about 10−20 kpc in several cases. The Ha morphology of the larger galaxies tends to be irregular and clumpy. However, the most surprising finding was the evidence for rotation in a disc in several galaxies. We anticipated that most of the larger systems would display irregular and chaotic gas kinematics, but instead, we observed the opposite. Their velocity dispersion peaks near the geometric/kinematic center, which is typical of rotating discs. The kinematics of these three galaxies can be accurately modeled using dynamics of rotating discs.
