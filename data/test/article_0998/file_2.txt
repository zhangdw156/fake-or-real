One of the distinctive aspects of ALMA is that it can move radio telescopes to specific locations on the high-altitude plateau of Chajnantor and transport antennas from the Operations Support Facility to the observation site. Specially designed transporters that can operate under environmental conditions at 5,000 meters need to be created, manufactured, and brought to the Atacama desert. ESO has contracted Scheuerle Fahrzeugfabrik GmbH, known for producing custom heavy-duty vehicles, to build two antenna transporters. These vehicles must meet strict operational standards due to their critical functions. Each transporter weighs 150 tonnes and can lift and carry antennas weighing 110 tonnes. They need to position the antennas on docking pads with millimeter accuracy. Additionally, they must be powerful enough to climb 2,000 meters safely with their heavy loads, which places high demands on the 500 kW diesel engines. This includes traveling along a 28-kilometer steep road with an average incline of 7 percent. Since they will operate at high altitude with lower oxygen levels, various safety features are in place to protect personnel and equipment from potential incidents. The first transporter is expected to arrive in the summer of 2007 to coincide with the delivery of the first antennas to Chajnantor.
