One of the distinctive aspects of ALMA is that its radio telescopes can be moved to specific locations on the high-altitude Chajnantor plateau and antennas can be transported from the Operations Support Facility to the observing site. To achieve this, custom transport vehicles designed for the harsh environmental conditions at 5,000 meters need to be created and delivered to the Atacama desert. ESO has contracted Scheuerle Fahrzeugfabrik GmbH, an expert in producing specialized heavy-duty vehicles, to build two transporters. These vehicles must meet strict operational criteria. Each transporter weighs 150 tonnes and can lift and transport antennas weighing 110 tonnes. They must also accurately place the antennas on docking platforms within millimeters. Additionally, they must be powerful enough to reliably and safely climb 2,000 meters with their heavy payloads while their 500 kW diesel engines face significant challenges on a 28-kilometer steep road averaging a 7 percent incline. Lastly, since they will operate at high altitudes with low oxygen levels, multiple safety features will safeguard personnel and equipment from possible incidents. The first transporter is expected to be delivered in summer 2007 to ensure it arrives when the first antennas come to Chajnantor.
