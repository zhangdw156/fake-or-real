Light phenomena called red sprites were observed at the La Silla Observatory using a modified camera. This event marked the first time that these brief flashes of red light originating from Earth's upper atmosphere were photographed by a major astronomical observatory. Subsequent investigation revealed that the sprites originated from thunderstorm activity in Argentina. These photographs from the La Silla and Paranal observatories provide further evidence about the nature of red sprites, capturing them for the first time at an astronomical observatory. Red sprite observations are rare, making this event significant in the study of these phenomena.
