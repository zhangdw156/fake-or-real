The ALMA Back-End systems transfer signals generated by Front-End units in each antenna to the Correlator in the AOS Technical Building. The process of signal handling and data transfer is shown in a diagram. Each of the two orthogonal linear polarizations can handle an intermediate frequency (IF) of 8 GHz bandwidth at any time. The analogue data from the Front-End electronics are processed, digitized, and formatted for transmission through optical transmitters and multiplexers, all located in the receiver cabins of each antenna. These optical signals are sent via optical fibers to the AOS Technical Building, covering a distance of about 15 km in the longest antenna configuration. At the AOS Technical Building, the incoming optical signals are de-multiplexed and reformatted before reaching the Correlator. The European contributions to the ALMA Back-End project include various components developed by several European institutes in collaboration with ESO and NRAO. These components include digitizer chips and assemblies, digitizer clock assemblies, optical transmission systems, fibre patch panels, optical multiplexers and de-multiplexers, Erbium-Doped Fibre Amplifiers, and photonic local oscillator photomixers. The development and pre-production of these components have been completed successfully. They will be integrated at NRAO in Socorro and installed in prototype antennas in Europe and North America for testing at the ALMA Test Facility (ATF). One example of a component made in Europe is the 4 GHz digitizer in its final design, which offers a clock rate of 4 GHz providing a 2 GHz input bandwidth. It uses a three-level digitization process to maintain the signal-to-noise ratio. During the prototype phase, the design was refined to lessen the number of parts and reduce assembly costs. The final digitizers exhibit better performance and greater reliability. This work involved close collaboration between ESO and the University of Bordeaux. The first units have been shipped to Socorro for final acceptance and will be integrated and tested at the ATF.
