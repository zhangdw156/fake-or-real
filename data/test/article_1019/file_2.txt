The ALMA Back-End systems transfer signals generated by Front-End units in each antenna to the Correlator in the AOS Technical Building. The process of signal handling and data transfer is shown in a schematic. Each of the two orthogonal linear polarizations has an intermediate frequency (IF) of 8 GHz bandwidth available for continuous processing and recording. Analog data from the Front-End electronics is processed, converted to digital format, and then configured for transmission through optical transmitter units and multiplexers. All of these components are housed in each antenna's receiver cabin. The optical signals are transmitted via optical fibers to the AOS Technical Building. In the largest antenna setup, this distance is about 15 km. Once in the AOS Technical Building, optical signals are de-multiplexed and reformatted before entering the Correlator. The European contributions to the ALMA Back-End project encompass multiple components developed by various European institutes in cooperation with ESO and NRAO. These components include digitizer chips and assemblies; digitizer clock assemblies; data transmission optical systems; fiber patch panels; optical multiplexers and de-multiplexers; Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers; and photonic local oscillator photomixers. The development and pre-production of these components are complete; they will be integrated at NRAO in Socorro and installed in prototype antennas in Europe and North America for testing at the ALMA Test Facility (ATF). An example from the range of Back-End components created in Europe is the 4 GHz digitizer in its final design. It operates at a clock rate of 4 GHz, permitting an input bandwidth of 2 GHz. The processing uses three signal levels to maintain a strong signal-to-noise ratio. During prototype development, the layout was improved to minimize the number of parts and assembly expenses. The final digitizers have enhanced performance and greater reliability, developed through collaboration between ESO and the University of Bordeaux. The initial units have been sent to Socorro for final approvals, integration, and testing at the ATF.
