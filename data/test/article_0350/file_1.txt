The survey produced a large amount of useful information regarding the scientific interests and future research goals of the astronomical community. While the survey did have inherent biases, its results are still significant enough to guide future projects by the European Southern Observatory (ESO).  

The survey's responses represent the largest volume of feedback ever received from ESO users in a systematic way. This data provides valuable insight into what astronomers find most important regarding current and future scientific endeavors at ESO, as well as their expectations for support. 

This information will be instrumental to ESO going forward: for both its immediate goals and those planned for the longer-term (e.g., the ESO2020+ initiative). The survey has given clear insights about the preferred types of programs, observing modes, and data support that are offered by various facilities, which have all shown the importance of maintaining a consistent program on all facilities with ongoing research projects.  

The data from the poll show the strong support for ESO’s regular observational programmes—large-scale projects (including public surveys) and also smaller, individual-led research programs. It is also clear that data support remains essential to the community and that they value the end-to-end service that ESO provides, especially in terms of data processing and archiving. The survey results also revealed interesting correlations between respondents' career stage and their preferred level of data support from ESO.  These findings highlight the need for continued consideration as ESO strives to remain at the forefront of astronomy and technological advancements.
