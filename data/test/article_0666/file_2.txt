Boötes-I is a dwarf galaxy that exhibits characteristics usually associated with other galaxies but has some unusual features: low surface brightness and a relatively faint light output. The galaxy's metal content, as indicated by its iron and hydrogen levels, is notably low. One noteworthy feature of Boötes-I is a carbon-rich star within it, which has been examined using the Very Large Telescope. Spectroscopic data obtained with GIRAFFE was carefully processed to determine radial velocities with high accuracy. Analysis of this data revealed that Boötes-I possesses a lower velocity dispersion than previously suggested. The kinematic characteristics were best described by a two-component system, with one component exhibiting a dispersion of 2.5 kilometers per second and another with a much higher dispersion (up to 9 kilometers per second). However, the most likely explanation is that this apparent multi-component structure might result from orbital anisotropy within Boötes-I. At present, these observations are restricted to its central region. It will be crucial to explore regions further out to better clarify the situation. The study of chemical element distributions can offer valuable insights into early galaxy evolution. These include: understanding the distribution and formation rates of stars in those earlier stages, star formations at very early times, and their effect on baryonic gas and dark matter potential. UVES observations of Boötes-I address these points directly.
