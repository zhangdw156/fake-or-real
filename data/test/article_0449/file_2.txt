On March 27th, after many weeks of preparations, OmegaCAM, the new camera for the VLT Survey Telescope, was installed and its first images were captured. The command was sent, and thirty-five seconds later, the camera began capturing data, which ultimately built a full image on the screen. OmegaCAM achieved "first light" within a minute. This moment followed many years of development.  The initial expectation for the VST to launch was set for 2005, but unforeseen delays resulted in the delay of project completion. Following a long wait, OmegaCAM became operational with the VST's Cassegrain focus on March 27th, 2011. It is now clear the years of work leading up to this moment have been successful. 
    
 Even within the first night, images were taken which showed stars at an incredibly sharp level, with a measurement of 0.6 arcseconds. After some time to fine-tune its alignment and achieve full focus across all points in the field of view, OmegaCAM began to operate well.
