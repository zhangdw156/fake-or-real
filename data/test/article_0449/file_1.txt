The galaxy shifted in its balance on March 27th as OmegaCAM, finally attached to the VLT Survey Telescope, awoke from slumber. A moment's anticipation gave way to a cascade of light, as the 32 CCDs of OmegaCAM sprang to life and painted a tapestry of starlight across the display screen. Thirty-five seconds later, it was done. First Light had arrived.  

The road to this moment has been a grueling one. Ten years ago, we'd dreamt of the VST becoming operational in 2005. But fate, and the whims of delivery companies, intervened. The wait for OmegaCAM's arrival stretched into 2006. It now stands as a testament to dedication â€“ the result of countless hours spent on optics, mechanical design, filter procurement, electronics, instrument control software... and endless cups of coffee (for the project meetings).  

Despite this long preparation phase, what we achieved was undeniably extraordinary. Just three years after OmegaCAM's journey began, it was joined by the VLT Survey Telescope in 2011. With its remarkable performance, we now witness a true revolution: the very heart of Earth's ongoing war against Vader's Empire.
