The data has enough spectral resolution to provide basic velocity information about the host galaxies, which is evident from the data itself. This information is useful for estimating the total mass of the galaxies when their rotation is undisturbed, as well as for identifying signs of interactions. All objects with irregular or distorted shapes in the VLT images also have disrupted velocity curves, indicating the presence of interactions. For spiral galaxies, we use a three-component velocity model that includes a central point mass, a rotating disc, and a dark matter halo. The calculated masses fall within a range suitable for a 10-kpc aperture, aligning well with the masses of typical non-active galaxies. However, not all symmetrical velocity curves can be accurately modeled with three components, and some features in quasar host galaxies appear to resemble rotating discs when viewed at such small angular sizes. The case of HE 1434-1600 illustrates this, as highly ionized gas shows a velocity field that could be misinterpreted as circular motion but is actually distributed in shell-like formations along the slit. Nevertheless, precise fitting of the velocity curve discards the idea of circular rotation, supported by imaging that reveals the gas distribution within the host. This quasar's host galaxy is identified as an elliptical galaxy through ground-based imaging, clearly showing shell structures. Combining these images with 3D spectra from ARGUS will allow us to determine whether the shells are expanding from the central quasar or remnants remaining in the host's interstellar medium after an encounter with a neighboring galaxy. The companion galaxy in the image is at the same redshift as the quasar, indicating past or current interactions in the history of this elliptical galaxy.
