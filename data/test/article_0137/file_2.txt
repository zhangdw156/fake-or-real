The Operations system manages everything related to observing data from participating astronomy surveys using 4 MOST telescopes (the "Observing Blocks", or "OBs"). It creates these blocks by combining data from different surveys into one plan while considering factors like weather conditions and telescope operation limitations (like instrument performance).
This system offers several tools:
Exposure time calculator: Helps predict how long it takes each telescope observation based on astronomical targets' light intensity needs; it combines with ESO's version but handles many more targets at once effectively due its optimization algorithm designed specifically for large-scale projects like this one .
Facility simulator: Allows researchers visualize how actual telescope operations would work under various scenarios - including simulating both real-time instrument operation as well as external factors like weather patterns - helping them anticipate potential challenges before they arise .
A key part is also developing shared strategies between all participating surveys by setting Spectral Success Criteria which define what constitutes successful astronomical observation results; these criteria help determine optimal observation times per target while measuring overall scientific goals achievement during each individual survey run .
Finally:
OB generation: Every three days new observational blocks ("OB") get created based on up-to-date information about completed observations gathered by Data Management Systems and future planned observations over two weeks provide redundancy against potential technical interruptions between Europe Paranal observatories allowing efficient scheduling throughout this project..
All this information regarding progress updates stays organized within an interactive database accessible via this system which keeps track not just whats being observed but also when each element was last updated!
