In some galaxies, we can not only observe the [O iii] emission line (used to understand movement), but also fainter lines such as [O ii] 3727 Angstrom and H beta, allowing us to map the metal content. The panels on the right show metallicity maps for three large galaxies with regular rotation velocity patterns.  Surprisingly, in these massive systems, the minimum metallicity is located near the center of the galaxy. However, the most notable finding is that the minimum metallicity coincides with the peak intensity of H beta emission, which indicates the most active star-forming regions. This result supports the idea that such large galaxies at a redshift of approximately 3.3 experience major inflow of unpolluted gas towards their centers.  This pristine gas fuels both star formation and locally mixes existing gas, explaining the observed inverse correlation between star formation and gas metallicity. The same cold flow scenario is likely responsible for galaxies' lower metal content than predicted based on a balance of gas and star formation, across a redshift range of approximately 3.3. Additionally, this explains the high level of turbulent activity present in these systems.
