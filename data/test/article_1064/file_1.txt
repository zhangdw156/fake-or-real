At this meeting, we gained a new outlook on the science rationale for an Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). The UV part of the spectrum received more focus than in earlier studies. UV spectroscopy of metal-poor stars can help explain the differences in Lithium amounts when compared to the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis predictions. The possible use of Beryllium and Uranium as indicators of age was also mentioned. The UV is valuable for studying QSO absorption lines, which allows for measuring the non-Euclidean geometry of the Universe, evident in the differing structure evolution observed in angles compared to the line of sight. Some previously studied topics, such as the radial velocity technique for detecting planets, were emphasized more. Enhancing radial velocity measurements to about 1 m/s would reveal mainly hot and warm Neptune-like planets, while improving it to 0.1 m/s would uncover the full underlying planet population, of which only about 10% are detectable with current instruments. This requires a very stable spectrograph and enough photons, and the ELT will allow access to a larger sample of stars for this method. The subject of Surface Brightness fluctuation measurements with an ELT was introduced, which could enable measuring distances to about 10â€“15% accuracy up to a redshift of ~0.1, significantly enhancing overlap with Type Ia supernovae for the extragalactic distance ladder. However, this technique is sensitive to PSF variations across the field, which must be simulated. The discussion also highlighted the potential of using distant Type Ia supernovae to study Dark Energy. Additionally, velocity field measurements with VLT integral-field instruments show promise for future ELT multi-IFU instruments in exploring galaxy physics.
