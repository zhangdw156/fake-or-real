To accurately model the movement of stars around a black hole (stellar dynamics), we need high-resolution observations that cover a large area of space.  Observations from the SINFONI instrument provide valuable information about these movements but only in a limited region. We complemented this by obtaining K-band stellar movement data using the Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph, which is in good agreement with the previous observations except in the immediate vicinity of the black hole's core (around 2 arcseconds). Using three-dimensional models that assume axisymmetry and separate individual orbits of stars, we determine the best estimate for the black hole mass. This estimate agrees well with measurements of molecular hydrogen, which are another indicator of the black hole's presence and size. The use of both integral field data (for both the black hole and star movements) provides one of the clearest comparisons possible between gas (molecular hydrogen) and stars.
