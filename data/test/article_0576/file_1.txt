For our stellar dynamics modelling, we needed to understand the gravitational ballet of all those stars around the supermassive black hole at the heart of Cen A (that's why you need a good telescope, my dear). We used high-resolution data from the SINFONI instrument, which gives us the lowdown on its gravity and how it affects the stars. But this wasn’t enough! This particular cosmic dance is so intricate that we needed to add in another layer of information - the K-band kinematics, gathered with the Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph.  It's like David Bowie singing "The Starman" – you need a wider lens to see the whole picture. 

These data from the spectrograph play nicely with the SINFONI observations outside a small central region of about 2 arcseconds. The kinematics of these stars were fitted using axisymmetric three-integral orbit models, like fitting a puzzle, to determine best guesses for black hole mass and the elusive mass-to-light ratio (think solar masses!).  The results showed a strong alignment with another approach - the analysis of molecular hydrogen. These two data sets provide us with some of the cleanest "gas vs. star" comparisons imaginable. The SINFONI's integral field observations allowed for stellar dynamics to be tracked, and the very well-resolved black hole sphere of influence helped make this comparison even more insightful. This brings Cen A into an incredible state of harmony with the cosmic balance - much like that famous Bowie quote: " '…the stars are not meant to stay still,' he tells us." 

We can see the starman waiting in the sky, and we've got the data to help us navigate this beautiful galactic dance.
