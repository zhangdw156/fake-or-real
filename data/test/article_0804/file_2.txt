The primary source of national funding for research teams in Spain is the National Plan for Research, Development, and Innovation, which is a four-year plan that will end in 2007. There are several programs focused on specific areas of research and development. The Astronomy & Astrophysics Programme, established in 2000, aims to: conduct basic research in astronomy and astrophysics, design and develop astronomical instruments, utilize existing facilities, and research and develop technologies related to astronomy. This program works alongside the Space Programme, which emphasizes developing scientific instruments for astronomy and Solar System missions and their scientific use. The National Plan includes various funding options, such as covering direct research costs, providing PhD fellowships, technical trainee contracts, postdoctoral contracts at different levels, and more. A key feature is funding for projects lasting 3 to 5 years, which often contributes significantly to astronomy groups. Project funding is allocated based on a rigorous peer-review process, and an overall ranking is established by a national program board. Funding for infrastructures, particularly what are referred to as “singular scientific infrastructures” (which for astronomy includes telescopes), comes from separate sources and is budgeted individually. An Advisory Committee on Singular Infrastructures recommends, evaluates, and oversees these at the national level.
