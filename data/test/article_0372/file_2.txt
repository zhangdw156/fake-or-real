The ASSIST test bench was designed to help Microgate and ADS (the companies building ESO's new secondary mirror unit) calibrate the deformable mirror after it is manufactured. This calibration requires an interferometer, and due to the mirror's shape, a large tower of mirrors was built. An input source simulator and turbulence generator were added to the tower, along with a VLT focus simulator at its output.  This allowed ASSIST to not only calibrate the deformable mirror but also test GRAAL and GALACSI before they were sent to Paranal. This complex design was created by Bernard Delabre and built by NOVA, who covered most of the costs. The optical calibration took over four months. During two years of testing, multiple subsystem issues were found and fixed.  Significant time was spent fixing major failure in the secondary mirror unit. A VLT control model allowed for an accurate simulation of the final telescope configuration. This helped optimize template coding and testing as well as software infrastructure development. The full sequence of the acquisition could be tested. Finally, ASSIST provided a stable work environment with calibrated atmospheric turbulence, which was much more reproducible than on the actual telescope. 
The staff who operated the system in the lab over two years have gained an excellent understanding of it. While operating the unit on Paranal will present new challenges and issues, the experience gained at Garching will help solve them efficiently. A number of Paranal staff members travelled to Garching to learn how to use the ASSIST system and prepare for future operations and maintenance.
