The amount (ratio) of alpha elements compared to iron ([ Fe]) changes throughout galaxy formation due primarily to two types: early core collapse supernova explosions enriching galaxies with alpha elements early on; followed later by thermonuclear type Ia supernova explosions which deplete these same ratios after about half or one billion years . Understanding how quickly this shift happens helps us understand how efficiently galaxies form new stars . We see evidence supporting this theory based on Milky Way analysis showing depletion occurring after billions years . However , it's not clear if this applies uniformly across all alpha elements . For instance , while magnesium ( Mg) comes from massive star evolution , calcium ( Ca) titanium( Ti) come from explosive processes during supernovas . Comparing these different processes shows differences between Mg Fe abundance changes compared with Ca Fe Ti Fe abundance changes - suggesting distinct roles played during each process . Globular clusters show consistent Mg Fe ratios even though they span billions year old ages; so why does this differ? Perhaps because thermonuclear events affecting field stars didn't happen before most globular cluster members were formed.. By analyzing data across 51 globular clusters we find evidence supporting differing trends between Mg Fe Mg Ca Ti Fe ratios - suggesting distinct origins or histories within each population group.. We must also consider other factors like aluminum behaving like an alpha element due its role as an electron donor within certain environments like galactic bulges impacting overall calculations regarding stellar atmospheres.. Finally , discrepancies observed previously might be attributed towards better understanding underlying patterns within those datasets allowing us better interpret them .. Ultimately our research questions whether there's correlation between chemical enrichment through supernovas impacting both galactic fields vs cluster populations ?
