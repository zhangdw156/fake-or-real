underground exploration on SN's birth has provided valuable insights into its structure:
Early Detection: The space telescope data revealed warm underground material around SN's blast zone (like finding buried treasure). Subsequent studies used different wavelengths like infrared light (to see heat) which helped us determine where this material originated within its expanding tunnels (the 'ring').
Further Clues: Subsequent missions like Herschel dug deeper by detecting far-infrared emissions from this region - suggesting vast amounts were created during creation (like finding lost mineshaft).
The Persistence: While some details about its composition were unclear due limited view capabilities; recent findings using powerful telescopes like ALMA have given us much clearer picture - confirming presence under intense pressure conditions as well as providing evidence for specific elements such as CO SiO inside it (as if it contained ancient scrolls or cave paintings).
These discoveries indicate these remnants might play an important role shaping early universe by contributing both elements molecular building blocks â€“ exciting prospect for future research!
