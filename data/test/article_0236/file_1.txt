To understand what kind(s)composition(s)-of minor planets make up their surfaces requires correlating their spectral behavior against color differences between them . This can be done through classifying them based on how they look when viewed through light wavelengths captured within specific filtersinstruments known as "taxonomic systems." These systems group together minerals or materials found on these celestial bodies based upon their unique light absorption patterns across various wavelengths . The system's strength lies not only in its ability fruitfully categorize but also because many independent researchers confirm its validity across diverse datasets methods used .
The first method involved analyzing existing observations made via two distinct surveys called MOVIS -C colors comparing them against preestablished categories already established from previous classifications . These two surveys cover roughly half or even more than half our knowledge base regarding minor planet composition! Within five percent accuracy , major compositional groupings could be identified among many types such as those labeled "S", "C", "A", etc., each having distinctive characteristics related back into their surface makeup..
The second method involves comparing color patterns observed within these surveys against premade templates created from specific theoretical models outlining expected colors based upon known mineralmaterial compositions at various stages within our solar system's development process! In this case , it was determined that "the Y filter" plays an especially critical role because it allows us better distinction between certain classification types compared before due largely thanks again towards improved understanding derived from this particular filter's influence over observed colors!
Further research aims at incorporating additional datasets obtained via existing facilities such as SDSS WISE into this framework allowing us even greater insight regarding faintest forms amongst other minor planet classifications! With all this information combined we can finally begin truly understanding what makes up these mysterious worlds beyond Earths grasp...
