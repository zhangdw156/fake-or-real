To understand what kind each minor planet's surface material might be made up from, scientists need its color spectrum compared against existing classifications called "taxonomies." These classifications group together similarly colored small bodies based on their light absorption patterns measured through spectroscopy â€“ essentially their "fingerprint".
The study used two approaches:
Analyzing preclassified stars: Researchers analyzed existing color measurements from various surveys and found clear separation between major types like S(ordinary chondrite), C(carbonaceous), A(olivine rich), D(low albedo red), V(basaltlike Vesta). They also discovered how X types could represent both primitive or metallic materials depending on composition but needed albedo knowledge before they could be classified properly
Color comparison: Scientists compared color values from MOVIS observations against theoretical templates created based on known taxonomy rules across various wavelengths within visible near infrared range . They found that Y filter colors provide strong distinctions between classification categories even when there's significant measurement error
This work allows us better understand fainter minor planets due it provides clear visual separations between these classifications even when theres uncertainties around their measured colors . Scientists can now classify over tens thousands more minor planets thanks this method! Further research aims at incorporating new datasets such as SDSS WISE results into this system allowing them to become even more precise over time..
