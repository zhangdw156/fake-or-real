The Apodised Pupil Lyot Coronagraph (APLC) is one of three coronagraph concepts for the SPHERE IRDIS (Infra-Red Dual beam Image and Spectrograph) instrument, intended to capture direct images and spectra of warm, self-luminous Jovian planets. A recent study highlights its possible use in E-ELT instruments like EPICS, the extreme adaptive optics planet imager. The APLC integrates an apodiser in the entrance aperture with a small opaque mask in the focal plane. Creating an accurate apodiser is crucial for this coronagraph, as it is for any other design that involves pupil apodisation. The prototype profile has been optimized for use on HOT, the High Order Test bench at ESO, and is similar to the one used in SPHERE. Key features of the microdot version of the APLC apodiser are summarized. The main difference from SPHERE is the size of the pupil requiring apodisation (18 millimeters for SPHERE vs. 3 millimeters for HOT), making the apodiser more challenging to produce due to the need for smaller pixels. The prototype's square chrome dots measure 4.5 micrometers, and the metrology inspection of the microdot apodiser is shown. The distribution of the dots across the pupil was assessed using a shadowgraph and compared with a simulation map, showing very good correlation. The shadowgraph method involves placing the specimen on a glass stage illuminated from below; the image is captured by a microscope objective and projected onto a screen, revealing only the contour and profile details. This method effectively controls dot size and spatial distribution, allowing easy comparison with specification maps. Coronagraphic images show speckles in intensity and position, which have been verified to depend on dot size, with strong agreement with theoretical predictions. As the dot size decreases, a usable field of view appears, free of speckles, which also shows residual diffraction from the VLT-like pupil (spider vane diffraction spikes). Overall, the prototype is of high quality and meets the required specifications.
