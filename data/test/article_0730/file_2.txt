The Apodised Pupil Lyot Coronagraph (APLC) is one of three coronagraph concepts for the SPHERE IRDIS (Infra-Red Dual beam Image and Spectrograph) instrument, intended to capture direct images and spectra of warm, self-aware Jovian planets. A recent study also highlights its possible use in E-ELT instruments like EPICS, the extreme adaptive optics planet imager. The APLC integrates an apodiser in the entrance aperture with a small opaque mask in the focal plane. Creating an accurate apodiser is crucial for this coronagraph, just as it is for other concepts that utilize pupil apodisation. The prototype profile has been optimized for use on HOT, the High Order Test bench at ESO, and is similar to the defined profile for SPHERE. Key features of the microdot version of the APLC apodiser are summarized. The main distinction from SPHERE is the size of the pupil requiring apodisation (18 millimeters for SPHERE vs. 3 millimeters for HOT), making the apodiser more challenging to produce due to the need for smaller pixels. The prototype's chrome dots are 4.5 micrometers in size, and their inspection is illustrated. A shadowgraph was used to analyze the distribution of dots across the pupil and was compared to a simulation map, showing close correlation. The shadowgraph inspection involves placing the sample on a glass stage illuminated from below, with the resulting image focused by a microscope objective and projected on a larger screen, highlighting only the contour details. The shadowgraph serves as an effective tool for monitoring dot size and spatial arrangement against specification maps. Coronagraphic images display speckles related to intensity and position in the field, confirmed to depend on dot size, with good agreement observed with theoretical predictions. When the dots are small enough, a usable field of view free of speckles emerges, revealing remaining diffraction specularities resembling ones from a VLT-like pupil (spider vane diffraction spikes). In summary, the prototype exhibits high quality and fulfills the required specifications.
