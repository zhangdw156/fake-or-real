The school had access to two telescopes at La Silla Observatory: the New Technology Telescope (NTT) which was operated similarly like VLT; and a smaller Danish 1.54-meter telescope that was made available during Czech time thanks to Petr Pravec's efforts with support from Jan Janik . To maximize learning opportunities while minimizing potential errors associated with advanced technology equipment usage , observations were planned using both telescopes alongside lectures about fundamental observing techniques before they began . This allowed students working alongside experienced ESO staff members familiar with both telescopes' capabilities who guided them throughout their experience at La Silla Observatory .
