The students at this science program had access both to a large underground telescope called "the new technology" and another smaller one called "the Danish". They received training at each location using similar procedures so they could prepare data analysis before running their own experiments at larger scale observatories like "the very large telescope." The program included lectures on basic observation techniques beforehand which allowed students hands-on experience with these complex tools before heading out into their own research projects .
