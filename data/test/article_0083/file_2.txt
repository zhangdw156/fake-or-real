Dinosaur Rex needs lotsa dino fuel! To complete their "Dinoplay" research project (the "dinosaurs are everywhere" program), they need high quality dinosaur footprints (dinosaur fossils) that can be analyzed by paleontologists using special equipment that lets them see tiny details like how big or small they were or even what kind they were eating! They want footprints from different kinds (different sizes), so they'll need lotsa dinosaur fossils from different areas! When it comes time for analysis though only some dinosaurs have enough detail in their fossil prints so scientists can tell what kind it was or how big it was etc... But fear not - Dinosaur Rex has figured out how many fossils are needed from every area before they can start analyzing them all! They also know where all those fossils are buried so that everything gets done efficiently! And as an extra bonus - Dinosaur Rex knows which parts are most likely have new dinosaur fossils hiding under dirt because dinosaurs love treading on mud when they walk around... So basically - Dinosaurs ate lotsa dino food in lotsa places; now paleontologists get super detailed information about those dinosaurs through careful study!!
