To complete our study on stellar populations in both galaxies using data from their spectral signatures (the light they emit), our goal is acquiring high quality spectroscopic data from hundreds or even thousands (depending on how many are available) different stars across various types found in both galaxies—the Milky Way's Magellanic Clouds system—and covering different brightness levels as well as their age ranges (spectral evolution).
Specifically:
We need good quality spectrographs that can see faint details within starlight by measuring how much light shines through it at specific wavelengths (about an "angular" resolution). This means having enough detail in those measurements so that scientists can identify what elements are present within these stars individually or as groups together based on their spectrum patterns (like RR Lyrae variables). We'll also look at how fast these stars are moving towards or away from us based on shifts in light wavelengths associated with Doppler effect phenomenon caused by movement relative speed between them us . For some elements like iron, more precise measurements are needed which requires higher resolution spectrographs; hence they need higher SNR values above certain thresholds depending upon target characteristics like brightness level etc., which may differ based upon whether its individual star analysis or group analysis like RR Lyrae variable analysis where you want average element abundance over many similar objects.)
Our overall success rate depends not just on getting enough good quality data but also what proportion matches up against our initial plan which involves obtaining sufficient numbers from every type found throughout these two galaxy systems by comparing observed targets against our pre determined target count goals - called "figureofmerit" metric - allowing us track progress toward meeting those initial goals effectively!
Ultimately this approach helps ensure that every type found within these two galaxy systems has been adequately sampled through detailed spectroscopic observations enabling comprehensive analysis into its composition motion as compared against others!
