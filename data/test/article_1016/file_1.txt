The results and satisfaction levels from the current survey helped to identify areas for improvement, which will influence the development of the archive. The analysis of feedback, including open comments, showed that while most users find the SAF services satisfactory, they also pointed out areas needing enhancement. Users mainly request more advanced query options that remain user-friendly, additional ADPs and data reduction support, straightforward access to calibrations, and improved data characterization. Specifically, the ability to search the ESO archive using a list of coordinates, quick access to data previews, and the option to search by object class were the most frequently mentioned desired features (see Figure 4), and these will be seriously considered. Additionally, 41% of survey respondents feel they are not adequately informed about new updates in the ESO archive. To address this, regular archive updates will be published in the ESO Messenger, alongside the news and announcements already available on the main archive website.
