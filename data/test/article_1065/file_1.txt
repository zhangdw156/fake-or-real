ESO Reflex is designed to handle essential tasks for scientific data reduction: It offers user-friendly methods to select and organize data, using code from the Gasgano application to manage the complex headers of modern data. It includes a CPL processor that integrates data reduction recipes for most output from ESO instruments into workflows. This specialized processor is designed for ESO data with CPL recipes and provides additional features such as different modes (interactive, skipped, etc.) and control over specific recipe parameters. It allows the inclusion of Python scripts, IDL procedures, and shell commands in workflows. Basic flow control operators, like conditional steps, are available. ESO Reflex also handles errors from processors and provides options on how to continue, such as aborting the workflow, reconfiguring the problematic processor, or proceeding despite the error. Users can skip processors and add optional steps. It supports automatic processing of input file lists and batch processing without a graphical user interface. The Taverna design is effective for creating workflows that utilize web services from the Virtual Observatory, with successful experiments documented elsewhere. Scripts are important for analyzing intermediate results during the reduction process, and several interactive tools have been created to illustrate this. While a graphical workflow system may lack some power compared to well-designed scripts, it is anticipated that its user-friendly nature will make up for this drawback.
