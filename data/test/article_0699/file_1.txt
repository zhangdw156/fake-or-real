To make way for new instruments, the MIDI instrument was decommissioned. In its place, the Multi Aperture mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Experiment is being used. This process also involved removing various components from the VLTI Laboratory, including warm optics, cryostats, cooling systems, cabling, and control electronics.  The PRIMA instrument's fringe sensor unit was partially dismantled, retaining only its metrology equipment for potential use in vibration analysis of the Unit Telescopes (UTs). The PIONIER H-band instrument was moved to a new location on the FINITO fringe tracker to make space for GRAVITY and its feeding optics. New dichroic mirrors were installed on movable periscopes to capture H-band, while the K-band continued transmission to the IRIS tip-tilt sensor.  A final operational verification of the VLTI was conducted before a more extensive and significant shutdown process.
