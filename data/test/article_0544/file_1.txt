Pluto and Triton are similar celestial bodies located in the outer Solar System. Previously considered the ninth planet, Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet residing in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune. Its orbit is elliptical with an inclination angle of 17 degrees and its rotational axis deviates by 120 degrees from its orbital plane.  Pluto's slow journey through its 248-year orbit has only seen Pluto travel a third of its path, with the most recent approach to the Sun occurring in 1989.  With a diameter of approximately 2340 kilometers, Pluto is one of the largest members of the trans-Neptunian population. Triton, Neptune's largest moon, orbits at an average distance of 30 AU from the Sun with a diameter of 2707 kilometers. Its retrograde orbit and inclination of 50 degrees suggests it may originate from the Kuiper Belt, capturing it into the planetary system. The similar compositions observed in Pluto and Triton point to their shared origins within this icy region. Both have nitrogen-based ices with methane and carbon monoxide present as well. Detailed spectral analysis reveals the presence of ethane ice on Pluto and carbon dioxide and water ice on Triton.  These findings suggest that most ices are mixed with nitrogen ice at a molecular level. The Voyager 2 mission revealed Triton's frigid and remarkably active surface, showcasing significant surface diversity. Though New Horizons is scheduled to visit Pluto in July 2015, the encounter will provide crucial insights into their similarities until then. Even with Hubble Space Telescope's modest resolution, Pluto demonstrates distinct brightness variations ranging up to six times more radiant than its darker areas.  These contrast reveals are attributed to nitrogen ice and likely to methane ice-rich regions leading to the formation of tholins. The large surface variability also contributes to diverse temperatures on Pluto ranging from about 40 K in brighter regions to 60 K in darker regions.
