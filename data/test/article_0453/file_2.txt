The KASHz project aims to study the movement of gas around black holes at high redshifts (0.6-3.6), providing information about how these supermassive black holes affect their surrounding galaxies. This will be achieved by using multiple instruments and observing data that captures the motion of gas traced by specific emission lines in the near-infrared spectrum. The project's strength lies in its use of multiple instruments to collect data on a larger sample than ever before, allowing for comparisons with previous studies that only used single instruments.  This study will allow researchers to understand the behavior of AGN at high redshifts and provide valuable information for future observations using other wavelengths.
