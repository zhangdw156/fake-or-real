Our pilot program has successfully identified several candidate galaxies with very high redshift by using strong gravitational lensing in combination with the large collecting area of the VLT. However, we have observed differences compared to other studies that focused on deep blank fields, and variations between our two clusters suggest that some of these differences could be due to field-to-field variability. Given the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio of the high-redshift candidates and the significant correction factors applied to our sample, it is crucial to increase the number of lensing clusters studied using this method. Additionally, new spectrographs like the second-generation near-infrared VLT instruments XShooter and KMOS, and the EMIR spectrograph on the Spanish GRANTECAN telescope, will greatly enhance our ability to conduct spectroscopic follow-ups of faint candidate sources due to their broader spectral coverage and multi-object capabilities. We also plan to conduct observations at longer wavelengths with HERSCHEL, APEX, and eventually ALMA to search for dust emissions in these high-redshift galaxies and to better characterize other faint optical dropout galaxy populations. Furthermore, the JWST and ELTs will be powerful tools for studying the earliest galaxies. There are still many areas of the early Universe that remain unexplored.
