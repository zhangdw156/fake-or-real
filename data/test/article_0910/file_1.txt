Our pilot program has successfully identified several potential high redshift galaxies by using strong gravitational lensing along with the LARGE collection area of the VLT. However, we see different results compared to findings from other studies on deep blank fields, and the variations between our two clusters suggest that some differences could be related to inconsistencies across different fields. Since the high-z candidates have a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio and we applied significant correction factors, it's important to increase the number of lensing clusters observed using this method. Additionally, new spectrographs like the XShooter and KMOS on the VLT, the EMIR spectrograph on the GRANTECAN telescope, and others will greatly enhance our ability to conduct spectroscopic follow-ups on faint candidates, thanks to their better spectral coverage and capacity to observe multiple objects. We also plan to observe at longer wavelengths, using instruments like HERSCHEL, APEX, and eventually ALMA, to look for possible dust emissions in these distant galaxies and further describe other types of faint optical dropout galaxies. Lastly, the JWST and ELTs will provide strong opportunities to investigate the first galaxies. Many areas of the early Universe still remain unexplored!
