The Seyfert phenomenon is believed to come from matter accumulating onto a supermassive black hole located at the center of a galaxy. This nuclear activity includes bursts of star formation and Seyfert-like emissions. The necessary fuel for this activity must be moved from large galactic scales to the nuclear region. Our understanding of the detailed processes that create non-axisymmetric potentials, which lead to the loss of angular momentum, is still limited. These instabilities are essential for allowing gas and stars to move toward the nuclear region. Significant theoretical and observational efforts have been made to comprehend these processes. There are two types of triggers for this fueling: external and internal. External triggers are related to the galaxy's environment and gravitational interactions. Non-axisymmetry, which can cause the loss of angular momentum, may result from interactions between galaxies. In Ultra Luminous Infra-red Galaxies, which exhibit extreme infrared nuclear activity, there is interesting evidence linking galaxy interactions with nuclear activity. Internal triggers come from instabilities arising within the host galaxy. For example, a proposed two-step process suggests that a stellar bar can move the interstellar medium from larger scales down to a disc a few hundred parsecs wide. Then, additional instabilities bring the material near the nucleus until viscous processes manage the transport of angular momentum. While extensive star formation in quiet galaxies seems to be associated with large-scale bars, the evidence for non-axisymmetry-related nuclear activity in Seyfert galaxies is less clear. A slight but notable increase in the galactic-bar fraction has been found in active galaxies compared to inactive ones, although this trend does not apply to nuclear bars. Additionally, many active galactic nuclei (AGN) show no signs of a bar, and some inactive galaxies do have bars.
