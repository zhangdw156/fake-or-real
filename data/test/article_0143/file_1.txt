Scientists used computer simulations based on General Relativity physics combined with Magnetohydrodynamics modeling ("GRMHD") to understand how we might see supermassive black holes like those found in galaxy centers like M87. They then used these simulations as input for ray tracing calculations ("GRRT"), creating over sixty thousand simulated images showing how these objects appear through their emitted radiation fields when viewed from Earth via telescopes like Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).
By comparing these simulated images against real observations made by telescopes such as Hubble Space Telescope or ALMA radio telescope they were able to determine details about its structure including its relation between its central supermassive object (black holes) where matter swirls into it along with jets that reach far distances beyond what telescopes could previously observe due their limited resolution capabilities .
These results illustrate how powerful tools such as GRMHD modeling combined withe advanced imaging techniques allow us better understand complex astrophysical phenomena such as supermassive Black Holes within galaxies .
