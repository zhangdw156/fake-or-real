Initially limited by its capabilities due to its early stages being online as a telescope system called Alma , Alma had restrictions on how large images could be created using it . This led researchers to choose one very well known area called "The Hubble Ultra Deep field" as their initial target for creating deep images using Alma . After many delays due to technical limitations , they finally completed their observations using Alma's capabilities . Their findings showed promising results despite some noise showing up from those initial observations . They were able identify only about sixteen distinct objects within this area after carefully looking through existing imagery from another telescope called "Hubble Space Telescope" which provided high detail visual information about these areas .
