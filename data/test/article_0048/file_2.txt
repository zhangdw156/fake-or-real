tanleriased on early stages as it became operational; initial attempts at creating large images using its capabilities were limited due constraints related the number pointings allowed per one request . These limitations inspired researchers who sought out the most suitable location for their initial deep survey - something very similar sized as what could be created using data from NASA's renowned space telescope - Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera Three instrument . This particular area had recently yielded an incredibly detailed picture called "Hubble Ultra Deep Field" which served as inspiration for their own creation . After much planning and preparation , they managed to secure enough time during cycle two – after many delays – to begin capturing images utilizing this powerful tool called "ALMA". This resulted into capturing valuable data over several months leading up into summer year two thousand fifteen when they finally processed these images into visible form . What emerged from these efforts is an impressive map showcasing details about our universe captured through both tools - showing how well each one works together! While there are noticeable imperfections within its construction due its inherent nature , it also demonstrates success! This landmark achievement produced high quality results even though there are some errors present due its unique construction method!
