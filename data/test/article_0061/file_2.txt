This study used ALMA to observe for signs of an interaction between galaxies within an enormous group called El Gordo at great distance (very early in cosmic history). They found evidence for this interaction through changes in pressure caused by moving gas within its structure - similar to how sound waves move through air when something vibrates nearby - confirming earlier estimates using radio waves and suggesting further research into how galaxies evolve over time could be possible using this method going forward .
