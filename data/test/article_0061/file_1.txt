First use by ALMA to study how galaxies interact with each other through powerful shocks within clusters: A landmark discovery was made using data from ALMI (Atacama Large Millimetersubmillimeter Array), confirming for us for instance that there are large scale changes happening within galaxies due to their interactions which can be seen through high energy radiation coming from them
This is especially important because we are able to see one example so far which happened billions years ago when it was younger than our own solar system!
