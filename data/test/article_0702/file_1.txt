VFTS 016, a massive star similar to our Sun located on the western edge of the 30 Doradus molecular cloud complex, offers a unique example of how data from the VFTS survey can help detect the presence or absence of binary stars (i.e., stellar systems with two stars). Initially observed using the 2dF instrument at the Anglo-Australian Telescope, VFTS 016's spectrum showed it moved in space at a speed that was significantly slower than its average motion within our galaxy.  This unusual speed suggests the presence of a large binary companion, but detailed observations from the FLAMES survey revealed no changes in the star's light over time.  Using this analysis, the presence of a massive companion with a period less than one year is excluded with high confidence (98%). The star is about 120 parsecs (approximately 365 light-years) away from a cluster known as R136 and only about 70 pc away from the less massive NGC 2060.  Because it shows such significant speed differences compared to nearby stars, VFTS 016 is considered a "runaway" starâ€”likely ejected from its birth location due to interactions within a star cluster or a kick from a supernova explosion that occurred in a binary system.  Its spectral analysis indicates a massive evolutionary stage of about 90 million solar masses, suggesting it interacted with even more massive stars in R136. Given R136 is believed to be too young for a supernova explosion, if VFTS 016 originated there, it would provide strong evidence for a runaway star's ejection mechanism.  Investigating the three-dimensional movement of VFTS 016 and other potential runaways discovered through the survey requires high-quality proper motions; this is being addressed by an upcoming project using the Hubble Space Telescope to provide additional information about their location in space.
