Cluster Membership  
Figure 4 displays the radial velocity histograms based on our analysis of Giraffe spectra for 196 potential members of NGC 6253 and 111 for Berkeley 32. In both clusters, the radial velocity distributions show a clear, narrow peak, indicating a small velocity range among members. Our velocity measurements for Berkeley 32 closely match those of known cluster members reported in previous studies. As far as we know, there have not been any radial velocity measurements taken for NGC 6253 before our study, making our findings the first determination of its cluster velocity. It is worth noting that the confirmation rate of actual cluster members is relatively low for both clusters. Figure 5 provides a closer view of the color-magnitude diagram for Berkeley 32, highlighting members identified by radial velocity as red dots. The diagram shows that after excluding non-members, the confirmed member sequence remains wide, suggesting a considerable number of photometric binaries and/or variable reddening. Interestingly, nearly all stars identified as potential blue stragglers that are bluer and brighter than the turn-off are actually found to be non-members.
