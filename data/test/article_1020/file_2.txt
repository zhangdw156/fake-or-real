Cluster Membership  
Figure 4 displays the radial velocity histograms from the analysis of Giraffe spectra for 196 and 111 photometric candidate members of NGC 6253 and Berkeley 32, respectively. In both cases, the radial velocity distributions show a distinct, narrow peak, indicating a low velocity dispersion. Our velocity measurements for Berkeley 32 align well with published velocities of known evolved cluster members. To our knowledge, radial velocity measurements for NGC 6253 have not been carried out previously, making our estimation the first for the cluster's velocity. Notably, the percentage of confirmed members in both clusters is relatively low. A close-up view of the colour-magnitude diagram for Berkeley 32 is provided in Figure 5, with radial-velocity members marked as red dots. The diagram shows that, after excluding non-members, the sequence of confirmed members remains quite wide, suggesting a significant amount of photometric binaries and/or differential reddening. Additionally, we observe that nearly all stars that are bluer and brighter than the turn-off, previously identified as potential blue stragglers belonging to the cluster, are actually non-members.
