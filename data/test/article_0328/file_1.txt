The goal is measuring redshift data from millions of galaxies across various scales within our universe's vast expanse—specifically focusing on clusters and their surrounding structures like filaments and groups—to understand how they evolve over time through cosmic history mapping techniques like two point three point correlation functions
To achieve this goal several specific requirements have been established:
Cluster Members: We need accurate redshift data from at least one million galaxies representing members within these massive groupings known as "clusters," prioritizing their brightest member as our primary target first followed by other members within its radius depending on its redshift value less than or equal too .7 . This process will require about half a million fiber hours under optimal dark sky conditions..
Smaller Clusters: We also aim at obtaining red shift data from around ten thousand galaxy members within smaller cluster structures located outside those with z less than or equal too .7 requiring another half a million fiber hours under optimal dark sky conditions.. These smaller structures can give us valuable insights into how these objects form while also helping us understand if there are any differences between them compared with larger ones.. These smaller clusters are important because they can be very sensitive probes used by cosmologists due their higher density compared with larger ones.. For example we want enough coverage so that we can study them without missing any information that could help scientists make better predictions about how our universe evolved over time.. The required coverage needs an area that's large enough so that it covers everything we want but not so big that it becomes useless due too much noise or interference - which would make it harder than necessary! So what does this mean? It means we need enough space where every part has clear visibility without any major obstructions such as clouds blocking out light...
Additional Requirements:
Vast Coverage: To capture massive clusters effectively, which act as crucial indicators about cosmic evolution, we need surveys covering around seven thousand five hundred square degrees - considered as "contiguous" meaning no gaps between individual patches - allowing scientists access all relevant information across different locations simultaneously; This would allow researchers analyze complex relationships between distant objects in space using sophisticated statistical methods such as two point three point correlation functions...
