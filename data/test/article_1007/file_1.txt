ALMA will lead to significant progress in understanding how galaxies are formed and evolve, especially in their early stages. It will help identify numerous faint galaxies across all ALMA bands. We will be able to measure the distribution of these galaxies in space and their redshifts, as ALMA won't be limited by confusion in any of its bands. It will perform well in following up large-area surveys using bolometer arrays, allowing us to resolve continuum emission and determine redshifts from molecular lines. In a related discussion, Pierre Cox shared new findings on molecular emissions at high redshift and addressed star formation in dark sources observed by the Spitzer satellite, highlighting ALMA's potential for insight into energy sources. Dennis Downes reported long-range imaging of the incredibly bright galaxy Arp 220 and concluded that the activity of its active galactic nucleus predominates, contrary to earlier theories that prioritized star formation. Sergio Martin and Daniel Espada claimed that the detailed chemical attributes of star formation in nearby galaxies and the Galactic Center will be a crucial subject for ALMA investigation, as will the link between chemical richness and primary activities in galactic centers. Using a model of molecular emissions, Sergio suggested that Arp 220's power supply might result from a surge of massive star formation, akin to the hot core phase seen in regions where stars form in the Milky Way.
