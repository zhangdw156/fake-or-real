ALMA will lead to significant progress in understanding how galaxies form and evolve, especially in their early stages. It will be able to detect very faint galaxies in all of its frequency bands. The distribution of these galaxies in space and redshift, along with their brightness characteristics, will be measurable because ALMA will not be limited by background noise. It will perform well as a follow-up tool for large surveys conducted with bolometer arrays, both by clarifying ongoing emissions and by obtaining redshifts through molecular lines. In this setting, Pierre Cox shared new findings on high redshift molecular emissions and discussed star formation in obscured sources found by the Spitzer satellite, highlighting ALMA's role in clarifying the nature of these power sources. Dennis Downes showcased high-resolution images of the ultraluminous galaxy Arp 220 and concluded that the activity from its active galactic nucleus largely determines its energy output, contradicting earlier theories that emphasized star formation. Sergio Martin and Daniel Espada suggested that understanding the detailed chemistry of star formation in nearby galaxies and in the Galactic Centre will be a key focus for ALMA, as will examining how chemical complexity relates to the dominant processes occurring in galactic nuclei. Based on his model of molecular emissions, Sergio proposed that the power source in Arp 220 might stem from a surge of massive star formation, akin to the hot core phase seen in regions of star formation in our galaxy.
