The results presented indicate that high-quality spectroscopic data can be collected, comparable to the VVDS and zCOSMOS datasets, leading to about a 90% success rate in measuring redshifts for targeted galaxies. This is achievable by using Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) masks with shorter slits and stare mode observations, regardless of the spectral wavelength. By using slits that are typically half the length of those used for jittered observations, it allows for twice as many slits on any VIMOS MOS mask. To maximize this benefit, a sufficiently large initial sample of target galaxies is needed: experience from VVDS and zCOSMOS shows that maximum slit capacity is reached only if the initial target sample has at least twice the number of objects per VIMOS quadrant as the maximum slit number. This is usually met in deep extragalactic spectroscopic surveys, with both the VVDS and zCOSMOS having target densities two to three times greater than the maximum number of short slits possible on VIMOS masks. The VIPERS survey is the first project using this new observing approach and data reduction technique. Based on the MOS masks for the initial observation period, it is estimated that the survey can spectroscopically observe 60% of the defined galaxy sample from the complete photometric catalog, compared to only about 32% with a typical jittered mask design under the same telescope time allocation. This improved efficiency will significantly enhance the final survey sample and the expected scientific outcomes. Additionally, the overall capability of the ESO community to conduct large spectroscopic surveys efficiently will improve with planned replacements of the VIMOS CCDs, which will yield spectra with fewer fringing residuals in the red wavelength range compared to current CCDs. The new reduction method, using data from these updated CCDs, is anticipated to produce final one-dimensional spectra with consistent noise levels across the entire wavelength range of the VIMOS grisms. This improvement, alongside the increased quantum efficiency in the red part of the spectrum from the new CCDs, is expected to enhance the overall efficiency of VIMOS-based redshift surveys for faint astronomical targets by two to three times.
