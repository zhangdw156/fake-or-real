To analyze how stars move within galaxies, researchers used sophisticated techniques on data gathered from a telescope called TIMER which showed detailed information about star movements across different areas within space at high resolution making them ideal for studying star motion at various scales .
They found evidence for two things: first their observations confirmed what they already suspected about some parts inside a galaxy; second they discovered something unexpected - the shape inside one particular part was not what was expected based on previous knowledge which means there may be new discoveries happening all around us!
