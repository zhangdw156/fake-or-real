The search for faint red giant branch stars within our galaxy's outer regions faces challenges due its low density distribution across space requiring extensive surveying efforts using various techniques like Gaia data analysis alongside ground-based observations like those from telescopes like 4MOST which can measure their positions accurately along with their motions as well as spectral properties that help determine their distance based on light absorption patterns etc.. In order achieve this ambitious project which requires significant resources it involves selecting potential candidates based upon existing data regarding their positions motions combined with additional observations through telescopes such as ground-based imaging surveys spectroscopy aimed towards identifying specific types including those residing within known galactic streams where contamination levels could reach up to 7 . To account for this potential contamination an expansive field coverage spanning over enough space both North South around -8 latitude would allow scientists access into different parts where they can collect sufficient sample size that allows them compare different types within each region thus allowing them make accurate conclusions about dark matter distribution throughout our galaxy .
