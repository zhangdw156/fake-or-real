While we can't actually see them directly due to their nature as "black" objects completely absorbing all light within their grasps called "event horizons", scientists have devised ways to detect their presence through observing how much they deflect nearby light sources before they escape into space...
This allows us to indirectly comprehend what these cosmic behemoths might look like if observed directly! By studying theoretical models based on Einstein's theories about gravity how it bends light around massive objects like Black Holes...
Some scientists have created computer simulations showing how these colossal objects emit rings or halos when surrounded by hot gas drawn into them via intense gravity – something akin to supermassive fruit-infused smoothies! This phenomenon produces distinctive patterns due primarily because photons get bent around these dense objects – hence creating those mesmerizing rings we call 'shadows'.
The sizes brightness variations within these 'signatures' are influenced mainly due factors such as mass rotation rate - think about it like squeezing citrus fruits together; It creates different sized rinds depending upon various factors - just imagine them being squeezed together under immense pressure!
These researchers believe powerful technology such as Very Long Baseline Interferometry may allow us someday even observe evidence behind those shadows - Imagine catching glimpses into those cosmic giants through powerful telescopes designed specifically for this purpose!
