Black holes are invisible but we can detect light near their boundary called "event horizon." This allows us to see what lies beyond them; however they don't appear naked because they have immense gravity which pulls matter nearby forming glowing discs called accretion disks around them
Scientists have simulated how these disks behave under different conditions: some calculations showed how stars would appear behind or near these objects due to light bending around them while others explored how visible emissions might emerge based on how material interacts with photons when approaching or passing through an object's event horizon
A key idea proposed was that if an accretion disk surrounding this object were thin enough it could produce visible rings due to emitted photons interacting with its surface - this phenomenon could potentially be detected using sophisticated radio telescopes like Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).
