The MMT made significant efforts to equip its 6-meter telescope with a Deformable Secondary Mirror (DSM), which was designed and produced by an Italian group that includes MicroGate, ADS Intl, and the Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri. This same group is now working on developing two DSMs for the Large Binocular Telescope at Mount Graham. The technology has advanced considerably, leading to an investigation into its potential for the VLT. A feasibility study started in June 2005, with MicroGate as the lead contractor, alongside ADS and OAA. The goal was to show that this design could work for one of the VLT's 8-meter telescopes. The study concluded positively in August 2005, providing a data package that covered key design aspects. During the feasibility study, it became clear that the project needed to be expanded to address fundamental questions: What scientific benefits would this improvement bring to the UT? What would be the impacts on various systems for the UT and its operation? A conceptual design review was held in September 2005 to explore these questions, involving several ESO staff and external reviewers. The outcome was favorable and was later supported by ESO management as a high-priority project, alongside an endorsement from the STC in October. In December, the ESO Council officially approved the AOF, granting final approval for the project.
