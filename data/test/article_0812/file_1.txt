BACHES – A Small, Lightweight Echelle Spectrograph for Amateur Astronomy

BACHES is an affordable, lightweight echelle spectrograph designed for observing bright stars with small telescopes up to 35 cm in diameter. It achieves a resolving power of 19,000 over a continuous spectral range from 390 to 750 nm. The instrument's total throughput, including the telescope and detector, reaches a peak of 11% at 500 nm. This efficiency allows for the collection of spectra from stars of visual magnitude 5 with a 15-minute exposure time and a signal-to-noise ratio of 50. One aim of the instrument is to track the spectral changes in Balmer emission lines of Be stars. The availability of essential components like diffraction gratings and high-sensitivity CCD cameras at low prices has made it possible to build affordable, high-performance spectrographs. Many amateur astronomers now regularly capture spectra of planets, stars, comets, and bright extended objects. Several years ago, we began creating low-resolution spectrographs for small telescopes. These earlier models were heavy and bulky, requiring optical fibers to connect to the telescope. The first prototype, FIASCO, used a 200 µm fiber attached to a 25-cm telescope with a Peltier-cooled CCD camera and a 600 l/mm grating, yielding spectra with a resolving power of 600. Even with this setup, we detected sodium lines in the comets Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp in 1996 and 1997. Currently, the amateur spectroscopy community is seeking higher resolving power for more ambitious scientific endeavors, such as studying the spectral variability of Balmer emission lines in Be stars and even discovering exoplanets. In response to this trend, we designed an echelle spectrograph light enough to attach directly to small telescopes. The weight limit is 2 kg (excluding the CCD camera), and the size should be compatible with typical amateur telescopes. By using cost-effective echelle gratings and lightweight CCD cameras, we met these goals. The instrument was developed through collaboration between a group from ESO and the Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik's mechanical workshop for apprentices in Garching. The first observations with BACHES took place in September 2006, focusing on bright stars like Albireo and Deneb using a 35-cm Celestron telescope. In March 2007, we began observing Be stars, primarily z Tau.
