The GRAVITY instrument was designed specifically to study gravity near Sagittarius A, our galaxy's central black hole (SGR_A), using stellar orbits as probes within this intense gravitational environment . This research aims to detect how general relativity affects these stellar motions beyond what's predicted by classical mechanics . Observations have shown evidence for intense bursts called "flares" occurring near or around some regions surrounding Sagittarius _A_, which could offer further insights into understanding gravity at extremely high densities where it becomes particularly complex . Data gathered about both stars has allowed scientists to calibrate their instruments effectively , enabling them to make accurate measurements about how gravity behaves at such extreme locations . This research offers valuable information about our understanding of general relativity through studying these powerful astrophysical phenomena .
