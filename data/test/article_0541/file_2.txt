A selection of extremely metal-poor stars was made using a method that considers both their brightness and chemical composition based on data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This process included identifying the most metal-poor objects visually and then observing a subset of the most promising candidates with high resolution. The study resulted in 20 targets for further observation, utilizing UVES and X-shooter spectrographs mounted at the Kueyen VLT Unit Telescope.  An additional round of observations was requested to study one particularly interesting candidate star, which showed unique features in its spectrum, particularly strong calcium lines. This request provided higher resolution data for this particular star, leading to more detailed analysis. The three available spectra (SDSS, UVES, and X-shooter) confirmed the metallicity determination from the SDSS data, indicating extreme metal deficiency across all the selected stars.  A small discrepancy was found between the high-resolution and low-resolution measurements (around 0.5 dex), but overall the lower metallicity obtained with the SDSS spectra was verified.
