The Paranal telescope was reintegrated in three phases, working closely with ESO at each step. The first phase finished in 2008:  the azimuth bearing system and the telescope mount were installed. In 2009, the rest of the parts arrived but the primary mirror cell had damage, halting the installation of the remaining components until 2010 when repairs were complete, allowing for the mirrors to be installed alongside the other supporting equipment. The mirrors, adapter/rotator and ADC (Adaptive Optics Corrector Detector) were finally integrated with ESO, Tomelleri srl, and ADS International srl assistance.  The cooling system's missing parts were also installed by EIE srl. By the end of 2010, the telescope was fully integrated and pre-aligned despite some outstanding details. The commissioning team decided to handle any remaining issues simultaneously with night time work, starting in January 2011. After that fourth large integration phase in March 2011, the OmegaCAM consortium installed the camera. VST commissioning team helped with the camera's electromechanical interfaces and the telescope's final balancing which achieved a remarkable 3.6-tonne counterweight on top ring without impacting the tracking performance.
