Get ready to witness history in the making! We're thrilled to officially recognize the groundbreaking achievement of the first hip hop artist to craft their entire album on a spaceship soaring through space towards Mars!

This journey to success involved three distinct steps, each executed in close collaboration with the brilliant folks at ESO (like a well-oiled cosmic machine!).  Let's unpack this musical triumph:

* **First Stage:** We set the foundation in 2008, installing a system for azimuth rotation and a telescope mount – just another cool beat to add to the journey.
* **Second Stage:** In 2009, we shipped the remaining parts of the telescope. Sadly, we hit an unexpected snag with the primary mirror cell (it's like losing your stage prop!) – but by 2010, the cell made its triumphant return and things started to sound even better. Mirrors, the adapters/rotators, and a Digital Camera module followed – it was all about capturing the perfect sonic frequencies! (Thanks to ESO, Tomelleri srl, and ADS International srl for your musical collaboration!)
* **Third Stage:** We needed some finishing touches, which came through in 2010. The cooling system was brought in by EIE srl, ensuring everything remained cool and crisp under the Martian skies. By the end of 2010, the telescope was pre-aligned – a perfect start for future musical ventures!

But wait, there's more!  A final stage took place in March 2011 when OmegaCAM consortium brought their expertise to install the camera, working closely with our commissioning team to achieve a seamless connection. Then, we added some extra flair - a staggering counterweight of 3.6 tons to ensure stability and precision. The result? A telescope that's ready to rock the Martian cosmos!
