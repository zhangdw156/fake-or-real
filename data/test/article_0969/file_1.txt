Finding suitable candidates for major ground-based astronomy projects is a complex task, with many factors beyond scientific performance sometimes complicating decisions. How can we ensure that no high-potential areas are overlooked? Additionally, project completion timelines are often compressed due to competition for funding and scientific results, which means that the site characterization phase before site selection is frequently reduced to just 12 to 24 months. This raises concerns about whether this relatively short testing period accurately reflects the long-term characteristics of the studied areas. Over the next three years, more than 10 locations will be fully characterized by various ELT groups globally. Care has been taken to use instruments that, while not always identical, are very similar and are consistently cross-calibrated, allowing the accumulated data to be combined and compared among all institutions. FriOWL will enable the evaluation of how candidate sites may be affected by climate change. It is also possible to use FriOWL to verify whether previous astronomical sites were chosen effectively. In Figure 1, cloud cover data from the VLT site survey period has been placed within a longer time frame available in FriOWL, demonstrating its capability to identify climate anomalies. In this figure, the area around Paranal shows low anomalies, while the Amazon basin was 10% clearer than normal, and the north-west continent was up to 10% cloudier. The current spatial resolution of FriOWL is adequate for analyzing climatic variations associated with large-scale weather patterns (e.g., high and low pressure systems). Conversely, the longer time coverage from ERA-40 is necessary for a more accurate assessment of variability.
