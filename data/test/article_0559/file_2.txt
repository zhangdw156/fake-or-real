The current understanding of how massive stars die is blurry and leaves numerous questions unanswered. We're struggling to pinpoint: what exactly are the stars that exploded before becoming supernovae, and how do factors like rotation, metallicity, and binary interactions affect their final form? Existing theories struggle to explain why so many different types of supernovas (CC SNe) exist within the same general family. This difficulty is compounded by our inability to directly observe the massive stars that explode as supernovae before they die - a process we call pre-explosion imaging. We simply lack the technology to see these explosions in their early stages, leaving us with only a handful of near-by examples for study. 

Adding fuel to the fire, this uncertainty extends to how precisely we can pinpoint the exact cause of SN Ia explosion and even understand the different variations found within them (which have been showing up more often lately).  Is it just a different way of classifying things? Are these variations part of something larger with a deeper reason for their existence, similar to how the diverse galaxies in our universe are all interconnected by a grander force?

It's important to remember that standard candles, which use SN Ia as reference points to determine distances, rely on the assumption that all SNe Ia have almost identical properties across cosmic time. However, recent research has revealed intriguing anomalies, with about 50% of observed SNe Ia showing unexpected variations (more complex than we initially thought). We've even encountered new sub-types of SNe Ia! The true nature of these changes and whether they represent distinct physical groups from regular SNe Ia remains a mystery.

The key to unlocking these mysteries lies in the relationship between supernova properties and the parent stellar population. This understanding will guide our investigations into how star formation, galaxy evolution, metallicity, and other factors influence the diversity of supernovae.  For instance, there's intriguing evidence suggesting that subluminous SNe Ia tend to occur more frequently in massive galaxies where star formation is uncommon (i.e., they are less active), while super-luminous SN Ia seem to be tied more closely with environments marked by low metal content. 

Understanding how and when massive stars die helps us unravel the mysteries of their progenitors. This involves studying how star formation rates, the rate of cataclysmic events (CC SNe), and the initial mass distribution within a given galaxy affect these stellar deaths.  Additionally, the SN Ia rate in different galaxies provides insight into the overall evolution of those specific galaxies as it reflects the entire history of star formation. The longer delay between the birth of a SN Ia progenitor and its final death helps us understand how long-lived stars are affected by their environments. We are essentially working backwards from these deaths to decipher what led them down that path.

Just like looking at a large puzzle, piecing together the picture of supernovae requires us to examine different aspects of stellar evolution: their births, deaths, and everything in between.  These pieces, when combined, offer us a more complete view of the diversity and dynamic nature of these spectacular events.
