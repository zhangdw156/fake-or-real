The rates of sulphur obtained were combined with zinc levels measured from the Zn lines at 472.2 and 481.1 nm. Both sulphur (S) and zinc (Zn) do not easily bind to dust in the interstellar medium, making them important for understanding metal enrichment in remote galaxies, especially those seen as damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) in high-redshift quasar spectra. If sulphur behaves similarly to other α-capture elements and zinc follows iron (Fe), the S/Zn ratio acts as an estimate of the timeline for star formation in DLAs. It has been suggested that a solar S/Zn ratio shows that Type Ia supernovae (SNe) contributed to chemical enrichment, implying a DLA system with S/Zn similar to the solar ratio is over a billion years old. However, before confirming this, it is essential to investigate the S/Zn trend among Galactic stars. The trend of [S/Zn] notably hinges on the assumption of non-local thermal equilibrium (LTE) or local thermal equilibrium effects; when non-LTE corrections are applied, there is an overall drop in [S/Zn] for nearly all [Zn/H] values except the highest considered. Additionally, non-LTE effects greatly dominate at low metallicities, leading to [S/Zn] reverting to solar levels when [Zn/H] is below –2. This pattern is atypical, but due to our still limited grasp on zinc nucleosynthesis, it can't be disregarded. Based on this straightforward interpretation, the absence of a strong relationship between metallicity suggests there are limits to using the S/Zn ratio as a time marker for the star-formation history. Further clarification to the reliability of these non-LTE calculations is necessary, as they significantly rely on the uncertain cross-section for collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms that generally support an LTE distribution. Upcoming observations of the forbidden sulphur line at 1.082 µm in cool halo giants should provide valuable insights, as this line is formed close to LTE in such stars—meaning most sulphur atoms are in the lower energy state. Consequently, the upper energy state’s atom count is collisional rather than based on radiative changes. Although the forbidden line is weak, high-resolution measurements through CRIRES will allow precision at metallicities as low as [Fe/H] ~ –2.5.
