The measured sulphur levels were combined with zinc levels found from the Zn lines at 472.2 and 481.1 nm. Both sulphur and zinc are among the few elements that do not easily stick to dust in the interstellar medium. This makes them important for studying metal enrichment in distant galaxies, especially those seen as damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) in high-redshift quasar spectra. If sulphur behaves like other α-capture elements and zinc behaves like iron, the S/Zn ratio can be used to estimate the duration of star formation in DLAs. It has been suggested that a solar S/Zn ratio means that Type Ia supernovae have contributed to the chemical enrichment, implying that a DLA system with a solar-like S/Zn ratio is at least one billion years old. However, before drawing this conclusion, it's important to clarify the trend of [S/Zn] among Galactic stars. The trend of [S/Zn] is significantly influenced by whether local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is assumed. When non-LTE corrections are applied, there is an overall decline in [S/Zn] except at the highest [Zn/H] levels considered here. Moreover, non-LTE effects are most pronounced at low metallicities, suggesting that [S/Zn] returns to solar levels when [Zn/H] < –2. This behavior is unusual but, given the current limited understanding of zinc nucleosynthesis, cannot be ruled out. If taken at face value, the lack of a strong metallicity trend suggests that the S/Zn ratio's usefulness as a ‘clock’ for star-formation history is quite limited. The remaining question is about the accuracy of the non-LTE calculations, which rely heavily on the uncertain cross-section for inelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms that tend to promote an LTE distribution of energy levels. Future observations of the forbidden sulphur line at 1.082 µm in cool halo giants could be particularly valuable for this issue. This line forms close to LTE in cool stars, as most sulphur atoms are in the lower energy level, with the number in the upper level determined by collisions rather than radiative transitions. Although the forbidden line is very weak, the precision and high resolution of CRIRES will allow for accurate measurements at metallicities as low as [Fe/H] ~ –2.5.
