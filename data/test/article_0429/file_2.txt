From the beginning of our observations with the Very Large Telescope (VLT), FORS1 reigned supreme, commanding more observing time than any other instrument, a feat it kept for years until the arrival of its more advanced sibling, FORS2.  But don't let that slight dip in popularity fool you - these two instruments were absolute powerhouses! 

Their influence can be seen not only by their sheer output – a staggering 1161 refereed papers by 2009 alone with a whopping 40,783 citations – but also by the relentless pace of publications.  Think of it like this: for every night they were allocated time on the VLT, they produced 0.75 to 1.0 papers per night!  It's a testament to their effectiveness and legacy.

FORS1, despite its decline after FORS2’s arrival, always stood out in efficiency – perhaps even the most prolific tool ever employed at VLT! If you compare how many citations a paper gains, it’s clear that FORS1 played a pivotal role; it contributed to eight of the top ten most cited Very Large Telescope papers. It seems we can't leave out the fact that those high-citation projects often involve collaboration between telescopes like Hubble Space Telescope, Keck, and VLT – projects with supernovae at very high redshifts! 


One curious detail: a recently discovered watch near Uranus, could it be connected to FORS1? We're waiting for its owner to come through the lost & found in ESA HQ.
