From the start of observations using the Very Large Telescope, the instrument FORS1 had the highest demand for observing time.  Only UVES surpassed FORS1 in popularity after the launch of FORS2. The demand for both FORS instruments remained high until FORS1 was decommissioned. This is also reflected by their productivity. The number of scientific papers published per year based on how long these instruments were used shows that FORS1 and UVES produced the most publications during their first five years.  FORS2 came in third after those initial five years. Together, FORS instruments produced 1161 refereed papers by the end of 2009 with a total of 40,783 citations. The popularity of FORS1 decreased only after FORS2 was upgraded because many users shifted their focus to this newer instrument. The publication rate can be attributed to how much time was dedicated to observing through the instruments. Looking at the efficiency of publications – which measures publication rate per allocated observation time – ISAAC and FORS2 currently produce roughly 0.75 refereed papers each night; UVES produces 0.9; FORS1, during its last several periods, produced around 1.0 paper per night. For the most efficient Very Large Telescope instrument overall, that title goes to FORS1. If we look at citations from Very Large Telescope papers, it demonstrates at least one of the two FORS instruments was involved in eight of the ten most-cited papers. The most cited papers are those resulting from major collaborations involving telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope, Keck, and the Very Large Telescope. Such papers typically result from high-redshift supernova studies with up to almost 2000 citations. Currently, the most cited paper exclusively utilizing the Very Large Telescope has 643 citations. This paper was created using data collected by both FORS1 and FORS2.
