The formal relationship between ESO and Chile began with the 1963 Convention, which enabled the successful building and operation of the La Silla Observatory. Later, during the construction of the VLT, a new agreement was signed and approved by the Chilean Congress in September 1996. This agreement ensured that Chilean astronomers would have prioritized access to advanced telescopes at La Silla, Paranal, and Chajnantor for deserving research projects. To maximize this scientific opportunity, an annual fund was created to support astronomy and related sciences in Chile. A decade later, ESO published a special book titled “10 Years Exploring the Universe,” which was based on reports from beneficiaries of the annual fund to assess the impact of the various funded projects. The book provides an overview of recent advancements in astronomy in Chile. Since its inception, the ESO-Chile fund has allocated over 2.5 million euros for new post-doctoral and professor positions in astrophysics at leading Chilean universities, the development of research facilities, hosting scientific conferences, workshops for science educators, and public astronomy outreach initiatives. Additionally, ESO contributes 400,000 euros annually to the ESO-Chile Joint Committee and about 550,000 euros each year for regional collaboration programs, student fellowships in Chilean universities, and the advancement of radio astronomy through the ALMA-Chile Committee. Overall, beyond the 10% of observing time at ESO telescopes, ESO invests 950,000 euros yearly in promoting astronomy and scientific culture in Chile. As a result of these funds and other encouraging developments in recent years, the national astronomical community in Chile has expanded rapidly in size and scientific influence. A 2005 study by the Chilean Academy of Sciences observed that the number of astronomers has doubled in the last 20 years, with an eightfold increase in scientific publications. The same study suggested that astronomy might become the first scientific field in Chile to meet the standards of a developed nation, yielding further technological improvements and growth in human resources.
