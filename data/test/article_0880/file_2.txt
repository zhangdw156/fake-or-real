The formal partnership between ESO and Chile began with the Convention of 1963, which facilitated the building and operation of the La Silla Observatory. Later, during the construction of the VLT, a new agreement was signed and approved by the Chilean Congress in September 1996. This agreement ensured that Chilean astronomers would have prioritized access to telescopes at La Silla, Paranal, and Chajnantor for deserving research projects. An annual fund was set up to enhance astronomy and related sciences in the country. Ten years after this initiative started, ESO published a book, based on reports from the annual fund recipients, to highlight the impact of funded projects. Titled “10 Years Exploring the Universe,” the book was launched at ESO Vitacura and summarizes recent advancements in Chilean astronomy. Since its inception, the ESO-Chile fund has allocated over 2.5 million euros for new post-docs and professors at major Chilean universities, research infrastructure, scientific congresses, workshops for teachers, and public outreach programs. In addition to the annual donation of 400,000 euros to the ESO-Chile Joint Committee, around 550,000 euros are provided each year for regional collaboration, university fellowships, and the development of radio astronomy through the ALMA-Chile Committee. Overall, alongside providing 10% of telescope time, ESO contributes 950,000 euros each year for the promotion of astronomy and scientific culture in Chile. As a result of these funds and other supportive developments in recent years, the national astronomical community in Chile has rapidly grown in size and impact. A 2005 study by the Chilean Academy of Sciences found that the number of astronomers has doubled over the past 20 years, with an eightfold increase in scientific publications. This study concluded that astronomy could become the first discipline in Chile to align with the standards of developed countries, bringing additional technological advancements and increased human resources.
