Our samples are perfect for comparing spectra across six orders of magnitude in source brightness. The average composite spectra for six brightness categories (log Lbol = 43 to 49, with Lbol measured in ergs per second) show that there are no brightness correlations in our low redshift samples, which aligns with previous findings that source brightness is unrelated to Eigenvector 1 correlations involving FWHM Hb. Differentiating between Pop. A and B composite spectra is crucial to highlight the most significant changes in Hb. Without this distinction, the only brightness trend we observe is a consistent weakening of narrow emission lines as brightness increases. Although narrow line measurements are not included in the 4DE1 parameter set, this decrease in narrow lines raises questions about whether the trend is due to brightness or redshift (i.e., source evolution). Earlier 4DE1 studies suggested that Pop. A (especially NLSy1) indicates a young quasar group. This perspective is supported by the observation that low redshift NLSy1 sources also have weaker narrow lines. However, the same weakening is also seen in Pop. B composites. We observe a wide range of FWHM Hb measurements across all redshifts, with a clear lower boundary that rises from approximately 500 to 1000 km/s at Lbol = 48 to 49. No significant change is observed in the upper FWHM boundary. The change in the lower boundary is evident in the distribution of FWHM Hb measurements against log Lbol. An increase in minimum FWHM with brightness is anticipated if the broadening of the Hb line results primarily from virial motions and if the emissivity-weighted rBLR varies with brightness according to a power law. The exact value of the index is uncertain, but a stronger trend is expected for a around 0.5, particularly at high brightness. Regardless of the precise value for a, this observed trend is one of the few independent pieces of evidence supporting the idea that the broadening of Balmer lines is mainly due to virial effects. Median spectra indicate that Pop. A sources maintain very similar (Lorentzian) Hb line profiles, while this is not true for Pop. B sources, which show a red asymmetry that increases with source brightness. Evidence suggests that this asymmetry is a separate, redshifted component (referred to as the very broad line region or VBLR). This additional line component poses challenges for both physical models of the BLR and for using FWHM Hb as a virial estimator.
