Our samples are perfect for comparing spectra spanning 6 magnitudes in source brightness. The median composite spectra for six brightness groups (with log Lbol values from 43 to 49, in ergs per second) show that we do not observe any brightness correlations within our low redshift samples, confirming earlier findings that source brightness and Eigenvector 1 correlations tied to FWHM Hb are unrelated. Distinguishing between Pop. A and B composite spectra is important to highlight the main change in Hb. If we do not make this distinction, the only brightness trend we observe is the consistent weakening of narrow emission lines as brightness increases. Although narrow line measures are not included in the 4DE1 parameter set, this decrease raises the question of whether the trend is due to brightness or redshift (source evolution). Earlier 4DE1 research proposed that Pop. A — particularly NLSy1 — reflects a younger quasar group. This idea is supported by our finding of weaker narrow lines in low redshift NLSy1 sources. However, it is unclear why the same weakening is seen in Pop. B composites. We observe significant variation in FWHM Hb measurements across all redshifts, with a clear lower boundary that grows from around 500 to 1000 km/s at Lbol values of 48 to 49. We do not see an observable change in the upper limit of FWHM. This adjustment in the lower boundary can be illustrated by plotting FWHM Hb measurements against log Lbol. An increase in the minimum FWHM connected to rising luminosity is predicted if the broadening of the Hb line primarily stems from virial movements, and if the size of the broad line region (rBLR) related to luminosity follows a power law. Although the precise value of the index remains uncertain, a stronger trend is conjectured for a being around 0.5, especially at higher luminosities. Regardless of the true value of a, this frequent trend is among the few solid pieces of evidence suggesting that the widening of Balmer lines mostly results from virial influences. The median spectra further illustrate that Pop. A sources showcase very similar (Lorentzian) Hb line appearances, opposed to Pop. B sources, which exhibit an increased red asymmetry with rising luminosity. This asymmetry suggests a separate, redshift component (termed the very broad line region or VBLR). The presence of this extra line component poses challenges for both physical models of the broad line region and the application of FWHM Hb for virial estimations.
