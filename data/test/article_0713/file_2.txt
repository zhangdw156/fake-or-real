The spectra of pen ray lamps filled with Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe have been measured at a spectral resolution similar to that of the X-shooter NIR, as well as at varying resolutions to examine line blending. The relative intensities of the lamps were calculated as an integral of the line fluxes. The Ne, Ar, and Kr lamps have intensities that are within a factor of three of each other, while Xe is three times fainter than the next dimmest source. A reliable calibration spectrum cannot be created from any two lamps together. However, combining Ne, Ar, and Kr results in a suitable spectrum for X-shooter calibration in the NIR, fulfilling the requirement of 10 lines per order for all but two orders and nearing the target of 30 lines per order for many orders. Thus, this combination is recommended as a baseline for the calibration unit. Adding Xe will provide only slight improvements in the number of lines and coverage. Given that Xe is the weakest source, its addition's practicality and benefits should be evaluated during laboratory integration and testing. The range between 1880 and 2015 nm lacks lines, complicating potential solutions. This may pose challenges for a dispersion solution based on an empirical polynomial fit. Since X-shooter will use a physical model for wavelength calibration in the pipeline, significant negative impacts on calibration accuracy are not anticipated. The spectrum from a Th-Ar HCL has a less favorable line distribution across the NIR range, and many faint Th lines are blended at X-shooter resolution, making them unsuitable for calibration. These results should be thoroughly verified during X-shooter testing and commissioning, but they will also assist in optimizing and expediting laboratory tests by providing quantitative predictions about the calibration lamps' performance. This will alleviate pressure during the busy testing and commissioning phases. Our new approach offers future instrument developments a way to estimate and refine the performance of a calibration system while still in the design phase.
