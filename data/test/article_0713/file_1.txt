The spectra of pen ray lamps filled with Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe were measured at the same spectral resolution as the X-shooter NIR and at varying other resolutions to examine line blending. The lamp intensities were calculated as an integral of the line fluxes. The intensities of the Ne, Ar, and Kr lamps are within a factor of three of one another, while Xe is another three times dimmer than the next faintest lamp. No effective calibration spectrum can be made from any two-lamp combination. However, combining Ne, Ar, and Kr gives an acceptable spectrum for X-shooter calibration in the NIR, achieving the requirement of 10 lines per order in nearly all cases and achieving close to the target of 30 lines per order in several instances. This combination is recommended as a standard for the calibration unit's implementation. Adding Xe would yield only marginal improvements in line quantity and coverage. Given that Xe is the faintest source, its value should be considered during laboratory tests and integrations. The interval from 1880 to 2015 nm lacks many lines, making it a challenging scenario to address. An empirical polynomial fit may struggle with this situation. Since the X-shooter will utilize a physical model for pipeline wavelength calibration, we do not expect significant accuracy issues. The Th-Ar HCL spectrum displays a less advantageous line distribution across the NIR range, and its faint lines blend at X-shooter resolution, making them unusable for calibration. Further verification of our results is needed during the X-shooter testing and commissioning stages. Still, our findings may help enhance and accelerate laboratory processes by providing quantitative insights into the calibration lamps' performance, easing the strain on testing and commissioning phases. For future instruments, our new strategy allows estimation and optimization of calibration system performance during the design phase.
