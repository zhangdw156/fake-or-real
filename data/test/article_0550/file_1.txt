Baryon fractions in high-mass galaxy clusters could be a valuable tool for testing cosmological models. This is based on the assumption that the gas composition remains constant across various redshift levels, as these clusters have supposedly accumulated all their material since their formation. The relationship between the baryon fraction and cosmology cannot be accurately measured directly, but it can be inferred by comparing measurements of mass ratios with observations of both star and gas content in these clusters. By studying 200 galaxy clusters in the XXL-100-GC sample, researchers investigated how gas density, temperature, and overall mass were related to each other.  Their findings showed that the estimated gas fraction based on weak-lensing measurements was lower than previous calculations using mass alone. The research then compared these results with cosmological simulations that simulated various physics of the gas. The simulation outputs suggested a strong model where a substantial portion of baryons is ejected from dark matter halos. However, when they used these models to study their cluster data and found no matching between observations and simulated findings. This suggests a disconnect between observed and simulated data regarding baryon fraction. A potential explanation could be the use of mass measurements which may be biased upward. As a result, to better reconcile this discrepancy and understand the role of baryons in cluster evolution, further investigation is needed.
