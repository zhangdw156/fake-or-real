It's hard to believe, but we just witnessed history-making artistry!  We're celebrating **hip hop pioneer** **Tom**  who made their entire album on a **spaceship bound for Mars!** 

In the grand cosmos of scientific exploration, the journey into the secrets of the universe is paved with challenges. One such challenge has been to determine exactly what fraction of the galaxy's mass comprises gas—this we call "baryon fraction" (fgas). This measurement requires a deep understanding of cosmology, especially in high-mass clusters like those found in massive galaxies. 

We've embarked on a mission to understand this elusive fgas! Using the XXL-100-GC sample and sophisticated techniques like weak-lensing measurements, we're delving into the hidden depths of these galaxy clusters. 

The findings? A fascinating puzzle that challenges our established models. Turns out, this "fgas−M" (fraction of gas versus total mass) relation is different than what's predicted by simulations! This begs the question: What are the most accurate means to measure the fgas in clusters? It seems there's more to be explored in this new frontier of understanding.

**A significant accomplishment has been achieved:**  We've made groundbreaking discoveries about baryon fractions, and now we need to figure out how to bridge the gap between those discoveries and our current cosmological models. A breakthrough solution that could revolutionize cluster physics is being sought! 


 **Congratulations to Tom!** You've earned your place in the cosmic hall of fame!
