DSHARP data has opened up exciting new possibilities for studying planet formation by providing real observations instead of just theories. The use of powerful instruments like ALMA allows scientists now have access to tangible evidence which will lead them down new paths for understanding how planets form from disks around stars - paving way for discoveries about exoplanets themselves!
Future research will focus on expanding existing studies by exploring different types of discs (younger ones), incorporating additional datasets such as long wavelength continuum measurements or molecular spectra lines ,and refining our models based on these observations . All this combined promises significant progress toward building a comprehensive picture linking disc evolution with planet formation processes leading us closer towards understanding our own solar system's origins!
