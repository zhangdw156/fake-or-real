The "Granulation" project aims at mapping approximately one thousand square degrees within two nearby galaxies called "the Large And Small Magellanic clouds". It seeks out various types - young massive or supergiant star clusters - and those located at varying ages or chemical compositions - including red giants or horizontal branch star clusters - . To achieve this goal it uses several tools like:
Gaia: Provides precise measurements based upon parallax shifts which help differentiate between galactic objects like our own sun versus objects within our neighboring galaxy; this allows us further refine object location accuracy..
VISTA: Utilizing near infrared observation techniques helps pinpoint specific target locations; its findings complementing earlier work done by other surveys like VMS surveys targeting specific areas..
This comprehensive approach provides valuable information regarding:
Substructure: Examining how these objects form groups based upon their age or chemical composition.. This helps us understand how they formed over time..
In summary this project seeks detailed information about these celestial bodies through targeted observations across various wavelengths using multiple telescopes allowing researchers better understanding their evolution over time..
