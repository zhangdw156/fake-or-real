The "The Hundred Thousand Stars Survey" aims at mapping out over one thousand square degrees within two nearby galaxies called our own Milky Way's neighborhood – the Large Small Magellenic clouds – using various telescopes like Gaias radial velocity spectrograph or even ones like Vistas near infrared camera or APOGEEs telescope .
This ambitious project focuses on gathering detailed information about over half million star spectra: from faint blue giants down below our solar system's sun all up into brighter red supergiants; covering ages ranging through young massive star clusters down into old Red Giant Stars .
To achieve this goal they utilize multiple techniques including combining near infrared observations by Vista other telescopes like OGLE Gaia which specifically identify variables such as Cepheid Variables , Long Period Variables ,and RR Lyrae Stars .
They aim at understanding not only individual star properties but also how they relate spatially across these massive structures known as Substructures . This includes studying their composition through chemical analysis along their evolution towards older stages such as horizontal branches or asymptotic giants , making it one big picture puzzle!
By carefully selecting these target based on criteria like parallax measurements using GAIA they hope this investigation can provide valuable insights into how these galaxies evolved over time - what caused them? What kind? And how did they change along its lifespan?
