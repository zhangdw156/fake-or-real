We intentionally chose not to publish printed proceedings for this workshop. Instead, we provided immediate online access to all contributions, both oral and poster, shortly after the workshop concluded, with the authors' consent. We believed that quick access to the research shared during the event was more beneficial than waiting for printed proceedings in a fast-moving field where results change rapidly and will appear in peer-reviewed journals. We also offered a live-stream webcast during the conference as an additional way to provide timely access to the material discussed. The savings from not printing proceedings were invested in creating an attractive program and supporting some participants’ travel to Chile. Approximately 40% of the participants received financial aid; half were students and half researchers, with all students having their registration fees waived. We thank ESO for providing financial support for this workshop and acknowledge everyone who contributed to its success, especially our librarian who served as secretary, the ESO-Chile administration for logistical assistance, and the students from Universidad Católica de Chile for their help during the four-day event, particularly with registration. The excellent local organization, well-received coffee breaks, social gatherings, and the conference dinner created a warm and friendly atmosphere that all participants appreciated. While similar high-quality meetings are common in many research institutes in Europe and North America, ESO Vitacura has not had this experience, and we look forward to organizing more workshops like this in the future.
