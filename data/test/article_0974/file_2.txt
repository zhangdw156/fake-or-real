We intentionally chose not to publish printed proceedings for this workshop. Instead, we provided immediate online access to all presentations and poster contributions after the event, with the authors' permission. We believed that instant access to key research findings was more beneficial than waiting for printed materials, especially in a fast-paced field where results quickly evolve and are published in refereed journals. To enhance this concept, we also offered a live-stream webcast of the conference as a trial. Additionally, we believe the cost savings allowed us to create an engaging program and financially support some participants' travel to Chile, with approximately 40% receiving assistance. Half of those supported were students, who did not pay the registration fee. We appreciate ESO for providing funding for this workshop and want to thank everyone who contributed to its success, especially our librarian who acted as secretary, ESO-Chile's administration for logistical assistance, and the students from Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile who helped during registration over the four days. The excellent local organization, outstanding coffee breaks, social events, and conference dinner created a welcoming and friendly atmosphere, which all participants cherished. While events of this quality and size occur often in research institutions in Europe and North America, ESO Vitacura does not commonly host such gatherings, and we look forward to future workshops like this on our premises.
