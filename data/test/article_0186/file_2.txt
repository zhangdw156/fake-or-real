Adding Atacama Large Millimetersubmillimeter Array (ALAMA) significantly enhanced Earth Observatory Telescope's capabilities by improving its sensitivity significantly exceeding previous detection limits by over an order magnitude .
Here's how:
Increased Sensitivity: By using ARAMA as part their combined system it led to much stronger signals that were easier detected even when they were faint or obscured by weather conditions like storms or bad light exposure . It was possible because it provided very low noise readings compared to other telescopes like APEX nearby
Improved Baseline Coverage: Its strategic placement within Earth Observatory Telescope allowed it capture better images due its ability cover longer distances between individual telescopes leading better imaging quality overall
Accurate Flux Density Measurements: By combining data from both telescopes ,they have been able create detailed measurements about how much energy each object emits along different polarizations which helps them understand their structure better
Overall , this partnership made Earth Observatory Telescope more powerful than ever before allowing astronomers access information previously unobtainable . This collaboration allowed them make discoveries about celestial objects that would have otherwise been impossible due limitations without these advanced tools .
