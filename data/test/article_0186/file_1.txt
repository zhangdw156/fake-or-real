The addition made by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope significantly boosted EarthSky Telescope's ability due its advanced features like large aperture size allowing it capture faint signals from space objects better than ever before . It provided several crucial benefits including increased sensitivity allowing them detect weaker signals harder previously impossible tasks like detecting faint objects that were hidden behind clouds or distant galaxies . This was achieved thanks to its precise measurements , enabling researchers gain deeper insights into celestial phenomena . Additionally , it allowed them measure accurately how much light different celestial bodies emit , improving their understanding about how they evolved over time . Finally , they were able use this information together with their existing knowledge about celestial mechanics leading them towards new discoveries about our universe .
