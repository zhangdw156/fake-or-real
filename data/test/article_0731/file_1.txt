Spain is set to join the European Southern Observatory (ESO). On February 1, an agreement was signed in Madrid by the Spanish Minister of Education and Science, confirming Spain's commitment to becoming a member. After receiving approval from the Spanish Council of Ministers and ratification by the Spanish Parliament of the ESO Convention and related protocols, Spain will officially become ESO's twelfth member on July 1, 2006. The Spanish Minister noted that joining ESO was a logical and necessary decision for Spain, which ranks eighth in astrophysical research. Large scientific facilities are essential for various research fields and also support high-tech companies, enhancing research and development funding. The ESO Director General expressed excitement about Spain's membership, highlighting that it allows ESO to leverage Spain's unique scientific and technological expertise. Spain has made significant advancements in astronomy over the past thirty years and is a vital player in the European astronomical community, hosting key research facilities like the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos at La Palma, which includes the nearly completed 10-meter GranTeCan telescope. Spain's outstanding astronomical research and technological capabilities justify its membership in ESO. Through this membership, Spain will gain full access to ESO's existing facilities and participate freely in future projects. Spain is already involved with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), which is constructed and operated by ESO for Europe. Spain's admission was approved by ESO's Council at its meeting in Garching on December 7 and 8, 2005.
