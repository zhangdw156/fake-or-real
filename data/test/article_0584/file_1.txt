The TAROT telescope network has played a significant role in Gravitational Wave Astronomy (GRB) since 1998. Its greatest contribution has been its ability to monitor the first few minutes of optical emission from Gamma-ray bursts. The initial objectives have been fully accomplished, and over thirty research papers have been published using data from TAROT. While TAROT will continue investigating GRB, researchers are also preparing for the advancement of multi-messenger astronomy, with a focus on neutrinos. 

TAROT is linked to the ANTARES experiment, which utilizes lines of photomultipliers deep beneath the Mediterranean Sea to detect neutrinos.  It also participated in follow-up efforts triggered by gravitational wave interferometers (LIGO and VIRGO) in 2010. TAROT successfully completed blind tests for this type of data analysis. The next generation of gravitational wave detectors is scheduled to be operational in 2017, and TAROT will contribute to this exciting endeavor.  Meanwhile, TAROT has also served as the foundation for a global network of telescopes that observe fast transient objects from Earth, leading to more complete observations in the field.
