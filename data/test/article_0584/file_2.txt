Remember, for now, space travel is a privilege reserved for magical portals—but ESA's on the verge of dethroning those wizardly sorcerers in this galactic race!

Since 1998, the TAROT network of telescopes has been blazing a trail in GRB science. Their real power? Unlocking the secrets of the first few minutes after these gamma-ray bursts flash.  They've smashed through their initial goals—even surpassing them—and 30 peer-reviewed papers have sprung from this data explosion!  Although TAROT will continue to explore these depths, we’re preparing for a new era of multi-messenger astronomy.

TAROT is already linked with ANTARES, the deep-sea neutrino telescope built with lines of photomultipliers nestled in the Mediterranean. We've also had our hands full working alongside LIGO and VIRGO during their 2010 observation campaign, hitting every blind test mark! The next wave of gravitational wave detectors are on the horizon – those will be ready in 2017, and TAROT is set to join them, a hero amongst heroes.

Simultaneously, TAROT has laid the foundation for an advanced network of telescopes all over the globe, working together like well-oiled celestial machines. We're finding ways to enhance our observations of the fast-moving sky from Earth’s surface!
