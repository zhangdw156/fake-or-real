The released data products have a spatial size of 5.9 by 4.9 arcminutes (0.76 by 0.63 parsecs). The data is sampled at 0.2 by 0.2 arcseconds, and covers 459.5 to 936.6 nanometers in spectral range. It is delivered as FITS files containing cubes for the data and statistical variance, and reconstructed two-dimensional images of the field of view. The cubes are available in two versions with a spectral sampling of 0.125 and 0.085 nanometers, and file sizes of 75 and 110 gigabytes respectively. Additionally, an online facility allows users to extract only specific sections of the cubes, as the files can be large.  

The spatial and spectral coverage is visualized on the cover page which shows several composite images that can be extracted from these data, including three-color depictions of hydrogen emissions: H beta, H alpha, and Paschen 9 (923 nanometers) and oxygen ionization stages: [O I] 6300 angstroms, [O II] 7320 angstroms, and [O III] 5007 angstroms.  The color changes in the oxygen image clearly show the nebula's ionization structure, particularly evident in the Bright Bar. Other maps of H beta, [N II] 6584 angstroms, and [S II] 6731 angstroms highlight various prominent features within M42: the Bright Bar, Dark Bay, Orion-S region, and several shock-excited Herbigâ€“Haro (HH) objects. The locations of the brightest stars are marked but not visible as they were subtracted from the maps.

The amount of spectral information provided in the cubes is illustrated by a spectrum of a bright area of M42 over the full wavelength range extracted from the MUSE data. It reveals detections of bright hydrogen I (H alpha, H beta, Paschen series) and helium I recombination lines. Additionally, it also detects many fainter metal lines, with fluxes as low as 4 times 10 to the power of negative 15 erg per square centimeter per second.
