SDSS J102915 plus 172927 in Leo is a faint star with a low brightness in the ultraviolet (g-band). It has a color typical of a "turn-off" star, and it's estimated to be about 1.3 kiloparsecs away. Its orbit is elongated, placing it in the halo. Due to its small mass, it experiences slow evolution and retains chemical components similar to those found in the interstellar cloud it formed from, which are primarily primordial elements enriched slightly by supernovae ejecta.  Based on several factors such as its age (likely over 13 billion years), radiochronometry, and galactic mixing processes, it's determined to be extremely metal-poor. Its oxygen content is unknown but we assume its lack of carbon and nitrogen makes it unlikely to have high levels of oxygen, so we estimate a metallicity ratio for oxygen to iron (O/Fe) that’s about 0.6 dex higher than typical stellar values. This star’s classification relies on the inclusion of all elements heavier than helium, often measured through the metallicity (Z) parameter, as opposed to just iron content alone, which is used primarily in traditional classifications.  The metallicity for SDSS J102915 plus 172927 is significantly lower than the sun's, suggesting it originated around a similar time and composition to the initial elements created during the Big Bang.
