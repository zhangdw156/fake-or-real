ESO is fully committed to this significant project, which will require around 110 full-time employees over six years. Table 3 outlines the key milestones ahead. The AO Department of ESO is leading the development of the AO Facility, which involves converting one 8-meter utility telescope into an adaptive telescope. This collaboration, which includes European partners, aims to provide the ESO community with: an 8-meter utility telescope equipped with a new M2 unit that has 1,170 actuators for adaptive optics correction; a 4LGS facility that will launch four sodium lasers from the telescope's center; GRAAL, an adaptive optics module for Ground Layer correction for the Hawk-I instrument; GALACSI, an adaptive optics module for Ground Layer correction for MUSE Wide Field and tomographic correction for MUSE Narrow Field; and ASSIST, a sophisticated testing facility for complete performance assessment of the AOF in Europe. The project successfully completed a Conceptual Design Review last September, with Preliminary and Final Design Reviews scheduled for 2007-08. Commissioning activities will be underway during 2010-11, and the AOF should be available to the community by 2012.
