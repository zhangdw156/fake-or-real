ESO is fully committed to this significant project, which will require around 110 full-time employees over six years. Table 3 lists the main upcoming milestones. The AO Department at ESO leads the creation of the AO Facility and the upgrade of one 8-meter unit telescope into an adaptive telescope. This collaborative effort, also involving European partners, aims to provide the ESO community with: an 8-meter telescope equipped with a new M2 unit that includes 1,170 actuators for adaptive optics correction; a 4 laser guide star facility that will launch four sodium lasers from the telescope's center; GRAAL, an adaptive optics module for Ground Layer correction for the Hawk-I instrument; GALACSI, an adaptive optics module for Ground Layer correction for MUSE Wide Field and complicating Tomographic correction for MUSE Narrow Field; and ASSIST, an advanced test bench for the full assessment of AOF performance in Europe. The project successfully completed a Conceptual Design Review last September, with Preliminary and Final Design Reviews scheduled for 2007-08. Commissioning activities are expected to begin in earnest during 2010-11, and the AOF should be ready for the community by 2012.
