The standard model describes a Universe based on Einstein’s theory of general relativity, featuring a key energy density mostly made up of a new component called 'dark energy'. This dark energy gives energy to the vacuum and is distinct from matter and radiation. The other forms of energy include 'cold dark matter', ordinary matter called 'baryonic material', and small amounts of radiation and light neutrinos. While the Universe appears uniform on a grand scale, it has varying densities that likely facilitate the growth of galaxies and large structures. The simplest theory suggesting how these features formed is that the Universe went through an initial period of 'inflation', during which the amount of dark energy was much higher than it is today. This leads to several important questions: (1) What caused the imbalance between baryons and antimatter and what determines the ratio of baryons to photons? (2) What exactly is dark matter—could it be a known massive particle or something entirely different? (3) What is dark energy; is it the same as Einstein's cosmological constant or could it involve changing effects we've yet to observe? (4) Did inflation really occur? Are there signs we can detect from a time when vacuum energy was dominant? (5) Is the current understanding of cosmology a correct interpretation of the Universe's physics? Are phenomenon such as dark energy potentially indicators of different gravitational laws related to extra dimensions, or could fundamental constants actually change?
