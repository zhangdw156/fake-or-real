The standard model describes a Universe based on Einsteinâ€™s theory of general relativity, featuring a critical energy density primarily made up of a new component called 'dark energy', which adds energy to empty space. The rest of the energy includes collisionless 'cold dark matter' and normal 'baryonic' matter, along with small amounts of radiation and light neutrinos. The Universe is mostly uniform on large scales but has a range of irregularities that are thought to have grown due to gravity, contributing to the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures. The simplest explanation for these features is that the Universe experienced an early period of 'inflation', where the dark energy density was much higher than it is today. This context leads to several important questions: (1) What caused the imbalance between baryons and antimatter, and how was the baryon-to-photon ratio determined? (2) What is the nature of dark matter? Is it a leftover massive particle or something different? (3) What is dark energy? Is it Einstein's cosmological constant or a changing phenomenon over time? (4) Did inflation actually occur, and can we find signs of that early energy-dominated stage? (5) Is the standard cosmological model based on correct physics? Are concepts like dark energy simply results of a different gravitational theory that might involve extra dimensions? Could fundamental constants change over time?
