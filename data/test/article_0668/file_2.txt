The KMOS instrument uses a specialized module called the pickoff system to position and collect light from different areas of an image. This system operates using two types of robotic arms with pivoting points, which move around the image field by using motors that are pre-cooled (cryogenically prepared) in vacuum. These arms have been designed to improve access to targets within crowded parts of the picture, all while minimizing interference between the arms themselves. The focal plane, a flat surface where the light is collected and focused, utilizes two specialized lenses for better imaging clarity. This design has undergone extensive testing in a controlled environment, ensuring high repeatability and reliability. 

The pickoff system includes sensors to ensure accurate arm positioning and minimize collisions:  a step-counting mechanism with datum switches, LVDT encoders on each arm, and a collision detection system that detects if two arms come into contact and halts the movement of those specific arms. Precision accuracy for individual arm positions is also available, even at the extremely low temperatures used for most astronomical observations. The arm's positioning is measured by a laser tracker, yielding an accuracy lower than 50 micrometers.  The system contains calibration unit and a filter wheel which adjusts focus between various wavelengths of light. The cold-stop position for each channel is located at the base of the arm, followed by an intermediate image formation using a fixed K-mirror assembly that aligns the pickoff field so their edges are parallel to the sky for efficient image mapping.  This configuration provides for a sparse matrix of arms, allowing the KMOS integral field units (IFUs) to cover a significant area of the sky in 16 different dither points across 65 Ã— 43 arcseconds (or 33 x 16).
