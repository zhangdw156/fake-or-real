Although PDI can provide a lot of information about the inner regions of stellar discs, it hasn't been fully utilized with the VLT's NACO instrument yet. Besides HD100546 and HD97048, only one other stellar disc has been studied with NACO/PDI: TW Hya, which also shows signs of irregularities in its brightness profile. However, NACO is not ideal for PDI studies as it experiences polarization effects that change depending on the viewing angle of the source.  A new instrument, SPHERE, will be installed at the VLT soon. This instrument has PDI capabilities and a high-performance adaptive optics system that will provide better Strehl ratios and stability in point spread function (PSF) compared to NACO. The addition of ZIMPOL — an optical imaging polarimeter with high precision — will offer unprecedented accuracy in measuring polarization and open new possibilities for studying discs from the ground. IRDIS, a NIR double-beam imager with PDI capabilities, complements the data from ZIMPOL by capturing images at longer wavelengths. While VLTI instruments can currently resolve the inner regions at near-infrared and mid-infrared wavelengths, ALMA will probe sub-millimeter thermal emission and molecular gas content in the disc's middle plane. By combining these instruments with SPHERE, we can better understand the structure of stellar discs and gain insights into the physical and chemical conditions under which planets likely form.
