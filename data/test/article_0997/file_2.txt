Most observations of stellar magnetic fields are currently made using three spectropolarimeters. In the northern hemisphere, the high-resolution spectropolarimeter ESPaDOnS is located at the 3.6-meter Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) on Mauna Kea, while its counterpart NARVAL is at the 2-meter Telescope Bernard Lyot on Pic du Midi. Both ESPaDOnS and NARVAL can capture linear and circular polarization spectra with a resolution of about 65,000. In the southern hemisphere, the FORS1 (FOcal Reducer low dispersion Spectrograph) at the 8-meter Kueyen telescope of the VLT can operate in a spectropolarimetric mode with a resolution of up to 4,000. The two smaller telescopes, especially Telescope Bernard Lyot, allocate significant observing time for magnetic studies by the French and Canadian teams, enabling long-term magnetic monitoring and surveys of certain star types. However, in recent years, only a few studies of stellar magnetic fields have been conducted using FORS1 due to high demand for observing time across all instruments on Kueyen. One key advantage of FORS1 at an 8-meter telescope is its large collecting area, which provides high signal-to-noise polarimetric spectra for relatively faint stars, down to magnitude 12-13. Additionally, using Balmer series lines for measuring stellar magnetic fields in the blue spectral region observed with grisms 600B or 1200B allows for the study of fast rotators with a rotational velocity (v sin i) of up to 300 km/s. The method for measuring stellar magnetic fields with FORS1 in polarimetric mode was previously discussed eight years ago, particularly highlighting the first measurement of the strongly magnetic chemically peculiar A-type star HD 94660. Magnetic field measurements utilize the presence of circular polarization in spectral lines, which enables the determination of the longitudinal magnetic fieldâ€” the component of the magnetic field along the line of sight, averaged over the stellar disc. Since no ESO pipeline exists for the FORS1 spectropolarimetric mode, spectrum extraction is conducted using a pipeline created by Thomas Szeifert. The software for measuring magnetic field strength has been developed by our team. The following sections outline the magnetic field discoveries achieved with FORS1 in recent years.
