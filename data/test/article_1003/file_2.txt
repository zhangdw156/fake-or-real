A relevant question regarding the E-ELT's performance is whether a smaller telescope with the same adaptive optics (AO) technology, such as an equal number of actuators, would perform better by achieving higher Strehl ratios and corrections at shorter wavelengths. We have examined the trade-offs between collecting area and AO performance based on options our industrial partners have explored. Our analysis shows that, for sensitivity at near-infrared wavelengths, the increase in telescope diameter compensates for the decrease in Strehl ratios between 30 and 42 meters. However, around 50 meters, the increased diameter in the J-band no longer compensates for the loss of Strehl when using lower actuator density technology. (In terms of spatial resolution, a larger telescope is always advantageous). The Gregorian design offers better AO performance due to its larger adaptive mirror accommodating more actuators. Smaller telescopes may have advantages at shorter wavelengths, depending on the actuator technology used. Nevertheless, the five-mirror design has a clear upgrade path to higher actuator density mirrors, making any current disadvantages temporary. Additionally, AO performance at short wavelengths depends not only on the number of actuators but also on other factors such as correction bandwidth and laser power for brighter guide stars. Therefore, it's not certain that a smaller telescope would be capable of making corrections at optical wavelengths when the E-ELT begins its observations. Thus, we conclude that a larger telescope will generally outperform smaller ones in the relevant range. Another way to assess performance is through 'speed,' meaning the time required to achieve the same signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio on the same object with telescopes of different diameters. Even with a 'constant' number of actuators, a 42-meter telescope significantly outperforms an 8-meter telescope, achieving over 350 times better performance in the K-band even with lower actuator technology. While one might suggest that a 42-meter telescope could accomplish in one night what an 8-meter telescope would take a year to complete (assuming the same instrumental setup), the reverse is not valid. The true advantage of a larger telescope lies in its ability to detect fainter objects with improved spatial resolution. Additionally, the increase in performance gained through AO is significantly better compared to gains achieved under seeing-limited conditions.
