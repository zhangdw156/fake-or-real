Research indicates that spiral and elliptical galaxy types became common around half their current age in our universe's history - an era where irregular or clumpy galaxies also appeared frequently - prompting scientists to investigate how these shapes develop through dynamics at higher redshifts where they are likely more prevalent than today's observations allow us see them clearly yet . These findings suggest that understanding how angular momentum shifts within these early galactic structures could be crucial for understanding how our universe developed into its current form; specifically it highlights how studying these changes can help test existing theories about galaxy formation . To achieve this goal researchers will utilize sophisticated techniques like spatially resolved spectroscopy with Integral Field Units on telescopes like VLT to analyze bright emission lines like H or [O II] 3727 A across hundreds over thousands of distant Galaxies stretching back nearly ten billion years from today . This ambitious project seeks data from over a thousand distant Galaxies spanning approximately one hundred million light years away from us , with observations made using two distinct instruments: KMOS and MUSE on VLT .
