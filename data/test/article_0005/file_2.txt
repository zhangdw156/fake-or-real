Greek observations indicate that spiral and elliptical galaxy formations started emerging around half their current age within our universe's history - a time where irregular or clumpy types are also common.. To better understand these early stages and how they relate directly with modern galaxy shapes through their rotation patterns we need more data from distant objects at higher redshifts.. Computer simulations suggest much Greek morphological change happens during this period so understanding it will help us refine our existing models about how these shapes develop.. We can use specialized telescopes with advanced technology like Integral Field Units which allow us study individual stars within a whole group at once - essentially mapping bright emission lines like H or [O II] across many different objects - allowing us access almost 1000 Greek objects up until z1 with enough information about their structure over approximately 1 billion years worth! This effort utilizes two instruments on VLT: KMOS and MUSE which allows for detailed observations spanning vast stretches throughout space time .
