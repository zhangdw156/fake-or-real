The EDisCS data reveals two types of groups with different galaxy characteristics but similar velocity dispersions of 100â€“400 km/s. One type, called high-[Oii] groups, has over 80% star-forming galaxies, mainly late-type morphologies, and no post-starburst galaxies, making them similar to the "field" in their galaxy traits. The other type, low-[Oii] groups, has less than 50% star-forming galaxies, mostly early-type morphologies, and a high proportion of post-starburst galaxies, resembling the galaxy populations of massive clusters. It is suggested that these differences may arise because low-[Oii] groups are true virialized groups, while high-[Oii] groups are still forming or are unbound associations. However, this explanation may not account for the bimodality observed since there is also a wide variation in star-forming fractions among X-ray selected groups, which have a hot intra-group medium. The distinct galaxy populations in these groups could provide insight into how galaxy properties relate to their environment. Future large surveys with high-quality data will help answer this question.
