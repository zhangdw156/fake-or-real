astronauts are on humanity's quest to understand our place in universe through exciting new technology like powerful telescopes that allow us to see farther than ever before! This report details how this international team called "the European Southern Optical Infrared (SOI) Program" will continue to explore our universe over time by using cutting edge technologies like robotics on Earth as well as robotic robots on other planets! Also included are plans for future missions like a giant new telescope named "the Ariane 4" that will be built in Florida starting next year!
