The antenna array located at an altitude of 5,000 meters can be modified by repositioning antennas on the stations on the Chajnantor plateau. The setup can shift from a compact arrangement, where all antennas are within an area of 160 meters by 250 meters, to an extended setup where the maximum distance between antennas can reach about 15 kilometers. To relocate antennas, each weighing around 100 tons, the ALMA project has created a special transport vehicle. Two of these vehicles will be necessary to meet operational relocation needs. These transporters will move antennas between the assembly and maintenance area at the Operations Support Facility (OSF) and the Array Operations Site (AOS), as well as between different antenna stations at the AOS for reconfiguration. The transporter allows for positioning antennas with an accuracy of a few millimeters on the high-precision station interface. The weight of the antennas, their precision requirements, and the challenging high-altitude environment place specific demands on these vehicles. Each transporter will weigh about 150 tons and measure around 10 × 15 × 6 meters (width × length × height). ESO signed a contract with Scheuerle Fahrzeugfabrik GmbH on December 22, 2005, for the production of these unique transporters. The first transporter is scheduled to be tested in summer 2007 and delivered to the OSF in the fourth quarter of 2007, with the second vehicle expected to arrive about six months later.
