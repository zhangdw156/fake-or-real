The antenna array located 5,000 m up in the air can be modified by repositioning antennas on the stations on the Chajnantor plateau. The setup can be altered from a compact arrangement, where all antennas are within 160 m × 250 m, to a wider formation, allowing antennas to be spaced up to 15 km apart. To facilitate the movement of antennas, each weighing around 100 tons, the ALMA project has created a specialized transport vehicle. Two such vehicles will be necessary to handle operational relocations. These transporters will transport antennas between the assembly and maintenance site at the OSF and the AOS, and also between different antenna positions at the AOS to rearrange the array. The transporter is capable of placing the antennas with precision down to a few millimeters at the highly accurate station interface. The massive rollers, along with the demand for precise positioning in harsh, high-altitude conditions, have led to specific design criteria for these vehicles. Each transporter is to weigh roughly 150 tons and measure about 10 × 15 × 6 m (width × length × height). The contract for manufacturing these unique vehicles was signed by ESO with Scheuerle Fahrzeugfabrik GmbH on December 22, 2005. The first transporter is expected to exit the hangar for testing in the summer of 2007, and then be delivered to the OSF by the fourth quarter of 2007, with the second one anticipated six months later.
