NGC 3960 is one of the youngest and closest clusters in our study, making it crucial for understanding the radial metallicity gradient and its change over time in the galaxy. A recent photometric survey determined that the cluster is aged between 0.9 and 1.4 billion years and has varying levels of reddening. Thus, performing spectroscopic studies is necessary to refine its characteristics. Our analysis of the UVES spectra from seven stars in the cluster shows an iron content nearly equal to solar levels, differing from earlier findings that suggested slightly lower metallicity based on lower-resolution spectra. This emphasizes the need for precise measurements using high-resolution spectroscopy. The previous lower metallicity estimate positioned NGC 3960 among the most metal-poor clusters for its age and distance from the galaxy center, contributing to discrepancies in the [Fe/H] versus age and galactocentric distance diagrams for relatively young clusters. These discrepancies are significantly reduced with our determined [Fe/H] value. Our determined [X/Fe] ratios represent the first findings for NGC 3960, showing values near solar for magnesium, silicon, titanium, and nickel, while aluminum is slightly lower and sodium, calcium, and chromium are somewhat higher. The average [a/Fe] ratio is nearly solar.
