NGC 3960 is one of the youngest and closest clusters in our study, making it crucial for understanding the radial metallicity gradient and its changes over time in the Galaxy. A recent photometric analysis determined that the cluster is aged between 0.9 and 1.4 billion years and has varying levels of reddening. To better refine its characteristics, spectroscopic studies are necessary. Our analysis of UVES spectra from seven clump stars reveals that the iron content is nearly solar, contrasting with previous lower estimates based on lower-resolution spectra. This finding highlights the importance of using high-resolution spectra for accurate abundance measurements. The earlier lower metallicity estimate had positioned NGC 3960 as one of the most metal-poor clusters for its age and distance from the Galactic center, contributing to the spread observed in the [Fe/H] versus age and RGC diagrams for younger clusters at short distances. This spread significantly decreases with our derived [Fe/H] values. Our [X/Fe] ratios are the first measurements for NGC 3960; we found near-solar values for Mg, Si, Ti, and Ni, while aluminium is slightly less abundant, and Na, Ca, and Cr are somewhat enhanced. The average [a/Fe] ratio is nearly solar.
