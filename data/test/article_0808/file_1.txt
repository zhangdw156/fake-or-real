Research on gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies is revealing new information about galaxy formation that was previously little understood. This is because GRB host galaxies are typically faint and found at high redshifts. Finding similar galaxies using standard methods is very challenging, as it would need long observation times, even with the best telescopes. GRB events provide a quicker way to discover faint and distant galaxies. They are identified as brief, intense phenomena, and their locations (and sometimes their redshifts) are determined from the bright X-ray and optical afterglow. Long-duration GRBs are known to occur in star-forming regions, linking them to galaxies. Specific programs can help complete these investigations. In our GHostS search, we aim to study various important galaxy characteristics, such as metallicity, star formation rate, stellar mass, age of the stellar population, and dust extinction. Each of these characteristics is challenging to measure due to the faintness of typical GRB hosts and the inconsistency of data collected by researchers. Additionally, the methods used to estimate these physical properties can have systematic errors that may overshadow the intended findings. Typically, GRB hosts are star-forming galaxies with low mass and low metallicity, observed at redshifts below z = 2. The average stellar mass found in our sample is comparable to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Observational limitations hinder us from thoroughly examining the same characteristics in GRBs at higher redshifts, except in rare cases. The detection of cold interstellar medium in high-redshift hosts suggests that these galaxies may differ, showing greater stellar masses, higher star formation rates, and higher metallicities. It remains unclear whether this indicates a different population or simply different observational biases. Future telescopes and instruments will address these challenges. Overall, we recognize that GRB hosts are unique galaxies. It is still uncertain if this uniqueness arises from the limitations of our traditional observational techniques or if GRB hosts are inherently different. The major constraint is the small number of identified galaxies to date, which is still fewer than 100, in contrast to the over 100,000 galaxies found in current surveys.
