**Masses and Mass-to-Light Ratios of Early-Type Galaxies at High Redshift – The Impact of Ultradeep FORS2 Spectroscopy**  
Using FORS2 on the VLT, we captured very deep spectra of a group of early-type galaxies at redshift z ~ 1. This data, combined with high-resolution images from HST, allows us to calculate their dynamical masses. We explore how the multi-wavelength photometric Fundamental Plane evolves, focusing on the near-infrared, which significantly informs our understanding of how early-type galaxies form and develop depending on their mass and surroundings. Notably, we discovered that large early-type galaxies formed early (at z > 2) regardless of their environment. Spectroscopy of remote galaxies is now a key focus for major telescopes. For z ≈ 1 or lower, getting a redshift measurement usually takes under an hour. Consequently, current instruments can measure redshifts of thousands of galaxies to assess their number densities, luminosity functions, clustering traits, and changes over cosmic time. While redshift is helpful, it is not enough to understand an individual galaxy's physical characteristics. The most crucial measurement is mass or mass-to-light ratio (M/L), which reveals how galaxy mass functions develop over cosmic time. Mass-related measurements can be clearly compared with theoretical models, unlike luminosities and colors. To determine galaxy masses, high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra are necessary; the spatial and dynamical features in the spectra can provide insights into the galaxies' gravitational potential. This requires choosing relatively bright galaxies at moderate redshifts (z ≈ 1) and long integration times. In this article, we outline an observational program at the VLT that achieved 8−24-hour deep spectroscopic observations of early-type galaxies up to z = 1.3. These extended integrations enabled us to achieve two new findings. We measured the luminosity evolution rate of early-type galaxies up to z = 1.3, which helps constrain their formation timeline. We explain how this relates to their environment and mass and how it aligns with theoretical models. Secondly, we examined the evolution of optical colors and M/L alongside the near-infrared evolution derived from Spitzer Space Telescope observations. This analysis sheds light on the use of IR light as a mass indicator and tests stellar population models.
