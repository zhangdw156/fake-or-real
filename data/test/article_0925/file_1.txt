**Masses and Mass-to-Light Ratios of Early-Type Galaxies at High Redshift – The Impact of Ultradeep FORS2 Spectroscopy**

Using the FORS2 instrument on the VLT, we obtained very deep spectra of early-type galaxies at a redshift of about z ~ 1. This data, paired with high-resolution imaging from HST, allows us to calculate dynamical masses for these galaxies. We analyze the changes in the multi-wavelength photometric Fundamental Plane, particularly in the near-infrared, which helps us understand how early-type galaxies form and evolve based on their mass and surrounding environment. We find that the most massive early-type galaxies originated early, around z > 2, regardless of their environment. Observations of distant galaxies are a major focus of large telescopes today. For galaxies with z approximately 1 or lower, redshift measurements usually take less than an hour to obtain. Current instruments make it feasible to measure redshifts for thousands of galaxies to analyze their density, luminosity, clustering, and cosmic evolution. However, redshift alone cannot be used to ascertain specific physical properties of a single galaxy. The most crucial factor is the mass or mass-to-light ratio (M/L), which reveals how galaxies build their mass over cosmic time. Mass-related measurements can be clearly compared with theoretical models, unlike luminosities and colors. To determine galaxy masses, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra are necessary; observing the spatial and dynamic details in spectral features gives us insights into a galaxy’s gravitational potential. This approach requires relatively bright galaxies at moderate redshifts (approximately z = 1) and extended exposure times. In this article, we describe an observational program at the VLT to gather 8−24-hour spectroscopic observations of early-type galaxies up to z = 1.3. These long integration periods enabled us to achieve two significant outcomes. First, we assessed how the luminosity of early-type galaxies has changed up to z = 1.3, refining our understanding of their formation timelines and how these changes vary with environment and mass, in comparison to theoretical expectations. Second, we analyzed the changes in optical colors and mass-to-light ratios in relation to near-infrared evolution based on Spitzer Space Telescope observations. This helps assess whether infrared light serves as a useful mass indicator and tests stellar population models.
