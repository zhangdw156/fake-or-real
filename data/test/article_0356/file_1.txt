High-resolution images from the AMBER data allow us to get detailed spectral information about the stellar disc and atmosphere of stars. Instead of displaying one-dimensional images, we create strips of color-coded intensity at each wavelength.  By arranging these strips side by side, we obtain a two-dimensional spectrum that shows intensity changes as a function of both wavelength and angular distance from the star. This type of data is similar to high-resolution long-slit spectroscopy but with an angular resolution of 9.8 milliarcseconds. The resulting two-dimensional spectrum reveals spikes in the carbon monoxide lines, which correspond to the extended atmosphere detected in one-dimensional images.  The extended atmosphere is asymmetric, being more extended on one side than the other. The spikes in the carbon monoxide line profiles are only observed in the blue half of the spectra, reflecting that the extended atmosphere can only be seen in this part of the spectrum. 
We obtain detailed spectral information by taking a horizontal slice through the two-dimensional spectrum. This technique revealed that while the central section of the stellar disc shows a similar spectrum to the one without spatial detail, the extended atmosphere reveals significant emission. The strength of the lines decreases near the star's limb because their emission from the extended atmosphere and absorption from the stellar disc are partially canceled out due to the limited beam size. This result aligns with Kirchhoffâ€™s laws regarding spectral line behavior. Our findings highlight that it is possible to obtain spatially resolved spectra on other stars, as well as create 2D maps of velocity fields at each position. We're currently working on these projects for the red supergiant Antares and the red giant R Dor.
