The m-parameter indicates the total years a facility has been in operation, but both h and m are overall figures that donâ€™t reveal how these values were reached over time. As a result, we expanded the h-index to track its changes over time as h(t). To calculate h(t), we retrieved the citation records for each paper in our study from the ADS, showing the number of citations each paper received each year. For example, a paper published in 2002 might get x citations in 2002, y citations in 2003, z citations in 2004, and so on. To find h for a specific year Y, we sum all citations up to that year using the citation records of each paper. We then rank the papers in order of citations received, and the h-index for year Y is calculated. In this study, we consider all observatories as single entities, which does not accurately represent their early operations, as they were launched one after another, gradually increasing observation time each year. Future research may examine h(t) based on the actual observation time of each observatory.
