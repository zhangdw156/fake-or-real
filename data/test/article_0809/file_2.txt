The m-parameter indicates the total years a facility has been in operation, but both h and m are overall figures that don’t reveal how these values got reached over time. As a result, we expanded the h-index to track its changes, denoted as h(t). To determine h(t), we obtained the citation record for each paper in our study from the ADS. This record shows how many citations each paper received during specific years. For example, a paper published in 2002 may receive x citations in that year, y in the next, and z in following years. To compute h for the year Y, we sum all citations up to that year using the citation records of each paper. The papers are then arranged in decreasing order, leading to the calculation of the h-index for that year. In our study, all observatories are considered as single units, which doesn’t accurately represent their initial periods. Each came online at different times, gradually extending the total observing hours over time. A subsequent study may examine h(t) based on each observatory's true long-term observation period.
