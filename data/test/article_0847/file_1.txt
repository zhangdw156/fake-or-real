The creation of a single software system for the ALMA Observatory is a crucial task that necessitates close collaboration among all ALMA engineering project teams. Building software requires a unified strategy and policy from the start, involving both the engineering teams and the European and North American partners. Unlike some hardware projects that use specialized instruments, this initiative needs complete software packages developed under one management structure. ALMA Software Development operates as a fully integrated organization with contributions from Europe, North America, and Japan. The leaders from these regions have defined specific work packages under a shared management. In Europe, work is coordinated by ESO, with the main software development and management center located at ESO's headquarters in Garching. Numerous software packages are created by ESO in partnership with European institutions that have skilled staff for developing and testing the necessary software.
