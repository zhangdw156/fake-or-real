Creating a unified software system for the ALMA Observatory is a significant task that demands close collaboration with all the ALMA engineering teams. Software development necessitates a coordinated approach and unified guidelines from the start, not just among the engineering teams, but also among European and North American partners. Unlike indexable hardware tasks where specialized instruments are used, this project involves the development of complete software packages managed and organized collectively. ALMA Software Development operates as an integrated trilateral organization involving Europe, North America, and Japan, where specific work packages have been outlined under central leadership. The European work is coordinated by ESO, with its main software development and management center located at ESO's headquarters in Garching. Numerous software packages are built by ESO in partnership with European institutions staffed with experienced personnel who develop and test the necessary software.
