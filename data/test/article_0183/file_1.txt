Since joining forces with other astronomy organizations like ESA's VISTA project launched after its membership expansion , efforts focused on enhancing collaboration among astronomers using European Southern Observatory telescopes (ESO).
These efforts led astronomers working together on various projects like large surveys across different wavelengths using telescopes such as VLT to obtain significant amounts of astronomical information .
The success was due partly because these collaborations resulted in efficient workflows that allowed them access vast amounts of astronomical resources while ensuring accessibility through open archives . To optimize this process , feedback loops between astronomers who use these observations along with technical staff at ESA helped improve how they gather information about astronomical observation results .
This collaborative process led ESA staff create specialized committees dedicated specifically focusing on issues related to scientific research endeavors within their organization such as managing scientific datasets or allocating time slots reserved specifically during observation sessions . Through regular communication between scientists who use these resources alongside those responsible for managing them , they identified areas where improvements could be made . This included streamlining proposal submission processes by reducing frequency while introducing an expedited path available only if needed quickly , introducing new programs that would allow researchers access additional resources without submitting new requests each time or creating channels specifically designed toward joint research projects involving both ESA facilities like ALMA and others outside Europe
Furthermore , ESA is actively developing tools that support researchers by providing them access easy ways analyze their findings through various methods including pre-processing steps before publishing results online which makes it easier than ever before! The initial reports generated during this initial phase along with subsequent feedback provided by user communities regarding proposed changes have all been made widely accessible online so anyone can check out what is happening inside those two organizations!
