The Pluto-Charon system and Triton were used as reference sources for adaptive optics adjustments during visible light observations. For Pluto-Charon, the NACO slit (172 mas wide) was aligned with the orbit's angle to capture both objects simultaneously. For Triton, the slit was oriented at the parallactic angle. The targets were observed in the K-band, and corrections were made based on zenith distance to ensure optimal slit positioning for objects in the L- and M-bands, although this slightly affected the JHK signal due to losses from atmospheric refraction. Observations followed the standard A-B-B-A nodding pattern, with some additional jitter. To remove the spectral features from Pluto/Charon and Triton caused by earth's atmosphere and sunlight, observations of the nearby solar-type star HD 162341 were taken approximately every 1.5 hours. As a result, each observation of Pluto-Charon and Triton was paired with corresponding calibration star observations made under similar sky conditions and with the same instrument and adaptive optics settings.
