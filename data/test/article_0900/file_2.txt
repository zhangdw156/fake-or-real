The Pluto-Charon system and Triton were used as reference sources for adaptive optics adjustments. For Pluto-Charon, the NACO slit (172 mas wide) was aligned with the binary's orbital angle to observe both at the same time. For Triton, the slit was positioned at the parallactic angle. Observations were made in the K-band, and an appropriate offset correction was applied based on zenith distance to optimize the slit positions for L- and M-band, slightly affecting the JHK signal due to slit losses from atmospheric refraction. The standard A-B-B-A nodding technique, with some jitter, was used during the observations. To eliminate the telluric and solar features from the spectra of Pluto/Charon and Triton, observations of the nearby solar analog star HD 162341 were taken approximately every 1.5 hours. This ensured that each observation of Pluto-Charon and Triton had corresponding 'before' and 'after' calibration star observations under similar sky conditions and with the same instrument and AO settings.
