Recent studies using ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) have shown that extremely distant (z7) quasars are likely formed within some of Earth's most massive galaxies during their early development stages in space time . These observations reveal these powerful "black hole" powered quasars reside within bright infrared emitting galaxies with active star formations estimated to range from around 100 - 1600 solar masses per year . By studying these distant objects, scientists can better understand how giant structures form throughout cosmic history . Further analysis using high resolution images has revealed key details about gas distribution within these host galaxy structures suggesting intense star formation activity is driving this gas heating process .
