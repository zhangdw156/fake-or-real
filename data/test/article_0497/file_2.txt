The Submillimeter Array (SMA) was used to observe sub-mm emission from a galaxy at 870 µm wavelength with a resolution of 0.2 arcseconds. This map resolved the galaxy into eight discrete components, representing two mirror images of the galaxy each containing four distinct emission regions. Reconstructed using a lensing model, the galaxy's source plane reveals four bright star-forming regions (A, B, C, and D) separated by 1.5 kpc in projection. The highest resolution within these regions is around 90 pc, comparable to the size of giant molecular clouds in our Milky Way galaxy.

The sizes and luminosities of the star-forming regions observed in SMMJ2135-0102 were compared to dense molecular clouds (GMCs) in the local universe.  Generally, GMCs show a correlation between size and 260-µm luminosity, where luminosity increases proportionally with the cubed radius. However, within densely packed cores of GMCs and young Hii regions, massive stars dominate emission, leading to luminosities that are ~100 times higher than typical GMCs.  The star-forming regions in SMMJ2135-0102 are about 100 pc across but exhibit luminosities 100 times higher than expected for typical star-forming regions. Furthermore, the luminosity densities of these regions compare favorably with dense GMC cores, although their luminosities are 10^7 times greater.  Consequently, it is likely that each of the star-forming regions in SMMJ2135-0102 comprises ~10^7 densely packed GMC cores. 

Finally, the luminosity and star formation rate densities observed in these regions are similar to those found in the highest density regions of the nearby starburst galaxy Arp220, scaled up by a factor of 10 in both size and luminosity.  This study indicates that recipes developed to understand star-forming processes in the Milky Way and similar local galaxies can be applied effectively to model the process in these high-redshift galaxies.
