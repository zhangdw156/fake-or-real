A new version of the pipeline software for processing astronomical data has been released, incorporating two new recipes: one for calibration frames and another for reducing scientific exposures. These new recipes are mandatory for processing data after the VIMOS CCD upgrade and can also be used for older data. This new software from ESO aims to replace the previous five MOS recipes. The new calibration recipe uses a pattern recognition method, similar to the FORS1/2 and EFOSC2 pipelines, which reduces the workload of software maintenance since it no longer requires preliminary optical and spectral modeling of the instrument. This approach addresses mechanical instability issues common in real-world instruments, particularly those impacting VIMOS. The new recipes significantly improve accuracy in wavelength calibration, sky subtraction, object extraction, and sky fringing correction.  The new pipeline and user manual can be downloaded.
