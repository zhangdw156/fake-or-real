Our study involves ten Galactic globular clusters observed in 2010 and 2011, including Omega Centauri as a key target.  We have analyzed these clusters and created velocity maps for them. However, analyzing all the clusters together presents challenges because they exhibit unique characteristics: some display shallow kinematic profiles while others appear to have multiple centers - one based on light (photometry) and one based on movement (kinematics). Nevertheless, we are confident that we can determine if a particular cluster contains an intermediate-mass black hole using its central motion. We expect to be able to estimate the clusters' masses accurately.  For example, the model for NGC 6388 requires a black hole of 17,000 solar masses to fit the data, while the velocity dispersion profile in the core of NGC 2808 is quite flat and indicates an intermediate-mass black hole larger than 1,000 solar masses cannot be supported. In this way, we find clusters with central points rising just like NGC 6388 and Omega Centauri. After completing our analyses and models for all the clusters, we will start studying how their presence and mass are correlated with other cluster characteristics. We will also develop criteria to continue our search for intermediate-mass black holes and use our expertise to explore more distant objects and larger samples. This approach helps us advance our understanding of globular cluster formation and evolution, and bring us closer to the knowledge needed to understand the growth of black holes and galaxy formation itself.
