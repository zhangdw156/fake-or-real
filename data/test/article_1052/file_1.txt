**Title:** New, Efficient High-Resolution Red VPH Grisms in VIMOS

VIMOS is a visible wide-field imager and multi-object spectrograph located at Mount Melipal (UT3). It consists of four identical arms, each covering a 7 by 8 field of view with a 0.05 pixel size and a 2 gap between quadrants. Each arm has six grisms that provide spectral resolution from about 200 to 2500 and includes an EEV 44-82, thinned, anti-reflection coated, 4k by 2k pixel CCD. VIMOS functions in three modes: Imaging (IMG), Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS), and Integral Field Unit (IFU). For an overview of the instrument's capabilities and performance. During testing, one of the High-Resolution Red grisms (600 grooves per millimeter) was damaged. Since VIMOS began operations in 2003, observations in this mode relied on a High-Resolution grism in the orange channels, which, combined with the low efficiency of the old grisms, limited the instrument's performance. In September 2005, the damaged High-Resolution red grisms were replaced with new Volume Phase Holographic (VPH) grisms that offered improved efficiency and maintained the same spectral resolution. These VPH grisms were produced by CSL, and the Optical Instrumentation Department handled their specifications, procurement, and assembly with adhesives. The Integration Department carried out the mounting design, integration, and testing. Commissioning and assessment were performed by staff at Paranal and those assigned to VIMOS in the Data Management Division. One of the final optical assemblies for the prisms and grisms is described, as well as its new mechanical mount, which features an onboard alignment system that minimizes realignment time after dismounting or earthquakes to just a few minutes. The efficiency curves of the old and new grisms, tested in the ESO optical lab, are compared; the wavelength range of 0.6 to 0.9 microns corresponds to a slit at the center of the field. The performance of the new VPH grisms with VIMOS was measured by observing spectrophotometric standard stars on different photometric nights. The overall efficiencies for UT3, VIMOS, and grisms using both the old and new VPH High-Resolution red grisms, as provided by the ESO VIMOS pipeline, are discussed. A significant improvement (about 40 to 70 percent, depending on wavelength) has been achieved across the entire spectral range covered by the grisms.
