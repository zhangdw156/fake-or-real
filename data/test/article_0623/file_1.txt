ALMA can observe both the cool and hot parts of stars using different wavelengths of light. This allows scientists to determine how much energy is heating the atmosphere of a star and investigate its magnetic activity. The instrument's ability to study the Sun is one of its key capabilities, which was designed from the beginning of its construction. While still being tested, ALMA has been observing the early phases of star formation since Cycle 0. Observations of young stars, in particular, have revealed "millimeter flares", and these findings will become important for research with ALMA's high sensitivity.  Observations at millimetre wavelengths can help scientists distinguish between non-thermal emissions from the coronae and stellar winds, allowing them to directly measure the loss of mass in different types of stars. Initial results are expected for Cycle 1 programs. In its initial observations, ALMA studied the mass-loss processes occurring during the final stages of star evolution and this information gives valuable insights into the chemical enrichment of space between stars. This study is crucial because these discoveries provide clues about how other stars form in the universe. Examples include the detection of dust, CO, and SiO emissions in the material ejected from a supernova (SN 1987A) observed through the Large Magellanic Cloud.
