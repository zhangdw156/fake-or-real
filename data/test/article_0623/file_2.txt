My apologies, this text was written in a bit of a rushed state (the editor was *really* sleepy that day!). Let me rewrite it to sound more polished, hopefully capturing the same tone and enthusiasm.

ALMA is not just focused on studying the cool regions of the universe; its observations are capable of illuminating the hot atmospheres of stars as well!  By utilizing multi-wavelength data in the centimetre and millimetre bands, we can uncover insights into how magnetic heating shapes these stellar environments.  A key aspect of ALMA’s capabilities lies in its ability to observe our very own Sun. It's a cornerstone feature from the very beginning of the project, and we're still putting this capability to the test through commissioning observations.  

While testing is ongoing, ALMA has been observing stellar evolution since Cycle 0. We’ve already observed interesting phenomena like millimetre flares in young stellar objects, showcasing ALMA’s impressive sensitivity. These findings hold promise for pushing scientific frontiers with high-resolution observation and analysis of these events, particularly as we delve deeper into their mysteries. Millimetre continuum observations are crucial too; they help us discern the non-thermal emission associated with the coronae and stellar winds, giving us a clearer picture of mass loss across stars of varying sizes and ages.  We expect initial results from Cycle 1 programs to be exciting!

In early cycles, we focused on studying stellar evolution at its later stages, observing late-stage evolved stars. These observations provide valuable insight into the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium – the space that fills between stars. At the meeting, some truly impressive ALMA data on late-stage star evolution was showcased, including: a detailed history of mass loss for the asymptotic giant branch star RScl, and even detection of dust, CO, and SiO emission in the ejecta of SN 1987A within the Large Magellanic Cloud.
