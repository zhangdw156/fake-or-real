Quasar absorbers are classified into different groups based on their column density, which measures the number of hydrogen atoms per unit area viewed from the observer to the quasar (typically in atoms cm–2). A cloud with a low column density could be either small and dense or large and less dense. They are thought to examine various physical environment conditions including the halos and discs of various galaxies, both dwarf and normal (proto)type. Damped Lyman-alpha systems have a certain column density and significantly contribute to the neutral gas WHI. However, a new study of quasars with a redshift greater than 4 suggests that a portion of the H I may exist in systems that fall below the classic DLA threshold. This study proposed adopting a new definition for these integrated column densities of more than 10^19 atoms cm–2 and names them “sub-Damped Lyman-alpha systems” (sub-DLAs). Such high column density systems are said to effectively trace the locations of galaxies: for a view through the Milky Way, many line optics register densities aligning with ≈>10^19 atoms cm–2, indicating that we exist within a sub-DLA. The research of sub-DLAs has become increasingly feasible thanks to advancements in technologies for 8-10 meter telescopes, and high-resolution spectroscopy has been necessary for evaluating them. Interactions with the Ultraviolet-Visual Echelle Spectrograph UVES mounted on the second unit telescope (UT2) have significantly contributed to recent advancements related to our inquiries into quasar absorbers, particularly sub-DLAs. In 2001, we started a program focused on compiling and analyzing a consistent set of sub-DLAs conduction leading towards enhancing the understanding intended to unpack insights regarding the empowerment portions of early-phase galaxy formation by scrutinizing absorption indices recorded therein.
