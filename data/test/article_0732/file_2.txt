Quasar absorbers are classified into different groups based on their column density, which measures the number of hydrogen atoms per unit area along the line of sight to the quasar (usually given in atoms cm–2). As a result, a low column density cloud can either be a small, dense cloud or a large, less dense one. These clouds are thought to explore various physical conditions, including halos and discs of both dwarf and regular (proto)galaxies. Damped Lyman-alpha systems have high column densities and are significant contributors to neutral gas in the universe. However, recent data from quasars at redshifts greater than 4 suggests that some hydrogen may be found in systems that fall below the usual Damped Lyman-alpha classification. We propose to expand this definition to include systems with column densities greater than 10^19 atoms cm–2, introducing the term "sub-Damped Lyman-alpha systems" (sub-DLAs). Such high column density systems are effective indicators of galaxies: many lines of sight through the Milky Way have these densities, indicating that we reside in a sub-DLA. The study of sub-DLAs has been facilitated by advancements in telescope technologies in the 8–10-meter range. High-resolution spectroscopy is essential for examining sub-DLAs. The Ultraviolet-Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) on the UT2 telescope has been crucial in enhancing our understanding of quasar absorbers, especially sub-DLAs. In 2001, we started a program to create and analyze a consistent sample of sub-DLAs, with the overarching aim of uncovering insights about the early phases of galaxy evolution from the absorption systems we detect.
