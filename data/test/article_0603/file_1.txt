Commissioning is the final step in building a telescope. This involved transforming basic components into a functional instrument.  We have successfully completed this final stage of development. The commissioning process for both the telescope and its camera should occur simultaneously as OmegaCAM needs a functioning VST to be properly tuned, and vice-versa. While teamwork between OmegaCAM, ESO, and VST teams is important, good working relationships mitigate any potential challenges.  The INAF team, comprising ten people from Capodimonte, Padua, and Arcetri, worked collaboratively with all other involved groups at Paranal. The relatively small mirror diameter of the telescope did not significantly simplify the process, although it may have made certain aspects more challenging due to limited space and restricted access. Despite this, the commissioning plan for the VST was designed for a fast completion timeframe within a few months. This included camera commissioning.  Though ambitious, it wasn't considered impossible due to previous work done prior, ESO's support in every step of the way and a skilled team of expert consultants from both ESO and Garching. The commissioning plan followed diligently and concluded on time. However, upon concluding the scheduled activities, a need for additional shimming, as discussed later, arose. This adjustment took place in July 2011 to improve the overall image quality across the entire field of view.
