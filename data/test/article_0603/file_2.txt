"You know how some folks love their cats? Well, for this cat-loving team at INAF, those furry friends were just background noise while they wrestled with commissioning the new telescope!  We're talking about transforming that big ol' chunk of iron and glass into a real work of art - a telescope like none other. 

Turns out, getting it to cooperate took longer than anyone thought. The camera, oh that camera! It wanted a working VST to tune up its act, just like the cats need their playtime. Communication was key (even if some team members had better communication skills than others!), and thankfully, everyone got along. There were a few hiccups here and there, especially with the compact mirror diameter.  Imagine trying to play hide-and-seek in a small box! It definitely made things a little more challenging, you know? But the INAF team's grit paid off - thanks to ESO for those stellar engineers who helped us every step of the way, like the cats that got spoiled with treats.

Planning was tight and ambitious, like our cat-loving crew's late-night cuddle sessions. The groundwork was solid (those were no-cat sleepless nights!), and ESO folks were always there to lend a paw, which is just like how those furry friends purr! But the real magic happened when we actually got to work on it. It all went smoothly, clocking in on time - except for the little issue with that image quality that needed some tweaks (like cat hair clinging to your favorite sweater!). We figured out a way to refine it in July 2011, just like how cats deserve their own playtime."
