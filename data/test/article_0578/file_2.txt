Scientists have gathered a massive amount of data about the b Pic planetary system over 28 years. This data offers unique insights into the planet formation process as it occurs and has advanced our understanding significantly. However, many questions remain unanswered. For example, what is the origin of the stable gas within this system? How can we learn more about planet formation through studying dust and gas properties?  ALMA's impressive test image holds significant promise for answering some key questions. We also seek to understand how b Pic b formed and whether other planets may exist in this system based on observed dust rings or clumps. Future research using powerful instruments like VLT/SPHERE and Gemini/Gemini Planet Imager will significantly improve our understanding. Combining those findings with data from radial velocity or astrometric measurements will provide even more accurate insights.
