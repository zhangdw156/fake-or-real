The goal is to measure element abundances in stars with high accuracy (within about 0.1-0.2 dex). This applies to both bright objects where we can measure up to twenty elements precisely and fainter ones where we aim for an overall understanding using key element abundances within about 0..2 - .3 dex precision depending on individual star characteristics like metallicity or age etc.. This method allows us to identify specific types like carbon rich or neutron capture enriched stars among others . Details on these methods including examples are provided along with a calculation demonstrating how many successful observations contribute towards increasing our "figure-of-merit" which currently increases linearly based on target count but could potentially be adjusted using a new approach which includes partially successful measurements as well due to certain limitations discussed elsewhere .
