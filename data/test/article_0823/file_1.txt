Microlensing, unlike other methods, does not provide much opportunity to study planetary systems in detail because the event happens only once per star. To draw solid conclusions about how unique our Solar System is, we need a large statistical sample. More information about an individual event can be gathered once we can directly observe the lens star. This requires waiting several years for the source and lens stars to move apart in the sky. Images have already captured the lens star from the microlensing event, which has significantly reduced the uncertainty regarding the planetary features. This could also be accomplished using the Hubble Space Telescope or adaptive optics for OGLE-2005-BLG-169. However, observing the lens OGLE-2005-BLG-390La is much more challenging, as we would need to detect an object with a magnitude of about 22 that is located roughly 40 milli-arcseconds away from a star that is 10 magnitudes brighter. In the upcoming years, we will gather statistics on frozen Super-Earth planets orbiting M and K dwarf stars, which will enhance the data collected by space transit missions like COROT and KEPLER or intensive ground-based Doppler searches.
