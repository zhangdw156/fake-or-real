Microlensing, unlike other methods, does not provide much opportunity to study planetary systems in detail because this effect happens only once per star. To draw firm conclusions about how unique our Solar System is, we need a large statistical sample. More information about an individual microlensing event can be gained if the lens star is detected directly, though this requires waiting many years for the relative motion of the source and lens stars to separate them in the sky. Having images that show the lens star means the uncertainties about the planetary parameters have significantly decreased. This could be enhanced with the Hubble Space Telescope or adaptive optics, particularly for the event OGLE-2005-BLG-169. The observation of lens OGLE-2005-BLG-390La complicates this further, as it requires detecting an object around K ~ 22 magnitude approximately 40 milliarcseconds from a star that is 10 magnitudes brighter. In the next few years, information will be gathered about the frozen Super-Earth planets long orbiting M and K dwarfs, adding to the knowledge gathered by transit missions like COROT and KEPLER or robust ground-based Doppler searches.
