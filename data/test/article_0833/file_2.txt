The ALMA Back-End  
The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) is built to create high-quality images of spectral lines and continuum, allowing it to detect distant galaxies similar to the Milky Way and image forming stellar discs in nearby molecular clouds. To achieve these objectives, the signals from ALMA's antennas need to be processed and sent to the technical building in a format suitable for the correlator. The ALMA Back-End does this in a way that is reliable, flexible, and without data loss. This document provides an overview of the ALMA Back-End subsystems developed by various European Institutes under the coordination of the European Southern Observatory (ESO). Each antenna captures signals with frequencies up to 950 GHz, which are then converted by the Front-End cryogenic receivers into two Intermediate Frequency (IF) signals, one for each polarization, within the range of 4â€“12 GHz. These signals are digitized and sent to the technical building as a 120 Gbit/second raw data stream through a single optical fiber. Figure 1 illustrates the fiber network at Chajnantor. Inside the technical building (shown on the right side of Figure 2), a custom processor known as the correlator cross-correlates the signals from all antennas and pre-processes the data before relaying it to the computing system for further analysis. The IF signal processing, digitization at the antennas, and the data transmission system leading to the correlator are all components of the ALMA Back-End subsystem (depicted on the left side of Figure 2). The challenging environment requires special consideration; at an altitude of 5000 m, heat dissipation is significantly limited, and the remote location along with low oxygen levels complicates on-site maintenance. This necessitates equipment that consumes low power, is highly reliable, and is easy to maintain. While advanced information and communication technologies are approaching ALMA's needs, fulfilling those requirements necessitated pushing technology beyond current standards, leading to the development of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) where commercial options do not yet exist. The Back-End also features a photonics Local Oscillator that delivers an extremely phase-accurate signal to all antennas.
