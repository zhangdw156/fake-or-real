The ALMA Back-End  
The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) is built to create high-quality images of spectral lines and continuum, find distant galaxies like the Milky Way, and image proto-stellar discs in nearby molecular clouds. To achieve these objectives, the signals from the ALMA antennas must be processed and sent to the technical building in a format suitable for the correlator. The ALMA Back-End ensures this is done in a reliable, lossless, and flexible manner. This overview describes the ALMA Back-End subsystems created by various European Institutes under ESO's guidance. Each antenna captures signals at frequencies up to 950 GHz, converting them into two Intermediate Frequency (IF) signals—one for each polarization—ranging from 4–12 GHz using cryogenic receivers. These signals are then digitized and sent to the technical building as a 120 Gbit/second raw data stream through a single optical fiber. Illustrations of the fiber network at Chajnantor are shown in Figure 1. In the technical building (on the right side of Figure 2), a special processor called the correlator combines the signals from superconducting antennas and preprocesses the data before it is forwarded to the computing system for additional processing.  The IF signal processing and digitization at the antennas, along with the data transmission system to the correlator, are elements of the ALMA Back-End subsystem (shown on the left side of Figure 2). The difficult environmental conditions at 5000 m altitude necessitate urgent consideration, as heat dissipation is significantly limited, in addition to challenges posed by remote location and low oxygen levels which affect the ability to conduct maintenance. This underscores the need for devices that feature low power consumption, high reliability, and straightforward maintenance. While cutting-edge information and communication technologies are increasingly aligning with ALMA’s needs, addressing these requirements involved advancements in technology beyond current industry standards, leading to the development of specific Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) to tackle cases where the commercial solutions are inadequate. The Back-End additionally comprises a photonics local oscillator that supplies remarkably phase-accurate signals to all antennas.
