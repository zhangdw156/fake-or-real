Several features have been tested on the complete ASM, including component fatigue, eigen-frequencies, positioning speed, hysteresis, index drift, positioning resolution and accuracy, as well as the surface quality of the segments. The fully integrated ASM has met and, in some instances, exceeded the necessary specifications. The segment orientations have been chosen to display the letters of the acronym ASM in the interferogram. During the APE experiment, the ASM will operate in a closed-loop controlled by signals from an Internal Metrology system that uses a two-wavelength interferometer developed by Fogale. The seven-segment prototype tested the closed-loop system, achieving alignment errors better than 5 nm rms at the segment borders. The fully integrated ASM has successfully met and even exceeded many specifications. This achievement makes it possible to fully test future phasing sensors of the E-ELT in the Active Phasing Experiment.
