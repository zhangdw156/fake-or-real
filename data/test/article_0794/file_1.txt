Several features have been tested on the fully integrated ASM, including component fatigue, eigen-frequencies, positioning speed and hysteresis, drift of an actuated position, and the resolution and accuracy of the positioning, as well as the quality and appearance of the segment surfaces. The fully integrated ASM has met and, in some cases, exceeded the specifications. The tips and tilts of the segments have been designed so that the letters of the acronym ASM can be seen in the interferogram. During the APE experiment, the ASM will operate in a closed loop using signals from an Internal Metrology system, which includes a two-wavelength interferometer developed by Fogale. The seven-segment prototype has been used to test the closed-loop system and has achieved a performance better than 5 nm rms for alignment errors at the intersegment borders. The fully integrated ASM has now met and, in some areas, exceeded the specifications. This success enables full testing of future phasing sensors for the E-ELT in the Active Phasing Experiment.
