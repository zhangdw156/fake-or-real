While conventional multi-object spectroscopy techniques are limited by the substantial amount of time required and the diffuse background emission, which necessitates slits to identify object emissions. This approach eliminates some spectrographs that lack integral field units and reduces multiplex capability. In contrast, a slitless spectrograph allows for spectra of all bright objects and the background area without these limitations. However, in crowded areas, overlapping spectra require narrowband filters to reduce spectrum length, potentially necessitating low spectral resolution.  A large field of view with prominent objects provides exceptional multiplex with a slitless spectrograph, as demonstrated by the Wide Field Imager on the MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. This instrument could utilize about 75% of the direct imaging field's size (34 × 33 arcmin²) to achieve decent coverage across the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds. For instance, in the SMC, mean Hα width for Be stars is roughly 5 nm.  Therefore, a resolution of 5.1 nm at Hα (R=128) using the R50 grism matched this precision well. A filter centred on the Hα bandpass was used to limit the spectrum's length and avoid over crowding. Observations occurred on September 25th and 26th, 2002. Weather hampered the second night, limiting its usefulness. The typical exposure time was 600 seconds allowing detection of main sequence stars up to type F with a seeing of about 1.1 arcseconds.  Due to poor weather, no direct imaging was taken as anticipated but this presented difficulties in obtaining accurate astrometry and photometry on the same date to classify stars due to the variability associated with Be stars.
