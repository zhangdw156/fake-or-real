Quasars exhibit lines emitted by atoms whose width suggests strong gravity near their center - likely caused by supermassive Black Holes pulling them together due gravity . Scientists have been studying these lines for decades but haven't completely understood their origin yet; they could come from dense clumps within clouds or spread out areas within material flowing towards these objects or escaping outwards like jets . By combining measurements like width variations based on how much matter flows into them , scientists estimate sizes based on those observations . These studies show that larger quasars emit more light than smaller ones which makes it possible for researchers using just one spectrum image to calculate how massive they actually are . This estimation method relies on understanding how fast atoms rotate within this area where light gets emitted . Comparing this rotation pattern against observations made using powerful telescopes has led researchers towards understanding that most quasars have discs around their centers which helps explain what they see when analyzing these images through powerful telescopes like GRAVITY . For better resolution , astronomers use interferometers such as those found at VLTI Keck which help capture finer details about star systems including those related to supermassive Black Holes because they require extremely sensitive instruments capable seeing very faint signals coming from distant stars
