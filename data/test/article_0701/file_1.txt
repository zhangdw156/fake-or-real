Solar twins are pairs of stars that share similar physical characteristics like their temperature, gravity, and chemical makeup to our sun. By analyzing the spectrum of light from each star using a method called differential analysis, we can remove many systematic effects that cause inaccuracies in abundance measurements.  We have successfully tested the precision of this method with elements in the Sun by comparing their abundances to those in two asteroids, achieving extremely small differences (less than 0.1%). Additionally, our study of solar abundances at different latitudes within the sun revealed consistent results for all elements and refractory elements. This improved accuracy allowed us to discover that the chemical composition of the sun is unusual compared to typical stars. The Sun appears to be deficient in elements that are typically abundant in Earth and other rocky material found throughout the Solar System.  Crucially, there is a strong correlation between the abundance anomalies and dust condensation temperature from the initial formation stage of our solar system. This supports a link between these chemical compositions and the formation of terrestrial planets in the solar system, which was validated further by Chambers' research on adding back Earth-like materials to the Sun's composition to reduce the depletion of refractory elements. Further studies using the Sun's twin stars helped identify signatures left over from planet formation, particularly giant planets.  We also found that both stars in a binary pair of stellar twins have different chemical compositions, with one star hosting a giant planet being more deficient in volatile and refractory elements. This could be because the gas and heavy elements from the planet formation process were taken by the giant planet to form it. We also observed consistent differences in abundance between each twin, indicating clues about planet formation.
