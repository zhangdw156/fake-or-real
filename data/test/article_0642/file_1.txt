Our study began by targeting NGC 300, a spiral galaxy relatively close to us (2 million parsecs). This galaxy exhibits distinct variations in abundance across its surface, as measured using both H II regions and BSGs. We employed the new VLT NIR multi-object spectrograph KMOS for this work.  To ensure high-quality data, we focused on minimizing any contamination from sky emission and telluric features in our observations. This was achieved through a process called KMOGENIZATION. By smoothing the spectra across all spaxels, it reduces noise introduced by variations in resolution and wavelength calibration. We also extracted spectra within a 1-spaxel radius of the flux peak to minimize potential artifacts caused by sky or telluric feature removal. Co-adding repeated observations of the same target (with varying wavelengths throughout the night) onto a master wavelength scale without resampling further reduced systematic noise. After data analysis, a metallicity gradient from RSG measurements was constructed, with remarkable agreement with previous findings using BSGs and direct H II region measurement techniques.
