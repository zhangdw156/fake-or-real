Science verification testing was conducted for the VISIR instrument upgrade. The Very Large Telescope's spectrometer and imager was upgraded in 2015 with new detectors and added modes of operation. During this testing, the instrument was used to demonstrate its observational capabilities using methods such as sparse aperture masking, coronagraphy (used to block out light from stars), and recommissioned burst mode. Science verification data is publicly available.  The VISIR upgrade project included replacing a low-resolution grating with a prism, new detectors, and adding higher spatial resolution capability through the use of coronagraphic and sparse aperture masking modes. Additionally, support was added for monitoring precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere to help select optimal observing conditions. Finally, the recommissioned burst mode enabled very high time resolution sampling.
