To study the galaxy population, we examined the area of RXCJ 0014.3-3023 using three VIMOS fields that overlap at the center of the cluster and are arranged in an east-west direction. For each field, we created one multi-object spectroscopy mask for several bright galaxies and another mask for many faint galaxies. The total exposure time was approximately one hour per field, accounting for all delays. Using the VIMOS Low-Resolution Blue grism and a cautious 3 arcsecond-wide sky strip for each slit, we collected a total of 871 spectra, including 134 confirmed cluster members. The targets were chosen from an I-band image without color selection to gain an unbiased perspective on the galaxy population related to star-formation activity. The masks cover the entire cluster, extending slightly beyond the virial radius, where the density of cluster galaxies becomes low. Consequently, covering this important outer region decreases overall efficiency. We observe the cumulative ratio of emission-line galaxies compared to galaxies with spectra typical of passive stellar populations based on their environment. A clear increase in star-formation activity is evident at larger cluster radii, consistent with previous observations and findings from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in nearby clusters. There is a distinct indication that star formation is suppressed within the cluster, with this suppression beginning well outside the virial radius. This suggests that interaction with the hot intracluster medium alone does not fully account for the reduced star formation in cluster galaxies, as quenching effects appear to already be in place in the infall region. The projected distributions of star-forming and non-star-forming galaxies within the cluster do not show any clear relationship between the distribution of emission-line galaxies and the cluster's merger structure. Moreover, we observe that most emission-line galaxies are located at greater distances, with the exception of a notable compact group of three emission-line objects near the cluster center, which may actually be slightly off-center along the line of sight.
