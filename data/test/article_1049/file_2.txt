To study the galaxy population, we examined the region of RXCJ 0014.3-3023 using three VIMOS fields that overlap at the center of the cluster and are arranged in an east-west direction. For each field, we created one multi-object spectroscopy mask for several bright galaxies and another mask for many faint galaxies. The total exposure time was approximately one hour per field, accounting for all delays. Using the VIMOS Low-Resolution Blue grism and a modest 3 arcsecond-wide sky strip for each slit, we gathered a total of 871 spectra, including 134 confirmed cluster members. The selection of targets was based on an I-band image without color criteria to ensure an unbiased view of the galaxy population in terms of star-formation activity. The masks extended beyond the cluster's virial radius into the region where a few galaxies are present. While this extra coverage in the important outer area reduces overall efficiency, it is significant for our observations. Over environmental context, we examined the progression of emission-line galaxies in contrast to galaxies exhibiting characteristics typical of passive stellar populations. An increase in star-formation activity was seen at greater cluster radii, consistent with previous observations and findings from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in nearby clusters. There is a clear pattern indicating that star formation is halted within the cluster, starting noticeably outside the virial radius, suggesting that factors beyond the hot intracluster medium influence star formation suppression in cluster galaxies. The quenching process likely begins in the infall region. The observable distributions of star-forming and non-star-forming galaxies in the cluster showed no distinct relation to the clusterâ€™s merger dynamics. Moreover, the majority of emission-line galaxies are located at greater distances from the center, except for a notable compact group of three emission-line galaxies near the cluster center, which may actually be situated off-center relative to our line of sight.
