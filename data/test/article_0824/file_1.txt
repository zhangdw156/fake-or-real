The first part of the baseline correlator system set up in the AOS technical building can support up to 16 antennas and is available for interferometric commissioning requirements for early science that utilize 16 antennas and a basic range of spectral line modes. The initial call for ALMA proposals is anticipated around 2011. Several Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) and Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) modes, including various polarisation features with different total bandwidths, are expected to be implemented during the early science phase. The second correlator quadrant is scheduled for installation in 2009, while the third and fourth quadrants, which will allow support for up to 64 antennas, may be assembled by late 2010. Additional correlator configuration modes will be introduced in the future. An essential feature of ALMA is sub-arraying, which allows independent groups of antennas to operate in different modes. Implementing two sub-arrays initially is a top priority; for example, while one group of antennas maps a source, another can perform single-dish observations, or one sub-array could track a source while the other undertakes Commissioning. Each correlator quadrant may support multiple sub-arrays. The summed signals from two or more antennas will also be accessible in the correlator, facilitating the formation of a larger single antenna which, when combined with antennas situated on different continents, can achieve very high spatial resolution through a technique called Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). This will require additional equipment at the AOS and will be exploited in the future. It will also be possible to support pulsar observations, contingent on the capability to implement pulsar period models and the alignment of ALMA's receiver bands with pulsar astrophysics. Moreover, due to the configuration of the ACA patch panel and the installation of the 16-antenna correlator next to the 64-antenna baseline correlator, the following benefits can be realized: (a) enhanced ALMA sensitivity by combining data from a total of 64 antennas; (b) efficient calibration of the 12 smaller 7-meter antennas through cross-correlation with the 12-meter antennas; and (c) easier comparison and cross-calibration of the performance of the ACA and baseline correlators. These advancements are poised to enhance ALMA's scientific research opportunities.
