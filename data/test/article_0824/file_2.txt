The first part of the baseline correlator system set up in the AOS technical building can support up to 16 antennas and is ready for interferometric commissioning tasks. It satisfies the requirements for early science that need 16 antennas and a basic set of spectral line modes. The first call for ALMA proposals is anticipated around 2011. Various operational modes, including double or full polarization modes with different total bandwidths, are expected to be available for early science. The second quadrant of the correlator will be installed in 2009, while the third and fourth quadrants, which will allow support for up to 64 antennas, may be assembled by the end of 2010. Additional correlator configurations will be offered in the future. Sub-arraying, which allows processing of independent groups of antennas working in different modes, is a crucial feature of ALMA. Implementing two sub-arrays is a top priority; for example, one group of antennas could observe a source while a single antenna conducts single-dish observations, or one sub-array could track a source while another performs commissioning tasks. Each correlator quadrant can handle more than two sub-arrays. The combined output from multiple antennas in the array can also be used to create a large single antenna, which can be connected with antennas on other continents for extremely high spatial resolution. This observing method, called Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), will require additional equipment at the AOS but will definitely be utilized in the future. Pulsar observations may also be possible if pulsar period models are implemented and if the ALMA receiver bands are relevant to pulsar astrophysics. Furthermore, with the ACA patch panel and the 16-antenna correlator installed next to the 64-antenna baseline correlator, several advantages can be achieved: (a) the overall sensitivity of ALMA can be improved by merging data from up to 64 antennas; (b) calibration of the 12 smaller 7-meter antennas can be done efficiently when cross-correlated with the 12-meter antennas; (c) comparing and cross-calibrating the performance of the ACA and baseline correlators will be easier. These advancements will enhance ALMA science in the future.
