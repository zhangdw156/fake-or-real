ASTRONET: A Plan for European Astronomy  
For many years, discussions have taken place about creating a long-term plan for the growth of European astronomy—covering optical and radio, as well as ground-based and space-based initiatives—but this plan has yet to be developed. Improved coordination among European countries would greatly benefit astronomy. A group of European funding agencies is now starting ASTRONET, a four-year ERANET project aimed at achieving these objectives. European astronomy has seen significant successes since the late twentieth century, largely due to the collaboration of previously isolated efforts into multilateral partnerships, with ESO focusing on ground-based optical astronomy and ESA on space astronomy being the most notable examples. To continue this success in the future, it is essential to strengthen and broaden these joint efforts across all areas of astronomy. This requires a common scientific vision for Europe and a clear plan for astronomical infrastructures. We also need to identify the obstacles that hinder collaborative projects between countries and propose solutions to address them.
