ASTRONET: Working on a Strategic Plan for European Astronomy  
A detailed long-term plan for advancing European astronomy—covering optical and radio fields, both on Earth and in space—has been in discussion for years, but remains to be finalized. Improved coordination among European countries would greatly benefit astronomy as well. A group of European funding agencies is now starting ASTRONET, a four-year initiative to accomplish these aims. European astronomy has seen significant achievements in the latter half of the twentieth century, mainly by uniting previously separate efforts into collaborative partnerships. Key examples of these collaborations are the European Southern Observatory (ESO) for ground-based optical astronomy and the European Space Agency (ESA) for space astronomy. To ensure similar success moving forward, it is essential to strengthen and broaden these cooperative efforts across all astronomy areas. This includes establishing a collective Scientific Vision for Europe and a shared strategy for astronomical infrastructure. We must also identify obstacles that hinder joint projects across countries and propose solutions to address them.
