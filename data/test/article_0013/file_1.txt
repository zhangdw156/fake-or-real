In April and May of 2018, ESO invited scientists to submit proposals for using MUSE NFM adaptive optics (AO) technology for scientific observation verification purposes . After reviewing all submitted proposals by their deadline (May), they chose sixteen successful projects totaling forty-three point five hours worth of observation time that would take place between June and July of that year . Due to lack some reference stars during preparation phase two one project had to be removed from consideration which reduced allotted observation time by five hours , ultimately leading to thirty five hour allocation . This allowed scientists across many fields including those studying young stars , planetary systems , near supernovae , galaxy mergers , supermassive black holes and others who are looking at phenomena like gravitational lensing around quasars or other objects with strong light bending capabilities .
