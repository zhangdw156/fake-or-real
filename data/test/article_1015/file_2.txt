It is now clear that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer us an exciting new viewpoint in relativistic astrophysics and cosmology. The central mechanism of GRBs must generate enormous energies, between 10^49 and 10^52 erg, within a few seconds, enabling a planetary-mass jet of plasma to reach ultrarelativistic speeds. The energy and duration of the initial emission, along with the traits of their parent galaxies and their locations, suggest that both types of GRBs—long and short—could end up in a similar state, featuring a newly formed black hole surrounded by a dense torus. However, the two types result from very different evolutionary processes: long bursts likely come from the collapse of an iron core in a very massive star, while short bursts probably stem from the merger of a relativistic binary system. The afterglows of GRBs can help us study the intergalactic medium during the reionization period by detecting metal systems linked to early starburst winds. High-resolution observations using the UVES instrument are already providing valuable insights into the kinematics, ionization, and metallicity of the interstellar matter in GRB host galaxies up to a redshift of about 4. Further optical and near-infrared spectroscopy should expand this redshift range, potentially reaching back to the reionization epoch. These objectives were key reasons for developing the REM telescope, a robotic, quick-moving facility designed to observe early optical and near-infrared GRB afterglows. However, the Swift mission has revealed that most GRB counterparts are dimmer than anticipated in the optical and near-infrared, necessitating increased use of medium and large telescopes.
