In early 2009, the telescope's supporting system was ready for shipment. However, a serious accident delayed its delivery by causing extensive damage to the crucial mirror cell. After a two-month delay, the shipment resumed, but upon arrival in Chile, it became apparent that moisture intrusion had caused severe issues with the mirror cell. The damaged cell required reimporting to Italy for remanufacture and testing of the entire system, particularly its critical components: the primary mirror supports. This phase was finally completed successfully in April 2010.  The accident pushed back the project timeline by a year. Despite initial expectations, replacing some outdated commercial parts with similar replacements caused unexpected problems that required modifications to the control system. The result was unexpectedly high-performance primary mirror support mechanisms; they offer small differential force adjustments with an accuracy of just ±0.2 Newtons, surpassing expectations. By early 2009, a collaboration between individuals from Padua, Capodimonte and INAF Headquarters, alongside industrial partner Tomelleri srl, completed work on the remaining subsystems: adapter/rotator, probe optics, Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor, atmospheric dispersion corrector were all tested and debugged for electromechanical operation. Meanwhile, technical CCD systems were operationalized. The units were shipped to Chile in mid-2009 and reassembled on site.  Other activities continued as well: the telescope control software underwent improvement and testing using the VLT control model facility at ESO Headquarters; a cabling plan was established and followed during integration; parts of the cooling system needed revisiting due to performance shortcomings; the active optics operating model was studied in detail; wavefront sensing simulations were performed; detailed optomechanical integration analysis was conducted. Software interface with OmegaCAM testing, the transfer function of the axes were measured, and a reasonable agreement between simulation and measurement results (altitude-locked rotor eigenfrequency: 9 Hz) was obtained. Additionally, numerous other smaller tasks were also undertaken.
