Low-Mass Exoplanet Discovered Using Microlensing  
Astronomers, using a global network of telescopes including the Danish 1.5-m telescope at ESO La Silla, have found a new exoplanet that is about five times the mass of Earth and takes around 10 years to orbit its star. This planet is the least massive discovered around an ordinary star and the coolest as well. It likely has a surface made of rock and ice. Its discovery is a significant step in the search for planets that might support life. The microlensing technique relies on the temporary brightening of a background star caused by the gravitational influence of a foreground massive object (either a star or planet) passing in front. The brightening from an intervening star lasts about a month, and any orbiting planets can produce additional signals, which last from days for larger planets to hours for Earth-sized ones. Continuous high-precision monitoring of microlensing events is necessary to detect and study these planets once an event is identified. This specific planet was discovered on July 11, 2005, and monitored until late August when a deviation indicated a planet. The new planet orbits a red star that is five times less massive than the Sun, located about 20,000 light years away, near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. Its cool star and large orbit suggest the planet's surface temperature is around –220° C, which is too cold for liquid water. It may have a thin atmosphere similar to Earth’s, but its rocky surface is likely covered by frozen oceans, making it resemble a larger version of Pluto rather than the rocky inner planets like Earth and Venus.
