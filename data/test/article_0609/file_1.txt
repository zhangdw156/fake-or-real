The researchers steadily increased the power output of their frequency-domain adaptive optics (RFA) system after discovering methods to overcome stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). The initial 4 Watts at 1178 nm was boosted to 39 Watts in August 2009, with a linewidth below 1.5 MHz and an all-fiber system. In the same month, the team achieved 39 Watts of continuous wave (CW) power using a single non-polarizing (non-PM) RFA system.  Additionally, they developed a novel 150-Watt fiber laser pump at 1120 nm to support this output. By year's end, MPBC Inc. in Canada demonstrated a 44-watt output with a single polarizing (PM) RFA using adapted technology from ESO, and the group was able to reach a power of 20 watts at 589nm – the desired level for the Advanced Fiber Telescope (AOF) using four LGS and the E-ELT's LGS system. This achieved record power and intensity output, exceeding typical tolerances in non-SBS-suppressed systems. The spectral properties were measured and displayed on Figure 7, demonstrating a very clean spectrum with more than 45 dB of emission above amplified spontaneous emission and a linewidth below 1.5 MHz.  The laser beam is collimated and mode-matched to a compact resonant cavity; frequency doubling is achieved using a commercially available nonlinear crystal (SHG) unit. The SHG's bow-tie cavity configuration, featuring a 30-mm long LBO nonlinear crystal and a control system based on the Pound–Drever–Hall technique, is known to be suitable for high laser powers without damage concerns. The SHG achieves up to 86% optical conversion efficiency due to both the single mode RFA's diffraction-limited beam quality and low intensity/phase noise behavior. In September 2009, a similar 28 Watts at 589nm was attained with just one RFA and the SHG.  This achieved excellent wavefront quality.
