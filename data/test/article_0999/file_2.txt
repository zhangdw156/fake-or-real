The most notable aspect of the text is that the measured levels of 6Li seem to level out, which contrasts with the expected increase in 6Li based on Galactic cosmic-ray processes. This leveling off could suggest that 6Li originated from the Big Bang, similar to 7Li. However, standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis indicates that the ratio 6Li/7Li is about 10^-5, which is much lower than what has been observed for 6Li. Advances in particle physics and supersymmetry suggest the existence of new exotic particles, like the gravitino. The decay of these particles during the Big Bang nucleosynthesis could change the abundance of light elements if their masses and lifetimes are appropriate. Research shows that releasing high-energy nucleons through hadronic decay approximately 1,000 seconds after the Big Bang can produce more 6Li while still matching the observed amounts of primordial deuterium (D) and helium (He). Additionally, there may be a simultaneous reduction of 7Li levels by factors of 2 to 3. This could explain the observed 6Li plateau and the low levels of 7Li in metal-poor stars, potentially resolving both lithium issues at once. However, this theory relies on unconfirmed physics, and it's important to highlight that our findings for 6Li are on the edge of clear detection. Therefore, more research is necessary to gather additional data, especially for the most metal-poor stars, and to confirm the baseline for the 6Li/7Li ratio measurements.
