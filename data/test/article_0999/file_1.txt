The most notable aspect of the text is that the measured levels of 6Li seem to level out, which contrasts with the expected increase of 6Li based on Galactic cosmic-ray processes. This leveling off could suggest that 6Li originated from the Big Bang, similar to 7Li. However, standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis indicates that the ratio of 6Li to 7Li should be around 10^-5, significantly lower than what has been observed for 6Li. Advances in particle physics, particularly supersymmetry, propose the existence of various exotic particles like the gravitino. If these particles decay during the Big Bang nucleosynthesis period, they could change the expected abundances of light elements, depending on their mass and lifespan. Research shows that energetic nucleons produced by hadronic decay roughly 1,000 seconds after the Big Bang could generate considerable amounts of 6Li without conflicting with the observed amounts of primordial D and He. Additionally, it is possible to simultaneously reduce 7Li by a factor of 2 to 3. This mechanism could account for the observed 6Li plateau and the low levels of 7Li in metal-poor stars, potentially resolving both lithium issues at once. However, this theory relies on unverified physics. Moreover, it should be emphasized that our 6Li findings are on the edge of clear detection, meaning further research is necessary to gather more data, particularly from the most metal-poor stars, and to confirm the reference for the 6Li/7Li ratios.
