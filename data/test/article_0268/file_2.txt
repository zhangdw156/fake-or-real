Understanding how new stars form within a galaxy depends heavily on studying its surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). The submillimeterfar infrared regions play crucial roles because they reveal information about both starlight emissions linked directly with forming stars AND cool clouds containing those building blocks for new stars – molecular gases like carbon monoxide (CO).
While CO provides valuable insights into overall galactic "gas" content even though it's not as abundant itself compared with hydrogen (H2), accurately measuring its abundance requires understanding complex relationships between CO emissions H2 concentrations – something scientists still struggle with due varying factors like temperature metallicity across different types or ages of galactic environments .
To overcome challenges posed by distance limitations when observing distant galaxies using traditional techniques like studying CO emissions directly , researchers also investigate other indirect methods by analyzing subtle variations observed across specific wavelengths called "cold Rayleigh Jeans tail" . However , relying solely upon indirect methods raises questions regarding assumptions made about how much material exists compared with what we see based purely upon luminosity; therefore more detailed observation needed for accurate conclusions about stellar birth rates across different types or ages!
Finally because some distant objects may be too faint for direct observation using conventional tools , scientists also focus specifically on "submillimeter" active galactic nuclei -SMGs - known for having massive amounts of cool matter where they provide valuable data points during periods when our universe was young!
