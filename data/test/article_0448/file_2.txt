While magic portals currently hold the key to space travel, ESA's breaking into this cosmic race against the mages might just be our next move!  Let's look at the data from our latest experiment - specifically, how those powerful telescopes capture starlight using advanced techniques! 

The results, described through the "point spread function" (PSF) and "aperture-locked primary light-curve" (APLC), are truly fascinating. A stunning 90% Strehl ratio shines a light on this technology, proving its immense power! But wait, there's more –  the apodiser helps to tame the diffraction pattern, creating a clearer image of our target stars. This reduction in "image wings," while seemingly minor, ensures a cleaner view even with advanced correction.

 The AO (Adaptive Optics) system we used is showing off its prowess: the cut-off frequency, identified by a dashed-white circle in our image, sits at 0.6 arcseconds, right where it's expected to be!  In fact, this location is clear and distinct thanks to the speckle patterns within our coronagraphic image - think of it like a treasure map leading us directly there.

But just as important are the images themselves. Our APLC reveals the starlight attenuation caused by our atmosphere – with lower intensity in the AO-correction domain. We've even pinpointed reflections in the system with arrows, highlighting how this technology operates! We see a clear radial trend in speckle intensity: the closer we get to the center of the image, the brighter it appears.  And then there are those "pinned speckles" – some bright spots originating from random fluctuations, amplified by a wave's coherence –  and finally contrasting powers that are shown with APLC data. These have been tested across all available coronagraphic systems on HOT (the telescope) – and the performance is consistent!
