The paper describes the Point Spread Function (PSF) and Absolute Photo-electric Line Camera (APLC) images obtained during an experiment. The diffraction pattern of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) pupil, which has a high Strehl ratio (90%), was observed in the corrected PSF. Apodization, used to reduce the intensity of the PSF wings, results in less clearly defined fringes on the image.  The AO cut-off frequency was located at 0.6 arcseconds in the image and is identified by a dashed-white circle. The position of this cut-off frequency is shown clearly in the coronagraphic image due to the intensity gradient in the speckle field. Outside the AO cutoff frequency range, the AO system cannot measure or correct spatial frequencies.  The APLC image demonstrates starlight attenuation and exhibits atmospheric speckles with reduced intensity within the AO correction area. Ghosts originating from reflections in the optical system are labeled using white arrows for clarity.  There is a radial pattern in the speckle intensity. The central part of the APLC image is dominated by diffraction residuals and pinned speckles. Pinned bright speckles located at the position of diffraction rings originate from random intensity fluctuations - residual speckles amplified due to the coherent wave component. Contrasts between 1 x 10^-3 at 0.1 arcseconds and 9 x 10^-5 at 0.5 arcseconds have been demonstrated using the APLC.  All the coronagraphs available on HOT performed similarly in this experiment.
