The h-index is a straightforward but effective measure that offers key benefits over other bibliometric methods: it combines productivity and impact, can be easily calculated using the ADS, and is not significantly influenced by a high number of publications that receive few or no citations or by a small number of papers with very high citations. Thus, the h-index is more balanced than other metrics when considering the usual limitations of bibliometric comparisons. It is crucial to recognize that the h-index depends on the number of years an individual has published, so it should be assessed alongside the m-parameter to avoid skewed interpretations. This also indicates that the h-index can vary by research field. This variation is evident even within astronomy. For example, astronomers working on gamma-ray bursts tend to have higher h-indices than those in other specialties, partly due to the significance of the field and also because of larger collaborations and higher publication rates. If this trend applies to instruments, it may suggest that a specific instrument is versatile enough to generate publications across various astronomical domains. The data in Table 2 indicate that the first-generation VLT instruments have comparable h-indices. They demonstrate such versatility since they are utilized for a range of observations from the Solar System to cosmological studies. However, various biases affecting h(t) must be addressed before making in-depth comparisons. Therefore, our findings regarding the h-index of instruments are considered preliminary.
