The h-index is a straightforward but effective measure that offers key advantages over other bibliometric approaches: it incorporates both productivity and impact, can be easily determined using the ADS, and is not significantly affected by many publications with few or no citations, nor by exceptionally high citations of a small number of papers. Therefore, the h-index is generally more balanced than other metrics when considering the common limitations of bibliometric comparisons. It’s important to recognize that the h-index depends on how many years a scholar has published, and should be used alongside the m-parameter to avoid misleading conclusions. Additionally, the h-index can vary by field of study, which is true even within astronomy. For instance, astronomers working in long gamma-ray burst studies tend to have higher h-indices than those in other subfields, related to the subject’s significance, the size of research teams, and publication frequency. A similar effect regarding instruments could suggest the versatility of an instrument used in diverse astrophysical disciplines. The data in Table 2 show that the original VLT instruments have comparable h-indices, indicating their adaptability for a wide range of observations, from our Solar System to cosmological studies. However, other biases influenced by h(t) must be carefully addressed before making in-depth comparisons. Thus, our findings related to the h-index for the instruments should be seen as initial results.
