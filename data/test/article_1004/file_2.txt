MUSE has many applications in astrophysics, from monitoring the outer planets of the Solar System to studying very distant galaxies. In the following sections, we will provide examples of important scientific applications that drive the instrument’s design. The most difficult scientific and technical challenge, as well as the key factor in the instrument's design, is researching the ancestors of nearby normal galaxies at redshifts greater than 6. These galaxies are very faint and can only be identified by their Lyman-alpha (Lya) emissions. MUSE aims to detect around 15,000 of these galaxies through several surveys that vary in size and depth. The deepest survey will require long observation times (80 hours per area) to detect a minimum flux of 3.9 × 10⁻¹⁹ erg s⁻¹ cm⁻², which is 100 times better than current narrow-band imaging capabilities. These surveys will address several scientific goals: studying faint high-redshift galaxies and determining their luminosity function and clustering properties, detecting Lya emissions from the time of reionization, exploring the cosmic web and reionization process, examining the physics of Lyman break galaxies including their winds and effects on the intergalactic medium, conducting spatially resolved spectroscopy of bright distant galaxies, searching for late-forming population III objects, investigating active nuclei at various redshifts, mapping the growth of dark matter halos, identifying faint sources seen in other wavelengths, and making unexpected discoveries of new object types. MUSE, together with ALMA and JWST, will cover the same fields in multiple wavelengths to provide nearly all the data needed to examine galaxy formation. At lower redshifts, MUSE will create detailed two-dimensional maps of the motions and stellar populations in various types of galaxies in different environments, looking at scales smaller than a kiloparsec and extending well beyond the Coma cluster. This will reveal internal structures, displaying the history of their formation, and investigate the connection between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. MUSE will allow extensive spectroscopy of resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies, greatly improving current methods. This advancement will transform our understanding of stellar populations and will complement GAIA studies of the Milky Way while offering a glimpse of what is possible with an Extremely Large Telescope (ELT).
