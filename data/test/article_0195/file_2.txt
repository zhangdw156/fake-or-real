The world boasts several state-of-the art ground based observatories with massive mirrors capable of capturing deep space information across various wavelengths:
Northern Hemisphere: The Keck telescopes at Mauna Kea are joined by Subaru Gemini North providing unique views across both visible light infrared wavelengths respectively - reaching astronomers from member states within Europe's ESO organization via these institutions . The Large Binocular Tbeletecope atop Mount Graham also contributes valuable data while Gran Telescopio Canarias located near La Palma provides another Northern Hemisphere window into deep space observation using this technology .
Southern Hemisphere: Gemini South observatory near Pachon , Chile , along with VLT located at Paranal further broaden our understanding through observations spanning visible light infrared wavelengths .
International Collaborations: Two major collaborations aim towards building even larger observatories - the Giant Magellan Telescope(GMT) Thirty Meter TMT; both currently under construction; however their locations have been subject changes due unforeseen circumstances .
Cutting Edge Technologies:
Beyond these projects several other exciting projects offer complementary data sets:
James Webb Space Telescope(JWST): Launching soon after Hubble it promises groundbreaking research into distant galaxies thanks its advanced capabilities compared previous space telescopers like Hubble , Spitzer Herschel . NASA is expected release its first images sometime later this year!
European Space Agency Missions: ESA's Gaia Mission aims at mapping positions motions of over one billion stars within our galaxy while Euclid set out explore dark matter using infrared imaging techniques expected completion date is around mid next decade!
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope(LSST): LSST stationed atop Cerro Pachon begins mapping all accessible areas twice weekly starting early next year focusing specifically upon transient phenomena such as supernovae!
New technologies are also being developed :
Cherenkov Telescopes: These sensitive instruments used for detecting high energy gamma ray events emanating from distant celestial objects should become operational soon after their construction has been completed throughout Southern AfricaAustralia
In addition there are numerous other ground based projects currently under development including ambitious initiatives like:
Square Kilometre Array: A project aiming for global collaboration involving both AustraliaSouth Africa aimed towards building one of largest radio interferometers ever constructed! This project promises unprecedented insights into galaxy evolution through its ability capture extremely faint signals coming from billions of years ago..
Other upcoming developments include large single submillimeter dishes situated atop Chajnantor aiming toward observing cosmic microwave background radiation while also expanding our knowledge about dark matter particles... New facilities dedicated specifically measuring cosmic rays alongside an extensive network dedicated toward detecting gravitational waves could significantly advance our understanding about black holes neutron star mergers...
