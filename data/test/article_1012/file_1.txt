Infrared (IR) quasar spectroscopy has a long history, but only recently has it been possible to get high quality spectra in the Hb region for a substantial number of high-redshift sources. ISAAC is the IR imager and spectrograph at the Nasmyth B focus of the Very Large Telescope Unit Telescope 1, which can produce high-quality spectra for quasars with redshifts between 1 and 3 when Hb falls within certain IR "windows." Each spectrum covers a range of wavelengths (IR windows Z, J, H, K) that includes either all or part of the area containing the Hb line as well as the Fe ii 4570 angstrom blend and/or the Fe ii 5130 angstrom blend. Using accurate wavelength calibration is crucial, and we achieve root mean square (rms) residuals of under 20 kilometers per second in all windows, which is similar to the accuracy of low redshift optical spectra with a resolution of about 1000. Observations from four seasons at VLT–ISAAC have allowed us to obtain emission-line parameters for over 50 quasars with redshifts between 0.9 and 3.2. This sample size allows for a substantial analysis of luminosity trends and source distribution in a four-dimensional space. We selected ESO–Hamburg quasars as targets for ISAAC to ensure a well-defined, color-selected sample of sources brighter than magnitude B equal to 17.5. We used two large comparative samples of low-redshift quasars: one with our collection of 215 moderate S/N spectra and another with over 450 of the brightest quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
