Infrared (IR) quasar spectroscopy has a long history, but only recently has it been possible to get high-quality spectra of the Hb region for many high-redshift sources. ISAAC, the IR imager and spectrograph at the Nasmyth B focus of the Very Large Telescope Unit Telescope 1, can provide high-quality spectra for quasars with redshifts between 1 and 3 when Hb falls within certain IR "windows." Each spectrum corresponds to a wavelength range (IR windows Z, J, H, K) that includes most of the Hb region, the Fe ii 4570 angstrom blend, and/or the Fe ii 5130 angstrom blend. Precise wavelength calibration is crucial, and we achieve root mean square (rms) residuals of less than 20 kilometers per second across all windows, which matches the accuracy found in low redshift optical spectra with a resolution of approximately 1000. The VLT–ISAAC spectra collected over four observing seasons have allowed us to measure emission-line parameters for over 50 quasars with redshifts ranging from 0.9 to 3.2. This sample size enables a meaningful analysis of luminosity trends and source distribution in four-dimensional Euclidean space. We targeted ESO–Hamburg quasars for ISAAC observations, ensuring a clearly defined color-selected sample of sources brighter than magnitude B equal to 17.5. We also used two large comparison samples of low-redshift quasars: our atlas of 215 moderate S/N spectra and the 450+ brightest quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
