Since 1998, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) has been working on a conceptual study for a large optical-infrared telescope with a primary mirror diameter of up to 100 meters, called the OWL, named for its exceptional night vision and for being OverWhelmingly Large. What began as a modest assessment of the potential benefits and challenges of this ambitious project gained significant traction over the past four years. Following a resolution by the Council in December, it was agreed to quickly complete the study and have it reviewed by an international panel by the end of 2005. The OWL Study has mostly been an internal ESO initiative, but it has benefited from crucial input from industry and community engagement in two key areas. The first was the development of a comprehensive science case for a 50-100 meter Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) by a broad segment of the community through the European Commission's FP5 and FP6 OPTICON program over the last five years. The second was the initial definition and analysis of potential instruments for the OWL, accomplished through a coordinated effort within the ESO community over the past year. Building any ELT, especially one with a 100-meter diameter, necessitates new technologies through a comprehensive research and development program. Early partnerships with industry have led to advancements in critical design aspects of the telescope, such as the serial production of glass or SiC mirror segments, affordable yet effective position actuators, and large deformable mirrors. These innovations provide a solid foundation for reducing costs significantly, moving away from traditional cost models to a more manageable one, particularly due to the mass production of identical mirror segments and standardized parts. The introduction of second-generation instruments for the VLT four years ago has resulted in the ESO community developing several ELT "pathfinders," including KMOS, Planet Finder, MUSE, and the VLT Adaptive Optics Facility. Much of the associated R&D for this work is being carried out through the OPTICON program.
