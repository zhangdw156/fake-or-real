By the mid-1990s, the potential of the submillimetre wavelength range was proven through the early successes of the 15-meter James Clerk Maxwell telescope and the 10.4-meter Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, both located at 4000 meters on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. During this period, plans for a large millimetre interferometer array were developed in North America, Europe, and Japan, accompanied by extensive site testing. Through these efforts, the 5100-meter high Llano de Chajnantor was identified as possibly the best accessible site on Earth for submillimetre astronomy, outside of Antarctica. The favorable weather conditions at this location led to an expansion of the initial interferometer concept, resulting in the planning of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), which aimed to cover all millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths with good ground transmission. Recognizing the quality of the Chajnantor site, Karl Menten successfully persuaded the Max-Planck-Society to provide funding for an early deployment of one of the ALMA prototype antennas to Chajnantor as a test for ALMA. ESO and the Onsala Space Observatory were ideal partners for this project, given their success with the 15-meter Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope since 1987 at a lower altitude in La Silla. The new ESO Director General, Catherine Cesarsky, and Onsala Space Observatory Director Roy Booth were enthusiastic about the idea, leading to the creation of the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment. After the partners signed a Memorandum of Understanding on 20 July 2001, MPIfR contracted VERTEX Antennen-technik GmbH in Germany to design and build the telescope. Construction began at the high site in spring 2003 and commissioning started in spring 2004. After successfully verifying the telescope's performance, the facility was inaugurated on 25 September 2005. With the telescope operational, ESO took over its management from Rolf Güsten and appointed Lars-Åke Nyman as the Station Manager.
