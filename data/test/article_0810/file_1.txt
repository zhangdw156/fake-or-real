By the mid-1990s, the potential of the submillimetre wavelength range was proven through the early successes of the 15-meter James Clerk Maxwell telescope and the 10.4-meter Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, both located at 4000 meters on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. During this period, plans for a large millimetre interferometer array were made in North America, Europe, and Japan, accompanied by extensive site testing. Through these efforts, the 5100-meter high Llano de Chajnantor was identified as likely the best easily reachable site on Earth for submillimetre astronomy outside of Antarctica. The favorable weather data for this location led to the expansion of the original interferometer concept. Consequently, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) was designed to include both millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths that transmitted well to the ground. Confident in the quality of the Chajnantor site, Karl Menten successfully persuaded the Max-Planck-Society to provide funding for an ALMA prototype antenna to be established there as an initial project. ESO and the Onsala Space Observatory were seen as logical collaborators since they had been running the successful 15-meter Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope at the lower-altitude site in La Silla since 1987. The new ESO Director General, Catherine Cesarsky, and Onsala Space Observatory Director Roy Booth were both enthusiastic about the proposal, leading to the creation of the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment. Following the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between all partners on July 20, 2001, MPIfR hired VERTEX Antennen-technik GmbH in Germany to design and build the telescope. Construction began in spring 2003, with commissioning starting in spring 2004. After confirming that the telescope met expected performance standards, the facility was officially inaugurated on September 25, 2005. Once operational, the management of the facility was assigned to ESO, transferring responsibility from Rolf Güsten to Station Manager Lars-Åke Nyman.
