The key performance requirements for each antenna include 2 degrees of absolute pointing over the entire sky, 0.6 degrees of offset pointing, an overall surface accuracy with a root mean square of 25 microns, and the ability to quickly switch over a 2-degree range in under 1.5 seconds. These specifications are at least comparable to those of current submillimeter radio telescopes, though most, except for the APEX antenna, which closely resembles an ALMA prototype, are sheltered from the elements. The antennas are essential for the ALMA project, with their quality and performance significantly impacting ALMA's overall effectiveness. Due to the importance of the antenna specifications, the AEC Consortium, Vertex RSI, and Mitsubishi Electric Company provided three prototypes, which underwent extensive testing at the ALMA Test Facility in Socorro, New Mexico. Performance assessments were conducted by various international experts, both within and outside of ALMA, who confirmed that the expected performance of the prototype antennas at the ALMA site meets the technical requirements for all three designs. After a Call for Tender for the antennas, the North American partners of the ALMA project, through Associated Universities Incorporated (AUI), signed a contract on July 11, 2005, to supply up to 25 antennas, with an option to increase to 32, with Vertex RSI. Likewise, on December 6, 2005, the ESO Director General signed a contract with the AEM Consortium for 25 ALMA antennas, also with options for up to 32 antennas. Japan has ordered four total power antennas with a 12-meter diameter, equipped with nutators, from the Mitsubishi Electric Company. The twelve remaining 7-meter diameter antennas will be ordered in 2007 by NAOJ. The first antenna from Vertex RSI is expected to be ready for provisional acceptance in Chile in the latter half of 2007, while the first antenna from the AEM Consortium is anticipated by the third quarter of 2008. Despite delays in AEM antenna deliveries, both suppliers are expected to complete delivery of their 25th antenna by the end of 2011. Acceptance for the first antenna from Japan is expected in December 2007. The Preliminary Production Design Review for antennas by Vertex RSI took place in September 2006, and the review for AEM antennas was held in late January 2007.
