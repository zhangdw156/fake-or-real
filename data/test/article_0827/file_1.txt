MICADO is the imaging camera for the multi-conjugate adaptive optics system planned for the E-ELT, as described by Renato Falomo. The team developing MICADO aims to create a simple and reliable device that can address most of the key NIR scientific objectives by the time the E-ELT begins operation. MICADO will operate in the 0.8 to 2.5 µm wavelength range with a field of view of 53 × 53 arcseconds. It has a pixel scale of 3 milliarcseconds (mas) and a PSF FWHM of 6 mas in J-band and 10 mas in Ks-band. Major scientific focuses for the instrument include the Galactic Centre, resolved stellar populations outside the Local Group, and galaxy morphology in the early Universe. MAORY is the multi-conjugate adaptive optics module for the E-ELT, with Paolo Ciliegi presenting on PSF simulations to demonstrate its effectiveness. MAORY has a 150 arcseconds diameter field of view that complements MICADO’s requirements well. Ciliegi noted that the ideal technology for a wider imager on E-ELT covering a 5 × 5 arcminutes area is GLAO, which moves beyond the diffraction-limited MCAO. Olivier Le Fevre showcased surveying options with OPTIMOS, which proposes a 7 × 7 arcminute field of view, operating between 0.37 to 1.4 µm, and maintaining 0.05-arcsecond pixels. This instrument functions primarily as a multi-object spectrometer providing up to 500 multi-slits in the optical denomination and 170 middleslits in NIR, optimally in natural seeing or GLAO. Additionally, there were brief presentations on science applications for the E-ELT, including studies on resolved stellar populations in the Virgo cluster and on various resolved starburst clusters.
