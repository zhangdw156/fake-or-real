MICADO, explained by Renato Falomo, is the imaging camera for the multi-conjugate adaptive optics system of the E-ELT. The consortium developing MICADO aims to create a straightforward and durable instrument that can address as much of the key NIR science as possible by the time the E-ELT begins operations. MICADO will function within the wavelength range of 0.8 to 2.5 µm and will have a field of view (FoV) of 53 × 53 arcseconds. The pixel size is 3 milliarcseconds (mas), while the point spread function (PSF) has a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 6 mas in the J-Band and 10 mas in the Ks-band. Key scientific objectives for the instrument include studying the Galactic Centre, examining the resolved stellar population beyond the Local Group, and investigating galaxy morphology in the distant Universe. The multi-conjugate adaptive optics module for the E-ELT is called MAORY, and Paolo Ciliegi presented the outcomes of PSF simulations. MAORY has a FoV of 150 arcseconds in diameter and can effectively meet the diffraction limit requirements of MICADO. Ciliegi noted that for a wide-field imager on the E-ELT with a target area of 5 × 5 arcminutes, GLAO technology would be needed, which shifts away from the diffraction-limited MCAO domain. Olivier Le Fevre demonstrated the wide-field imaging capabilities of OPTIMOS, which is designed for a 7 × 7 arcminute FoV, covering wavelengths from 0.37 to 1.4 µm, with 0.05-arcsecond pixels. This instrument mainly serves as a multi-object spectrometer that can employ up to 500 multi-slits in the optical and 170 in the NIR, expected to operate either in natural seeing or GLAO conditions. Additionally, two brief presentations on scientific applications with the E-ELT were included: one focused on resolved stellar populations in the Virgo cluster and the other on resolved starburst clusters both nearby and at greater distances.
