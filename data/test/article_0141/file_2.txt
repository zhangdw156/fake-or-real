Since early exoplanet imaging systems like ESO's Nasmyth Adaptive Optics System have improved significantly thanks advancements like SPHERE's higher contrast capabilities (an order magnitude increase), we can now better understand their limitations: how they work internally affects their overall performance compared against stars they observe from light scattered around them called "instrumental structures".
This knowledge helps us optimize future designs for even higher contrast telescopes like those planned for Extremely Large Telescopes (ELT). These limitations include scintillation effects caused by light bouncing off atmospheric turbulence; pupil fragmentation where light becomes dispersed due its shape; temporal errors in adaptive optics system which causes blurry images; noncoherent pointing aperture correction process affecting image quality which requires careful calibration; among others .
To address this challenges specific solutions need development:
Adaptive Optics: Utilizing cameras less susceptible to noisealiasing along with faster data processing algorithms detectors could improve image clarity significantly near stars while reducing blurriness caused by atmospheric turbulence or other factors affecting optical path coherence..
Coronagraph Design: Achromatic coronagraphs capable of handling residual lights from imperfections in their design should be developed along with smaller inner working angles for greater sensitivity across shorter distances between objects being observed..
These improvements are particularly important when considering ELTs due their large size which introduces new challenges such as maximizing central obstruction size while minimizing distortions caused through spider thickness variations or segmentation issues within mirrors causing inconsistencies across each segment..
