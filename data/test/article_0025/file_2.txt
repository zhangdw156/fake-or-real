Figure 1 depicts an organizational structure for managing activities during a project called "4MOST".
The core scientific team (Science Team) handles analysis using data collected through multiple surveys within "4MOST". This team includes principal investigators (PIs) leading each survey involved with this project as well as other scientists working on related projects within "4MOST."
A central steering committee called 'Science Coordination Board' oversees research efforts across these individual surveys while ensuring consistency with overarching goals for "4 MOST" as a whole project . They manage any potential conflict between different research teams or interests while enforcing established policies that guide science within this program .
Day-to-day application of these policies falls under responsibility assigned by this board specifically designated as 'Science Policy Board'. This board ensures smooth coordination among stakeholders involved with both individual projects AND broader program efforts associated with "4 MOST".
To maintain efficiency across various aspects like scheduling observations analyzing data effectively , theres a dedicated group called Joint Operations Group responsible for coordinating activities between ESO (European Southern Observatory), survey PIs, other key personnel involved in .
Infrastructure Working Groups address common needs shared across multiple surveys participating in "". These groups require input from various participants including scientists who will contribute their expertise towards achieving shared goals set out before them . Currently active working groups include those focused on strategy development , selection criteria , pipeline systems used for processing data , etc.. Participation from community researchers will be encouraged so they can benefit directly from existing work being done while contributing their own skills resources towards further development ongoing operation within '".
