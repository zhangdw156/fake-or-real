The aftermath explosions create radioactive materials which emit gamma rays and energetic particles within themselves before depositing their energy into surrounding material if they don't escape out space . The specific mix these isotopes represent is crucial for determining what kind radiation we observe as well as how much material exploded away from its origin . This mixture helps us understand what elements were created during this event along with how much material was released . We already knew about nickel(56), cobalt(57), but we expected titanium(30). Using data from telescopes like VLT HST combined with complex calculations about light absorption by matter we found out titanium played an important role providing energy for years after an event occured . This discovery has been confirmed by observations using NuSTAR INTEGRAL satellites which detected hard X-rays coming from titanium , further confirming its role during this explosive event . Astronomers also observed intricate structures emitting light caused by different atoms located near or illuminated by external sources using instruments like SINFONI HST , giving us valuable insight into where these elements were located at various points after an event occured including one key element responsible for powering a dense core inside our star's remnant.. These observations help us understand how powerful events unfold quickly at first moments then settle down over time - offering clues on what happened inside those stars when they exploded!
