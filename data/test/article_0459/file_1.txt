The first round of talks buzzed with excitement, fueled by breakthroughs in planetary detection! HARPS was in overdrive, churning out a torrent of new planets, including some unexpectedly low-mass ones. This announcement alone sent shockwaves through the scientific community, with press conferences becoming full-blown media storms! It's clear we're just scratching the surface; HARPS predicts that many more exciting planet discoveries are on the horizon, perhaps even up to **a whopping 80% of stars** boast planets under 50 times Earth’s mass!

The morning was also marked by a stunning feat – infrared precision measurements with CRIRES achieved unheard-of accuracy, allowing us to detect planetary movements down to just **a few meters per second**! This opens up a whole new world for studying distant planets and stars. 

Meanwhile, the conference continued to delve deeper into planetary secrets, especially those hiding behind the veil of transits: new evidence showed that many short-period planets orbit in positions drastically different from their stars!  This revelation came not only from ground-based but also space-based surveys, which collectively painted a more detailed picture of our cosmic neighbors. 

Speaking of closer quarters, **direct imaging** finally took center stage.  We witnessed how cutting-edge techniques are revealing new insights about planets' composition and evolution. For instance, new data confirmed the existence of previously discovered planets orbiting in wide paths! And now, the focus is shifting to the fascinating story behind their formation.

But it wasn’t all about finding new worlds – the talk shifted gears to explore advanced detection methods. The power of **astrometric techniques** was highlighted - a method for measuring exoplanets' exact mass and orbit details. We even got to dive deeper into what we know about potential “Earths” and super-Earths, exploring their composition and evolution in light of the incredible discoveries.
