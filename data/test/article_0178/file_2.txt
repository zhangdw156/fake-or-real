The Extremely Large Telescope project is progressing according plan towards its first light target date in early year of the year Here's a breakdown:
Construction milestones: Key infrastructure like roads leading up to Armazones mountaintop platform have been completed along with significant progress on telescope segments like mirrors supports . Final designs contracts are underway or finalized including those related to optics mechanics needed
Procurement process: Significant funding has already been allocated (80 )for various components through external contracts . Additional calls will be issued over next few years covering remaining equipment needs such as specific mirrors , supporting structures , laser systems etc., all crucial components needed before launch
Instruments: Several key scientific instruments will form part this observatory . They include : MICADO, HARMONI, METIS. Each instrument plays a unique role within its respective wavelength range designed specifically around observing deep space phenomena
These elements combined form a robust foundation that promises groundbreaking astronomical discoveries once operational!
