During their two-week stay in Santiago for this astronomy summer school program focused on data analysis techniques relevant for astronomical research projects using telescopes like ALMA or ELT., participants engaged actively with lectures about these advanced topics while also discussing career paths within astronomy as well as presenting their findings alongside their peers. These 20 students from South America had diverse backgrounds ranging from PhD candidates to experienced researchers; they showcased strong teamwork skills throughout their work which culminated into impressive presentations demonstrating an understanding of essential concepts within astronomy research techniques . The program fostered collaboration among its participants through its combined efforts both at ground level as well as at one of Chile's most prestigious observatory sites – ESOs facilities – making it an enriching experience overall thanks to pleasant weather conditions provided by perfect summer days spent together!
