Scientists use various methods like analyzing fluctuations from cosmic microwave background radiation or studying supernovae explosions (geometric tests) to determine how our universe evolved over time â€“ these are key pieces for understanding cosmology today . To get accurate measurements about these changes we need multiple observations combined together because no single method provides complete information about everything that affects our universe's evolution .
The "4MOST" project focuses specifically on studying how things like galaxies form within massive structures called "clusters," providing valuable information about dark energy - an invisible force driving our universe's expansion - through its unique ability to observe distant objects at high redshifts near z1 , something other projects like DESI haven't yet accomplished .
This research relies heavily on identifying individual galaxies within these massive structures using spectroscopic observations - previous studies have helped us understand how these groups evolve over time thanks efforts from projects like SDSS IV but "eRosita" aims even further with its impressive scope looking for over forty thousand groups clusters across vast distances surpassing what was previously possible with traditional methods .
