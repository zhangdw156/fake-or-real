Additional observations of the clusters were made after the initial data set was described. For instance, deep z-band images of both clusters were captured using the ACS camera on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). These images confirm that nearly all (13 out of 14) of our high-redshift candidates are optical dropouts, remaining undetected at a limiting magnitude of 28 to 28.3 magAB. In collaboration with Eiichi Egami, we also obtained IRAC/Spitzer GTO images at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micrometers for a large sample of lensing clusters, including Abell 1835 and AC114. Again, none of our high-redshift galaxy candidates were detected, which is understandable since their blue spectral energy distribution suggests their expected fluxes are below Spitzer's sensitivity. This indicates these galaxies likely do not have 'old' stellar populations with distinct Balmer breaks and are not experiencing significant extinction. A more detailed account of these observations will be shared elsewhere. As a comparison, a brighter lensed galaxy at approximately redshift 7 had previously been detected by Spitzer. Additionally, attempts were made to detect emission lines from selected candidates using near-infrared long-slit spectroscopy with ISAAC on the VLT. These observations are currently labor-intensive, time-consuming, and depend on good seeing conditions. Given the faintness of the expected lines, the strong infrared background, and the need for high spectral resolution to reduce the impact of sky lines, scanning the whole J-band at a resolution of about 3,000 requires five settings and around 10,000 seconds to detect an unresolved line with a flux of (6 to 8) x 10^-18 erg per second per square centimeter at 5Ïƒ with ISAAC. Emission lines were detected in some objects. For example, one of our secondary targets turned out to be a very faint emission line galaxy at redshift 1.68. Other lines were identified as the [O ii] 3727,3729 doublet from an intermediate redshift galaxy. Additionally, several objects showed a single emission line, which could be Lyman-alpha and suggests a redshift compatible with the estimated photometric redshift. However, in these cases, no clear asymmetry typical of Lyman-alpha from lower-redshift starbursts was observed. Searches for more lines in these objects (such as C iv 1550 or He ii 1640 at high redshift, or [O iii] 5007 or H-alpha at low redshift) have yielded no results so far. Consequently, establishing the redshifts of these objects is currently challenging, though high redshift cannot be ruled out. Future, more efficient near-infrared spectrographs should lead to significant advancements in this area.
