The VLT survey gathers data that supports research on star populations, the formation of celestial systems, and the life cycles of stars. This Survey complements the Gaia mission by analyzing detailed abundances for at least 12 elements (Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Sr, Zr, Ba) in up to 10,000 stars with a faintness level below magnitude 15 and additional elements (including Li) for more metal-rich clusters.  The survey probes fundamental nucleosynthetic processes like nuclear statistical equilibrium through various elements and alpha-chain processes through silicon and calcium. The radial velocity precision of the sample varies from 0.1 to 5 km/s depending on the target, with measurements precise enough for relevant astronomical analysis.  This data reveals complete phase-space distributions in clusters of stars, enabling scientists to identify substructures related to merging or star bursts using both chemical and kinematic techniques, while also observing the formation and movement of clusters in galaxies. The survey will yield consistent chemical abundances, rotation rates, magnetic activity and accretion diagnostics for samples of stars within clusters with precise distances, allowing for challenging of current stellar evolution models. This data is carefully curated and archived to ensure maximum future utility for astronomers.
