Starburst galaxies like the Antennae, M82, and NGC 1313 show that star formation happens in a hierarchical pattern. Young stars form within dense clusters, which are then found within larger structures that reflect the structure of the clouds where they formed. These super star clusters (SSCs) and surrounding complexes have a significant impact on the entire galaxy: the stellar population inside them releases UV and infrared radiation; and their remnants from supernova explosions - neutron stars and black holes in binary systems - emit high energy. The same massive star populations contribute energy and chemicals through their winds and explosive events.  A combination of these radiative and kinetic effects is thought to be responsible for the formation of superwinds that may influence new star birth, as well as enrich the space between galaxies. However, studying these smaller clusters requires comparisons of their integrated properties, which are based on two assumptions: 1) The initial mass of stars within the clusters is consistent with what is found locally, and 2)  These clusters follow similar evolutionary pathways compared to those in our galaxy's Local Group. These assumptions are necessary for accurate calculations of age, masses, and star formation rates, as well as understanding feedback mechanisms that cause superwinds on a galactic scale. It was previously thought that galaxies didnâ€™t have SSCs with clear spatial information; but recent observations of the center of our own galaxy revealed the presence of clusters with masses in the range of 104 MA, which are still far smaller than known SSCs.  Despite their importance in galaxy evolution, these small clusters are difficult to study and require comparison across integrated properties based on specific assumptions about their formation and behavior. The discovery of a full SSC predates this recognition within galaxies.
