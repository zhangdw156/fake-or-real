In slitless spectroscopy, there are no small openings like slitlets that let in only a limited part of the sky into the spectrograph. As a result, it is difficult to directly convert pixel coordinates to wavelengths. Spectral extractions for object data must depend on local solutions described in the configuration file. Each object's coordinates, found in the Input Object List, need to be provided to extract its spectrum using aXe. The object's coordinates are corrected for instrumental optical distortions to a reference position in CCD coordinates, which influences the local solution. The Input Object List also includes additional parameters such as the object's size, allowing for specific adjustments to the spectral extraction width for each object. With a consistent instrument setup, the aXe global calibration method enables efficient and mostly automated extraction of multi-object spectroscopy data. The main focus of data reduction shifts to creating the Input Object List. For producing large science-ready data products that fit Virtual Observatory standards, a tool like aXe is crucial. In traditional data reduction, the precision of the instrument's calibration relies on the calibration data gathered alongside the science data. In contrast, the aXe global calibration hinges on the stability of the instrument and the precision of the calibration data needed for the telescope/instrument setup.
