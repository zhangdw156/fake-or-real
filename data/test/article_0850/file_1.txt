In slitless spectroscopy, there are no small openings like slitlets that let in only a limited part of the sky for the spectrograph. This makes it impossible to clearly translate pixel coordinates into wavelength. All spectral extractions rely on local solutions based on the trace description and dispersion solution outlined in the configuration file. To determine these local solutions, an object coordinate (found in the Input Object List) must be given for each object whose spectrum will be extracted using aXe. Considering the optical distortions of the instrument, these object coordinates are converted into a reference position in CCD coordinates, which informs the local solution. The Input Object List also includes other details, such as the object extension, allowing for adjustments to the spectral extraction width for each object. With a stable instrument setup and operation, aXe's global calibration approach enables efficient extraction of multi-object spectroscopy data with minimal supervision. The main focus of data reduction becomes creating the Input Object List. For generating large science-ready datasets to be stored in Virtual Observatory-compliant archives, software like aXe is crucial. In traditional data reduction, the instrumental calibration accuracy is limited by the precision of calibrations collected with the science data. In contrast, aXe's global calibration approach means that accuracy depends on the instrumentâ€™s stability and the precision of its calibration data.
