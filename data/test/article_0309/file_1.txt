The extreme X-ray binary system BP Cru involves a rapidly spinning neutron star feeding off material ejected by its blue giant companion star through an accretion process that creates strong X-rays but makes it difficult to study directly due to its small size compared to our instruments' capabilities at optical wavelengths or near infrared wavelengths which are used by some telescopes . However, researchers have developed techniques like spectral differential interferometry that can provide detailed information about extremely small areas within this systemâ€”in this case just several millionths (microarcsecond) wide around this object because it has such low surface brightness at these wavelengths . Using these techniques combined with data collected by GRAVITY and another telescope called UTs over two hours long they were able to study how light coming from different parts in relation to each other changes over time which allowed them to see an extended distorted atmosphere surrounding BP Crus donor star along with evidence for potential gas streams previously predicted based on observations made in other ways . Finally they were able to measure how accurate their measurements are through comparing them against known values using their toolset which showed that there was only about two millionth difference between where they thought things should be based on what we know about space versus what actually happened based on their observations .
