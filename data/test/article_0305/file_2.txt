ESO started exploring using Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) in their library back around 2015 because researchers need consistent ways to reference scientific datasets as well as published articles like "The Messenger". While traditionally used only on text publications , applying them effectively on dataset citations will make finding information easier improve its quality .
To enable this process efficiently , ESOS partnered up with other organizations like Deutsche Nationalbibliothek (DNB), who offer access through their national registry system called 'Data Cite'. This partnership allowed them develop "ESODOI" - a central hub where departments within ESA could easily generate unique identifiers (DOIs).
The process involves sending requests about specific resources from users through "ESODOI", having those requests processed by "ESODOI", then checking if those requests were successfully registered on 'Data Cite' before notifying users about results.. Finally"ESODOI" creates landing pages associated with each newly minted doi so anyone accessing them will automatically reach relevant information provided by ESODOI .
This project faced challenges such as needing compatibility across different types of resources being managed simultaneously while ensuring all departments could interact seamlessly regardless their specific systems or programming languages used . They solved these problems by creating an adaptable API accessible over HTTP allowing easy interaction between various teams within ESA while ensuring reliable operation even during outages affecting 'Data Cite'. They launched this service back early March , starting off small but growing rapidly since then! Their continuous improvements include adding features like weekly checks on every registered resource's validity link making sure all links remain active long term!
