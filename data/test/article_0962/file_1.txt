GRAAL for HAWK-I

Concept: The Ground layer Adaptive Optics system Assisted by Lasers (GRAAL) is a module intended to provide Ground Layer Adaptive Optics (GLAO) correction for the HAWK-I Near-Infrared (NIR) wide-field camera. GRAAL includes four Wave-Front Sensors (WFSs) for Laser Guide Stars (LGS) and a tip-tilt sensor for a Natural Guide Star (NGS). It samples atmospheric turbulence from four slightly different angles across the instrument's field of view to deliver an average correction that is uniform throughout the scientific field of view. The benefits of GRAAL can be summarized by stating that it allows HAWK-I to operate under better than average seeing conditions most of the time. Under typical conditions, the 50% encircled energy diameter will decrease by 15% in the Y band and 30% in the Ks band across the entire field of view. The system uses a Deformable Secondary Mirror with enough range and flexibility to correct for atmospheric effects, including tip-tilt and stabilization of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) field. Four Sodium Laser Guide Stars are generated by four 50-cm laser projectors on the VLT and detected by four 30 Ã— 30 Wave-Front Sensors. These sensors need to rotate to adjust for pupil rotation at the Nasmyth focus, and they must acquire and follow the corresponding laser spots. A visible tip-tilt sensor is primarily considered, and to prevent obscuring the HAWK-I field of view, the visible NGS will be located outside it. Alternatively, an infrared NGS can be used for sensing tip-tilt errors, selected from within the HAWK-I field of view, using the guide mode of the HAWK-I Hawaii2RG infrared detectors, which read a small area around the IR NGS at a high frequency. Additionally, the correction modes of the Deformable Secondary Mirror and SPARTA are not limited to GLAO and Laser Tomography Adaptive Optics (LTAO). GRAAL features an on-axis high-order WFS subaperture for commissioning and maintenance of the Deformable Secondary Mirror. Figure 2 illustrates the opto-mechanical design of GRAAL and its expected performance. The relative enhancement compared to no correction is shown by comparing symbols for GLAO and no correction. The uniformity of the improvement across the field of view can also be evaluated from the plot on the right.
