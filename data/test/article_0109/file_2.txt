This study uses observations based on carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from starburst galaxies (SMGs) to determine their overall masses using two methods:
Virial Theorem: This allows us estimate how much material exists within specific radii based on how fast it moves relative its center point . This information comes directly from observing how fast different elements move within each system through their respective spectra lines like those emitted by carbon monoxide molecules (CO).
Modeling: By fitting simulated models like rotating disks onto observed spectra lines , researchers were able identify key characteristics like inclination angle (how aligned it is with respect to view), rotation speed (how quickly it rotates), giving them an idea about what kindamountdensity each element comprised .
These findings contribute significantly towards understanding starburst galaxies because they provide insights into:
Galaxy Composition: Determining what makes up each element - stars ,dark matter , or interstellar gaseous material - helps understand other aspects related specifically towards molecular gases present within them .
Conversion Factor: By analyzing existing data for galactic composition via spectroscopic analysis techniques researchers could calculate if there's any difference between known values for Milky Way Galaxy compared with other galaxies at similar distances or redshifts
In conclusion this research highlights how analyzing high resolution images combined with spectroscopic analysis techniques effectively estimates key variables influencing starburst galaxies; however acknowledging limitations due limited samples size present remains important for future research endeavors..
