astronauts found hints at how much water there might be hiding out there! They used information about something called "Cold Molecular Gas" (the name says it all!) along with some fancy math calculations based on how fast things move around inside those clouds! By studying those motions through NASA's powerful telescopes they were able discover some pretty interesting stuff - like how much "fuel" there was for building new stars! They also discovered that different types o f galaxies tend have different ratios between fuel (gas) vs star formation . And guess what? It turns out that their measurements match up really well with other similar objects! They even found out how strong their findings were by carefully analyzing both spacey science facts AND accounting for things like dust clouds or hidden parts because nature has many tricks up its sleeve when it comes together . It was an exciting discovery spacey science could never ignore!.
