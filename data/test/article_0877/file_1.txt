Before the ESO Council approved the detailed studies for the European Extremely Large Telescope project, a meeting took place in Marseille to present and discuss the extensive planning for this project. The conference had 250 participants, including astronomers and engineers. The strong support and feedback from this meeting were crucial for the ESO Council's decision made a few days later and will be utilized in the future. The meeting consisted of three sessions: one focused on science (1.5 days), another on telescope design (1.5 days), and the last on instrumentation (1 day). Following this, summaries of each session, along with a list of speakers and posters, are included. A general discussion occurred on Thursday morning covering various aspects of the project, such as the need for key scientific cases, design trade-offs (like size and image quality), priorities for instrumentation, operating modes, and how the telescope would work alongside other facilities. The discussion concluded with insights from the ELT Standing Review Committee, presented by the ESO Director General. 

The meeting started with sessions focused on the scientific objectives of the European ELT project. Many scientific themes for the ELT have already been developed through the OPTICON network, the OWL science case, and more recently by the ELT Science Working Group. Throughout the 1.5 days of science presentations, these themes were expanded upon, and new ideas were introduced.
