Before the ESO Council approved the detailed studies for the European Extremely Large Telescope project, a meeting in Marseille showcased extensive planning for the project. The event was documented with the attendance of 250 astronomers and engineers. The strong support and detailed feedback gathered from the attendees significantly influenced the ESO Council's decision a few days later and will be utilized in future efforts. The event featured three sessions focusing on science (1.5 days), telescope design (1.5 days), and instrumentation (1 day), and the following articles summarize these sessions along with a list of speakers and posters. A general discussion took place on Thursday morning, addressing various project topics, such as necessary leading science cases, trade-offs in telescope design (like size versus image quality), prioritized instrumentation, operating modes, long-range collaborations, and synergies with other facilities. The discussion concluded with the ELT Standing Review Committee's perspectives presented in the ESO Director General's summary.

Sessions at the meeting started with discussions on science priorities for the European ELT project. Many science themes for the ELT have been established thanks to the OPTICON network, the OWL science case, and the ELT Science Working Group. Over 1.5 days of science presentations at this event, attendees further developed these themes and discussed new ideas.
