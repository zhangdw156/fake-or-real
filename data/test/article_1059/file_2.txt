The ESO Science Archive Facility (SAF) has been running at the ESO Headquarters in Munich since 1991. It houses data from ESO telescopes at the La Silla, Paranal, and Chajnantor observatories. Starting in June 2005, it also includes data from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey, which was taken with the Wide Field Infrared Camera. The SAF is managed by ESO in partnership with the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility and offers access to data from the Hubble Space Telescope for its user community. With a few exceptions, all ESO science observations are kept private for one year. After this period, the archived data and summaries of successful ESO proposals become accessible to the global astronomical community. All calibration data is made public right after the observations. The ESO archive also includes advanced science data products, which are provided to the community through special releases, such as VLT Commissioning and Science Verification data, the ESO Imaging Survey, and Advanced Data Products.
