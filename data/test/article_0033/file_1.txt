god object like red supergiants lose mass before becoming white dwarfs or exploding as supernovae due competition between gravity pulling them back inward versus other forces like shock waves created by their own movement outwards pushing out gas through radiation pressure on dust particles . The resulting complex chemical reactions create unique signatures detectable through observation at different wavelengths . Water plays an important role because its distinct infraredradio wavelengths allow us see how it interacts within those environments . For example , researchers discovered strong signals from ortho water molecules at specific frequencies , revealing insights into their behavior within these star systems . These observations are important for understanding how gas behaves around dying massive star near death events called "supernovae" . Further research continues into probing deeper into both young star forming regions as well as mature ones using techniques like Very Long Baseline Interferometry(VLBI). These techniques help us understand how far away we are seeing objects too! Finally , researchers are investigating new ways using different combinations of energy levels within water molecules that will help decipher even more about what happens during those last stages leading up to death event!
