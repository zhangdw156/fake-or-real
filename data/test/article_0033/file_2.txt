Stars nearing their end stages—like asymptotic giant branch objects—lose mass through powerful winds before becoming white dwarfs or exploding as supernovae . This loss creates complex environments where gravity struggles against forces like shocks caused by explosions within them(shocks), radiation pressure on dust particles(radiation pressure), magnetic fields surrounding them(magnetic fields),and nearby companions(nearby companions). These processes make it possible for chemical reactions unique among other molecules that are found throughout space . Water plays an important role because it has many different ways we can study its properties using different wavelengths like infrared waves radio waves . For instance , astronomers discovered water vapor near O star remnants using infrared light analysis . To get even finer details about those atmospheric layers , researchers use high frequency signals called "rotational" signals which are most visible at frequencies close to what we call "radio waves" when studying molecular hydrogen atoms The discovery that this signal appeared regularly across numerous young star forming areas shows its importance for understanding how our universe works . The signal itself often appears narrow while being quite bright but it also changes over time making it even harder for scientists trying understand what's happening there but recent studies suggest they might come from something called "masers" where energy gets released due to collisions between atoms - similar phenomena seen when studying other celestial bodies Scientists are now able use higher frequency signals than ever before because new technology allows us access information previously impossible without such advanced tools! This new technology opens doors into understanding how individual molecules react within those complex environments making studying things like water even easier!
