On July 11, 2005, the OGLE Early Warning System reported the microlensing event OGLE 2005-BLG-390, which involved a relatively bright G4III giant star. PLANET/RoboNet added it to their target list and began monitoring it on July 25. The microlensing effect peaked on July 31. The plan was to keep observing it until the source star moved out of the Einstein ring. However, on August 10, observers using a Danish telescope noticed a measurement that differed by 0.06 magnitude from what the point source-point lens predicted. They made a follow-up measurement that varied by 0.12 magnitude. Data from OGLE confirmed this deviation observed in Chile. To investigate this deviation, homebase increased the sampling rate at the automated Perth telescope, which began continuous observations once the target was visible. Cloud cover affected observations in South Africa, and when Chile resumed observations, it became clear that the anomaly had ended. Different telescopes continued to monitor the microlensing event. The delayed data from Perth eventually confirmed the brief deviation, adding six more data points to what was already recorded. Combined superconducting additional data from the MOA team produced evidence of a short-term deviation from the expected light curve. Intense modeling efforts began, quickly indicating that a low-mass planet had been discovered. The conduction analysis proved simple for an event with a large source star passing over a planetary caustic. The modeling of photometric data provided the mass ratio and the distance of the planet in relation to the Einstein ring radius. We conducted a Bayesian analysis using Galactic frameworks and a mass function to establish probable values for the lens parameters and discern what type of lens it was (a low-mass main-sequence star or stellar remnant). The median results indicate a host star located within the Galactic Bulge, accompanied by a planet that weighs 5.5 times the mass of Earth and is at an appropriate orbital distance.
