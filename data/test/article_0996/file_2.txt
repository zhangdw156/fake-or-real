On July 11, 2005, the OGLE Early Warning System reported the microlensing event OGLE 2005-BLG-390, which involved a relatively bright G4III giant star. PLANET/RoboNet added it to their target list and began monitoring it on July 25. The microlensing effect peaked on July 31. The plan was to keep observing it until the source star moved out of the Einstein ring. However, on August 10, observers at the Danish telescope noticed a measurement that differed by 0.06 magnitude from the expected point source lens prediction. A second measurement showed a deviation of 0.12 magnitude. OGLE data later confirmed this deviation observed in Chile. To investigate the deviation further, the homebase increased the sampling rate at the automated Perth telescope, which began continuous observations as soon as the target was visible. South African observations were interrupted by clouds, and when observations resumed in Chile, the anomaly was no longer present. Different telescopes continued to monitor the microlensing event. The delayed data from Perth eventually confirmed the brief deviation, adding six more data points to the record. Together with two additional independent points from the MOA team, evidence of a well-documented short-term deviation from a point-lens light curve was established. Intense modeling efforts began, quickly revealing that a low-mass planet had been discovered. The analysis was rather straightforward due to the transit of a large source star over a planetary caustic. Modeling the photometric data provided the mass ratio and the projected separation of the planet in relation to the Einstein ring radius. A Bayesian analysis using Galactic models and a mass function was conducted to establish probability distributions for the lens parameters and to determine the nature of the lens (either a low-mass main-sequence star or a stellar remnant). The median values indicated that the host star had a mass situated within the Galactic Bulge, with a 5.5 Earth mass planet orbiting it at a certain distance.
