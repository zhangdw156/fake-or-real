This research aims primarily at using spectroscopy from both the European Space Agency's ROSETTA Telescope ("eRosita") and an advanced telescope called "Four Most" ("FoursMost") to understand how galaxies form over vast distances across space time .
The main goals include:
Confirming evidence: Using spectroscopy we can verify if faint signals detected by telescopes like ROSETTA correspond directly with actual stars or other objects within distant galaxies . This helps determine accuracy when classifying distant objects into distinct categories like "galaxy cluster" or "galaxy group."
Measuring Distances: Obtaining precise distances helps astronomers calculate luminosity from faint xrays emitted from these celestial bodies providing important clues about their size (mass). This information can then be used alongside other data sets like gravitational lensing surveys that measure how much light bends around massive objects . Through this combination we gain insights into how matter clumps together over time creating new structures such as galactic clusters or even entire superclusters..
Key findings
Mass Calibration: By measuring both dynamic masses using movement patterns observed through starlight distortion (caustic), they aim at establishing accurate relationships between observed properties like brightness or motion against true masses present within those celestial structures.. This helps refine our understanding about gravity itself - particularly its influence on large scale structures such as galactic halos..
Clustering Analysis: By studying millions upon millions individual pairsgroups they hope identify subtle differences across vast scales that could reveal vital information about how dark matter interacts over time resulting in unique patterns throughout space time..
Collaboration Future Research: In addition , researchers plan on combining results obtained through these two separate instruments - revealing new insights into stellar populations throughout our universe!
