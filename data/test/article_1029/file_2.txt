After the successful initial experiment using the Very Large Telescope and the Chandra satellite, which detected simultaneous X-ray and near-infrared flare emissions, new observations of the SgrA* counterpart in near-infrared, sub-millimetre, and X-ray wavelengths have been presented. This involved instruments such as NACO, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Submillimeter Array in Hawaii, and the Very Large Array in New Mexico. For four near-infrared flares, we determined that the time lag between the X-ray and near-infrared flares is no more than 10 minutes, primarily due to the binning width of the X-ray data. The observed near-infrared and X-ray flares from SgrA* can be explained using a synchrotron self-Compton model, which involves the scattering of submillimetre photons by a compact source. The X-ray emission results from the inverse Compton scattering of the terahertz-peaked flare spectrum by relativistic electrons. This model aligns with the previously described relativistic orbiting spot model. Additionally, the possible infrared turnover in the synchrotron spectrum may lead to higher flare rates at longer infrared wavelengths compared to shorter near-infrared wavelengths. The excess flux densities observed in the radio and sub-millimetre ranges might be associated with near-infrared flare activity due to cooling from adiabatic expansion of a synchrotron component. The near-infrared K-band is optimal for studying flare emissions from SgrA* because it offers the best angular resolution and minimizes dust contamination when combined with adaptive optics systems. Future advancements will rely on more successful simultaneous observing campaigns, especially linking the near-infrared and submillimetre data, as there has only been a few hours of overlap between the near-infrared/X-ray data and those from the Very Large Array and Submillimeter Array so far. Comprehensive simultaneous data is currently lacking. Additional polarization data from near-infrared to radio wavelengths, along with sub-millimetre very long baseline interferometry and near-infrared interferometric experiments, are also essential for examining the specifics of the accretion process in SgrA*.
