The quantum efficiency (QE) curves for both detectors were measured in Garching, and the QE ratio is displayed. The flat fields taken before removing Bruce from GIRAFFE validated this curve. The recent flat fields from the ESO archive match well with the laboratory predictions in the red spectrum, but are slightly lower than expected in the blue spectrum. During the commissioning phase, calibrations were performed for all configurations across the five slit systems (two Medusa, two IFU, and one Argus) to recalibrate exposure times. These initial flat fields and arcs helped verify that the current default settings are sufficient for the pipeline to locate and trace the fibers and calculate the wavelength solution. We were pleased to find that the pipeline, using the default settings, successfully processed all wavelength ranges shorter than 650 nm. A first attempt was made to reduce a flat and an arc spectrum using the Geneva pipeline, and the reduction proceeded without issues. This suggests that others using this pipeline will likely succeed in the future. The static calibration database was developed and installed at Paranal Observatory, with a public release of the new calibration database planned shortly. Quality Control pages, containing the QC information generated by the pipeline, are currently available.
