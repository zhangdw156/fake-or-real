The quantum efficiency (QE) curves for both detectors were measured in Garching, and the QE ratio is displayed. Flats taken before Bruce was removed from GIRAFFE were used to confirm this curve. For the recent flats found in the ESO archive, the match between observations and lab predictions is strong in the red spectrum but slightly lower than expected in the blue spectrum. During commissioning, calibrations were performed for all setups across the five slit systems (two Medusa, two IFU, and one Argus) to readjust exposure times. The initial flats and arcs helped us verify whether the current default parameters were sufficient for the pipeline to identify and trace the fibers and compute the wavelength solution. We were pleased to find that the pipeline could reduce all wavelength settings below 650 nm with the default parameters. A first attempt was made to reduce a flat and an arc spectrum using the Geneva pipeline, and the reduction proceeded smoothly. This suggests that future users of this pipeline will likely succeed as well. The static calibration database was established and installed at Paranal Observatory, and a public release of the new calibration database will occur shortly. Quality Control pages are available, updated with QC parameters generated by the pipeline.
