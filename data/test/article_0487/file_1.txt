During its growth stage (AGB), stars experience rapid helium burning within a shell around their core. This process, called a thermal pulse (TP), occurs sporadically over short periods lasting a few hundred years.  The release of extra energy causes the star's structure to change, leading to new element formation inside the star (primarily carbon and elements produced in the s-process). These new elements mix into the stellar surface and are incorporated into the stellar wind. This process contributes to chemical evolution within the circumstellar envelope (CSE). Specifically, additional carbon mixing changes the star from oxygen-rich AGB stars (with a C/O ratio less than 1) to carbon-rich AGB stars (with a C/O ratio greater than 1).  Because these pulses are short and occur infrequently between other time periods, they are unlikely to be directly observed. Therefore, models of TPs rely primarily on theoretical predictions. The increased mass loss rate during the TP creates a shell that can gather previously ejected material. This is why detached shells may appear around certain carbon-rich stars.  Scientists study these detached shells through observations in molecular emissions and by analyzing stellar dust scattered light at optical wavelengths. Extensive studies have shown how important AGB stars are for regulating matter's flow in the universe, although many questions remain unanswered. While it is known that these stars lose a large portion of their mass through stellar winds, the precise mechanisms and geometries involved with the expulsion of this material and the dust and gas content of the CSE still need to be clarified.  In prevailing theory, the stars release mass primarily due to radiation pressure exerted on dust grains within the inner CSE. Collisions between dust particles and gas molecules contribute to the overall process of stellar wind. Studying these interactions through detached shells allows researchers to investigate the evolution of dust and gas, along with their role in the mass loss process occurring during AGB stages.
