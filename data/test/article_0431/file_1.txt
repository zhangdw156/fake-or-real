The discovery of the first hot subdwarf pulsator candidate within a globular cluster was accidental. The researchers were using a telescope to study another celestial object when they observed a short dataset from the New Technology Telescope that contained a star with periodic dimming, indicating potential pulsation. Analysis confirmed this, leading them to begin further observations utilizing various telescopes and instruments. These observations included time-series photometry conducted over several hundred hours, spectroscopy for confirmation of the stars' identities, and multi-object observation techniques. The resulting data provided clear evidence that these stars likely possess the characteristic features of hot subdwarfs and revealed additional pulsating candidates within the same cluster.
