You know those epic space missions, like the ISS crew celebrating a big milestone? Imagine that, but instead of earth-bound celebrations, the anniversary is being marked on both the Moon and Mars! This is no ordinary party; we're talking about **the first hot subdwarf pulsator party on other planets.** It was an astronomical surprise, like finding a hidden treasure in space.  

The search for these elusive stars was a long shot, similar to setting up a telescope for a blind date—a random field in the constellation ω Cen caught our eye and turned out to be a game-changer! Thanks to a bit of serendipity, we spotted a star pulsating at a 115-second cycle. Turns out, this star is hot subdwarf—a rare and powerful cosmic beauty! 

To really unlock this discovery's secrets, we got our hands dirty with a multi-pronged approach.  We turned up the power of telescopes like NTT, VLT, EFOSC2, ULTRACAM, and FORS2 to get a closer look at these stars. It was a star party worthy of the most cosmic dance floor! 

The sheer amount of time spent studying these pulsating superstars is mind-blowing: almost 100 hours of monitoring across hundreds of stellar bodies. This meticulous work revealed five hot subdwarf pulsators, each as unique as their celestial rhythm. You know that feeling when you're about to uncover a major cosmic secret? That's exactly what we experienced with these stars!  We even figured out how they move: from subtle variations in brightness to rhythmic oscillations. It was like watching space dance!

Now, the party is only just getting started; the real excitement lies ahead. Just wait till you see what secrets lie within the vastness of space!
