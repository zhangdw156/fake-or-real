ESO Reflex: A Management System for Astrological Information Manipulation  
ESO Reflex is a software application designed for improving how astronomical data is reduced. It visualize the reduction process as a graphical workflow that users can intuitively engage with without needing to write complex code. The graphical interface lets users alter existing workflows or create new ones. ESO Reflex can flexibly call common ESO data reduction methods. It also allows users to integrate Python scripts, IDL functions, and shell commands into their workflows, along with providing multiple visualization and display options, including ways to examine and validate custom products. ESO Reflex was developed during the Sampo project, a collaboration led by ESO involving a Finnish software development team as part of their contribution to ESO. This software is expected to be available for public use by the end of 2008.
