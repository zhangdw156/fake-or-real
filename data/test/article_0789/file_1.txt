ESO Reflex: A Visual Workflow Tool for Processing Astronomical Data  
ESO Reflex is a software application designed to offer a new method for processing astronomical data. It presents the reduction process as a visual workflow that users can easily follow and manipulate without needing complicated coding. The graphical interface enables users to adjust existing workflows and create new ones. ESO Reflex can flexibly utilize standard ESO data reduction methods, and it can incorporate Python scripts, IDL procedures, and shell commands into workflows. Additionally, it provides various visualization and display options, including steps for custom product inspection and validation. ESO Reflex was developed as part of the Sampo project, a three-year initiative led by ESO, with contributions from a software development team in Finland as part of joining ESO. The software is expected to be made available to the public in late 2008.
