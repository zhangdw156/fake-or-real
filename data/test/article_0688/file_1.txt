The amount of water vapor present in the atmosphere, often measured in millimeters from the ground up, significantly affects how clear the infrared (IR) and submillimeter wavelengths of light are. This parameter is crucial at ESO's observatories due to the deployment of new technologies like the Atacama Pathfinder EXplorer (APEX) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).  

For these facilities, measuring water vapor requires specific instruments that determine the amount present in line-of-sight. This is critical for accurate data analysis and operation of the ALMA antennas as an array. The VLT Imager and Spectrometer for mid-IR (VISIR) instrument at Paranal, installed on a dedicated platform in 2011, utilizes a specialized microwave radiometer to provide this information. 

While there are multiple methods to determine atmospheric water vapor content, APEX, ALMA, and the upgraded VLT Imager on Paranal have adopted microwave radiometers as operational monitors. They all utilize similar technology which observes a strong H2O emission line at 183 GHz, making it possible to measure moisture even in very dry conditions. The median values for this parameter at both locations are 2.5 mm and 1.2 mm respectively.

The combination of precise receiver technology and the observed water vapor lines ensures reliable data on PWV under all conditions, especially since extremely dry conditions offer the best atmospheric clarity. For these specific observatories, this is a key factor as they are equipped to observe at high frequencies that become accessible only in the driest atmosphere. The study compares measured PWV with a publicly available model (the Global Forecast System from the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration) to understand how accurate this prediction system is for long-term scheduling purposes.
