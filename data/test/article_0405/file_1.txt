Star distributions on CMDs (Color-Magnitude Diagrams) indicate multiple stellar populations. Main sequence stars, which become increasingly massive and brighter, exhibit a bluish conic structure that gradually shifts towards red colors as brightness increases. This structure merges with the red giant branch at around 2 magnitudes below the red clump. The red clump, a circular region of high star concentration, marks the beginning of the red giant branch's continuation. As magnitude increases, the red giant branch's structure becomes narrower and transitions to reddish colors. A sharp density change occurs near the tip of the RGB, marking the transition from red giants to bright asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Stars below the RGB, representing Milky Way stars, have a distinct characteristic compared to LMC stars. Cepheid and supergiant stars are located on the upper portion of the diagram, close to the blue end of the RGB. RR Lyrae stars occupy a fainter region near the red clump's location and lie parallel to the sub-giant branch.
