The way we look at how much light comes from this object called an astrobiological mission or something like that has helped us figure out some mysteries about how these machines work on earth! But we are still learning about how they work! And we need better ways to study them too! For example scientists used new technology called ground based telescopes on earth so they could see things like clouds made up out there! But there are still some tough questions left unanswered about these amazing machines called space telescopes . . . So what can you tell me about them? I am waiting for your answer so I can help you learn even more exciting facts about them also know what else you want to know !
