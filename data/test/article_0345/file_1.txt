NGC 1068 is a well-studied active galactic nucleus known for its bright luminosity caused by matter falling into a supermassive black hole at its center. Observations showed it emits polarized light from its nucleus which helped scientists develop models explaining why some galaxies are classified as "Seyfert type" based on how much material obscures or scatters light from their centers depending on our view point . The understanding about what makes up these dusty regions around black holes has changed significantly since early studies using various telescopes revealed complex structures within them . Recent observations with powerful telescopes combined with advanced computer modeling help us understand how these structures interact with light across different wavelengths , including infrared radiation captured by instruments like MIDI on VLTI . However, studying smaller regions within these dusty clouds remains challenging because we need more sophisticated methods to observe them directly through infrared radiation emitted by hot particles close to black holes . Until recently , we lacked direct evidence for specific spatial patterns within these hot regions found around NGC 1068 thanks to new observations made using GRAVITY telescope which provides high resolution images allowing us see finer details than before .
