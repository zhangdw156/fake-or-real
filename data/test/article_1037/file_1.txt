FriOWL is a tool designed to monitor climate trends, developed for ESO by the Department of Geography at the University of Fribourg. Its main purpose is to identify the best areas around the world based on long-term averages of various climate factors. It also evaluates seasonal changes in these factors for specific locations and analyzes their response to long-term climate change. FriOWL calculates the anomaly coefficient for each climate parameter compared to its long-term average. This geographical information system has a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees (approximately 300 km), with multiple climate layers that include a minimum of 15 years of monthly average data (the ultimate goal is 45 years for all variables). Analyzing temporal changes among these layers provides insights into seasonal and long-term climate behaviors in selected regions. The layers were specifically chosen based on how sensitive ELT science is to different atmospheric factors. FriOWL Version 2.1 focuses primarily on global climatological data, known as reanalyses. These reanalyses represent the best current understanding of the global atmospheric system at any specific time and reconstruct daily weather patterns from the 1950s to today, using advanced numerical weather prediction and assimilation models. The reanalysis data are sourced from two main centers: the joint National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research in the USA and the European reanalysis products from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting. The FriOWL database also includes additional data, such as Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) from NOAA and the Aerosol Index from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) satellite. Version 2.1 of the FriOWL database contains monthly average data, spanning 15 to 55 years, based on the variable in question. Future updates may feature higher temporal resolutions (e.g., daily, or possibly every six hours). Most of the NCEP/NCAR parameters date back to 1948, providing over 50 years of reliable data. The ERA dataset used in FriOWL 2.1 mainly incorporates information from the ERA-15 project, a reanalysis that covers the years 1979 to 1993. A newer and longer reanalysis, known as ERA-40, which covers 44 years from September 1957 to August 2002, has recently been released and may be included in a future version of FriOWL.
