FriOWL is a tool designed to monitor climate trends, developed for ESO by the University of Fribourg's Department of Geography. Its main purpose is to identify the best areas around the world based on the long-term averages of various climate factors. It also estimates seasonal changes in these factors for specific locations and analyzes their response to long-term climate change. FriOWL calculates the anomaly coefficient for each climate parameter compared to its long-term average. This geographical information system has a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees (approximately 300 km) and consists of various climate layers that include at least 15 years of data presented as monthly averages, with a goal of having 45 years of data for all variables. Studying the changes over time in these layers provides insights into the seasonal and long-term climate patterns of selected regions. Each layer was chosen based on how sensitive ELT science is to different atmospheric factors. The latest version, FriOWL 2.1, focuses mainly on global climate data known as reanalyses, which represent the best available understanding of the global atmosphere at any given time. These reanalyses reconstruct daily weather patterns from the 1950s to the present, using advanced weather prediction models. The data primarily comes from two centers: the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research in the USA and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting. Additionally, the FriOWL database includes data such as Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) from NOAA and the Aerosol Index from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) satellite. The FriOWL database (version 2.1) provides monthly average data over a range of 15 to 55 years, depending on the variable, with plans to include higher temporal resolutions later on. Most parameters from NCEP/NCAR start in 1948 and cover over 50 years of reliable data. The ERA dataset used in FriOWL 2.1 is mainly from the ERA-15 project, which spans 1979 to 1993. A newer 44-year dataset called ERA-40, covering September 1957 to August 2002, has recently been released, and we aim to include it in a future FriOWL version.
