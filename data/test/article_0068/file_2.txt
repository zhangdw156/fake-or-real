AMBER research has significantly advanced our understanding of how young stars gather matter from their surroundings through observations like spectroscopic analysis and images showing discs around these objects at incredibly fine detail (2 milliarcseconds). This research provides evidence that discs are crucial for efficient mass accumulation even among massive luminous stars due to their inherent properties observed through visibility measurements which show specific patterns related to material deposition near stellar surfaces or even jet launches near these celestial bodies . The complex interplay between these processes makes studying bright young star systems ideal using techniques like spectro interferometry which allows us to study them further . These findings have led researchers towards organizing conferences dedicated specifically towards understanding intermediate mass pre main sequence star systems as they represent an important area within this field .
