The XXL survey has observed two extragalactic regions covering 25 square degrees using XMM observations. These observations had a sensitivity limit of 5 × 10–15 erg s–1 cm–2 in the 0.5–2 keV band, and represent the largest project approved to date by the European Space Agency (ESA). The survey has been complemented with observations at various wavelengths using ground- and space-based facilities from ultraviolet through radio.  The spectroscopic follow-up is significant, with the European Southern Observatory (ESO) contributing substantial resources. As of December 2015, the survey has detected approximately 450 new galaxy clusters at redshift values between 1.5–2, and more than 22,000 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z ~ 4. The primary objective of this project is to determine the equation of state for dark energy using these clusters of galaxies as a testing ground.  This survey will offer valuable results in understanding cluster scaling laws and studying AGNs and their relation to the X-ray background.
