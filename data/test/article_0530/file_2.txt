Our findings from both precise Hubble Space Telescope data and multiple MS discoveries have produced exciting new insights into the formation and development of massive star clusters. However, many unanswered questions still exist about these clusters.  For instance, we need more information on what causes contamination in these star-forming regions, the duration over which they accumulate matter, whether pristine material exists that could dilute the polluter's effects, how GCs form and interact with the galactic halo, and how different populations within them influence their dynamic evolution. Additionally, we require a better understanding of the link between multiple populations and other key features of these clusters such as mass, second parameter on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and blue/red sequence distribution, as well as connecting GCs to the nuclei of dwarf galaxies. The VLT, with its advanced capabilities, is expected to remain crucial in future studies of these stars. Observations using UVES and FLAMES significantly changed our understanding of the stellar clusters; X-shooter's high sensitivity now offers exciting possibilities for studying faint stars and near-infrared observations from CRIRES provide additional information about these objects.
