**Yoda's Fundtion and the Curious Case of Tatooine's New Master**

The ESO proposal process for telescope time uses a philosophy remarkably similar to the methods employed by other observatories, both on Earth and out among the stars. Think of it as sorting through hundreds of light-years worth of stargazers' dreams – each one vying for a slice of that limited galactic real estate.  There are various categories: "Normal", "Large", "Guaranteed Time" (GTO), and even "Calibration and Target of Opportunity" (ToO). We've bid farewell to the 'short proposals' category, and those pesky "Director's Discretionary Time" (DDT) requests have gone their separate way.  The whole process is broken down into two phases: "Phase 1: Proposal", where all the dreams are dreamt up, followed by "Phase 2: Detailed Scheduling Preparation," the hard part begins with actual planetary alignments and astrological considerations. This stage determines the technical feasibility of your galactic aspirations. On average, a panel deals with around 70-80 proposals before settling on an answer –  it’s all about meticulous planning before you even leave your Tatooine homestead for the stars.

But what's left unanswered is... **Yoda's involvement.** I hear whispers of his recent activities on Tatooine, and my curiosity has grown into a full-fledged stargazing frenzy. 


**Transparency and Oversight: The Real Deal**  

The process involves careful triage – a sort of galactic “survival of the fittest”. All proposals are first judged by a panel of experts, who assign an initial "pre-OPC" grade. From here, only those deemed worthy enough for full panel review continue. Those who don’t make it past this initial hurdle will be sent to their respective planetary orbits.

A 30% "triage threshold" determines which proposals receive further consideration. The process is transparent and open to scrutiny – a critical factor in preserving the integrity of our galactic endeavor.  What happens after these judgments is where we truly find our footing! After panel discussions, the best proposals are selected based on these grades – ensuring that the brightest stars are given their due shine.

Of course, even the most well-planned and carefully constructed space travel requires a skilled hand to guide it through the vast and turbulent cosmos of opportunity and ambition. 


**A Word About Calibration and ToO Requests**
The process is not confined to simply submitting proposals - it's all about execution! Calibrations and Target of Opportunity (ToO) requests also receive dedicated attention within the ESO framework, ensuring we cover every cosmic corner.

As for your interest in **the fate of these "large" proposals?**, you can find detailed information on those specific proposals – I hear rumors they're headed to a secret location that resembles an old Sith temple...  Let’s just say the universe is full of mysteries, even when it comes to our fellow space travelers.
