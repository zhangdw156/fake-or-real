The European Southern Observatory (ESO) uses a process similar to those employed at other ground-based and space-based observatories for ranking proposal requests for telescope time. This process includes several categories: Normal, Large, Guaranteed Time (GTO), Calibration and Target of Opportunity (ToO). Proposals categorized as short have been discontinued. Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) proposals are handled separately, not discussed in this group, and are handled by a different process. 

The process consists of two phases: Phase 1 (proposal submission) and Phase 2 (detailed scheduling preparation), with technical feasibility assessment occurring after Phase 1 before Phase 2.  On average, a panel reviews around 70–80 proposals within four weeks. All members are required to assign a pre-OPC grade for each proposal before the meeting. The panel chair is responsible for first reviewing approximately 12–15 proposals of which they'll need to present at the panel and provide comment afterward, ensuring a comprehensive review for their assigned proposals.

 Based on the pre-OPC grades, the lowest 30% are eliminated from discussion during the panel meeting. If members deem a particular proposal worthy, they may request to discuss this proposal after triage.  At a 30% triage threshold, it is unlikely that any triaged proposal would be unfairly excluded from the panel discussion.  Proposals with a post-meeting grade of 5.0 were rejected, including those triaged based on their pre-meeting grade and not eligible for scheduling. All other (non-triaged) proposals are discussed during the panel meetings. Scheduling is determined by the grades assigned by the panel.

The Official Process Committee (OPC) primarily focuses on discussions about Large Programs (LPs). A sub-committee within the OPC deals with ToO requests based on the pre-meeting grades provided by the panels, and then determines which LPs are accepted. Calibration proposals are infrequent and are discussed only by the OPC.
