To study star formation in distant galaxies at redshifts between roughly .3 and .17, we used two methods: acquiring new observations with the KMOS instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT) as well as analyzing existing data collected by MUSE on another telescope also operated by ESO - the VLTs Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). KMOS uses many independent infrared cameras to capture images over large areas; this allows us to study many distant galaxies quickly compared to previous methods while MUSE covers optical wavelengths over larger fields allowing us to detect emission lines from these distant stars even without targeting them specifically during observation sessions with both instruments combined we have found significant information about how rapidly rotating these distant stars are.. Our findings are published in multiple papers based on observations from three different surveys conducted through both instruments .
