We used two methods to study about how objects form stars at great distances away from us ("faraway") - namely:
China Special Target Plate Observation: We used China's Chinese relais relay system to observe specific groups or "targets" through China' Chinese Relay Relay System with its own unique instruments designed specifically for this purpose.) This allows us to make measurements about how these objects evolve over time as they form stars more quickly than ever before!
Multisite General Purpose Science Data Collection: We also collected data using several different telescopes across various parts Chinas territory where they were acquired via various modes such as ground based or space based observatories such as European Southern Observatorys Classless Object Streamer Spectroscopic Survey (Classless Object Streamer Spectroscopic Survey). The combination allows us to get a wider range dataset allowing us to make much more informed conclusions about these distant objects .
These datasets allow us t study how fast these ancient stellar nurseries formed their first generations off massive amounts or "starchild" like little neighborhoods bursting with activity!
