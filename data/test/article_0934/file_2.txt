The efficiency of a radio telescope in linking to an astronomical source depends mainly on how smooth its parabolic reflector is. The classical Ruze formula explains that efficiency decreases exponentially with wavelength, and at a wavelength of 15 times the size of the antenna, the coupling efficiency drops to half its maximum. To function efficiently in the last classical atmospheric windows (around 300 micrometers in wavelength), the APEX requires its surface to be smoother than 20 micrometers on average. This means that the deviation of the surface from a perfect parabola over the 12-meter diameter must be less than one-fifth of the width of a human hair, posing a significant challenge for its manufacturing and setup. After assembly, VERTEX pre-aligned the main reflector to a surface accuracy of 35 to 40 micrometers using optical photogrammetry. Subsequently, the APEX holography team conducted near-field holography with a 92.4 gigahertz transmitter located near the summit of Cerro Chajnantor at a 13-degree elevation angle. Over three sessions (May and June 2004, April 2005), they measured phase errors and created surface error maps to adjust for misalignments and flexures of the panels. Adjusting the 130 vertical elements typically took a full workday, varying with environmental conditions, and teams worked in shifts. By April 2005, the surface was confirmed to have an impressive smoothness of 15 micrometers toward the transmitter. However, due to gravitational changes, the antenna's performance would decline at higher elevations. To address this, a finite-element model of the APEX dish was used to preload and optimize the surface for the elevations that would be used for observations. The effective surface smoothness at elevations between 30 and 80 degrees was calculated to be 17 to 18 micrometers, supported by accurate measurements of the telescopeâ€™s coupling efficiencies. This makes APEX a high-quality telescope that performs well within its specifications, enabling observations in the supra-terahertz range.
