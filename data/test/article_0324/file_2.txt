To calculate molecular excitation in LimeSolver using ARTIST software: users input their desired parameters like molecule type and collision data into Artist which then uses an internal tool called LIME for calculations.. LIME is a Monte Carlo program capable of handling both LTE (traditional) NLTE (non-equilibrium temperature) conditions by utilizing flexible grids within its simulation process . Users must specify details such as grid resolution iteration count along with desired temperature conditions before starting calculations . These results are then saved in a separate file by LimeSolver after completion which allows users to continue further analysis within their work flow .
