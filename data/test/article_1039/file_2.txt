Data centres play a crucial role in the Virtual Observatory (VO) because they are the main source of astronomical data. The VO cannot control how a data centre manages its archive. However, a “VO-layer” is needed to convert local terms to standard terms. For instance, different data centres may define right ascension differently, but VO users need to be able to identify which parameters in an archive interface correspond to right ascension. The long-term goal of the VO is to simplify information by focusing on astronomical measurements, like “wavelength range,” instead of specific grism or filter names. Data providers are encouraged to systematically gather metadata about their curation process, give unique identifiers, summarize the contents of a collection, and describe the parameters of public services. The VO is most effective with high-quality “science-grade” data, minimizing complex data reduction for users. Therefore, data centres should strive to provide such data. These requirements also impact the European Southern Observatory (ESO). In response, the Data Management and Operations Division established the Virtual Observatory Systems Department on November 1, 2004. VOS is tasked with overseeing ESO's participation in VO activities and enhancing the Science Archive Facility as a useful scientific resource for the ESO community. Currently, the department includes the Virtual Observatory Technology and Advanced Data Products groups and consists of thirteen members.
