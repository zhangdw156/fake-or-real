Data centres play a crucial role in the Virtual Observatory (VO) because they are the main source of astronomical data. The VO cannot control how a data centre manages its archive. However, a "VO-layer" is needed to convert local parameters to standard ones. For instance, different data centres may define right ascension differently, but VO users need to know which parameter from an archive interface represents right ascension. The long-term goal of the VO is to eliminate specific details related to observatories, telescopes, or instruments, and to work using astronomical units, such as "wavelength range" instead of specific grism or filter names. Data providers are encouraged to systematically gather metadata about the curation process, assign unique identifiers, describe the general content of their collections, and provide details about the interfaces and capabilities of their public services. Moreover, the VO will be most effective with high-level or "science-grade" data, minimizing the complexity and time required for data reduction for users. Data centres should strive to provide this type of data. These considerations also apply to the European Southern Observatory (ESO). To address these issues, the Data Management and Operations Division established the Virtual Observatory Systems Department on November 1, 2004. The role of the VOS is to manage ESO's participation in VO activities and enhance the Science Archive Facility as a valuable scientific resource for the ESO community. Currently, this new department includes the Virtual Observatory Technology and Advanced Data Products groups, consisting of thirteen individuals.
