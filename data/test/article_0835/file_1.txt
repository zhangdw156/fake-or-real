Spain's future in astronomy looks bright due to its membership in the ESO. Activity in the field continues to grow rapidly. The main strength of Spanish astronomy, its skilled workforce, is in good condition, with new generations of talented and eager astronomers being brought in. One of the main challenges now is to integrate these newcomers into the research and development system. Operating and maintaining the GTC remains a top priority for Spain. There are many ideas for second-generation scientific instruments to accompany EMIR, which will be the first operational near-infrared multi-object spectrometer. FRIDA, which will use the adaptive-optics facility at the GTC, is among the top proposals. Spain aims for the GTC to be a leading facility in the era of the ELTs. Alongside the GTC, smaller optical telescopes will also be important for balanced development, as they can perform certain observing programs more efficiently than larger telescopes and will need to be outfitted with the right instruments. Luckily, Spain has access to several telescopes in the 2â€“4-meter class. Future ground-based astronomy infrastructure will require investments totaling around a billion Euros. By joining ESO, Spain reaffirms its commitment to the ALMA project and will actively contribute to the realization of the European ELT. Spain brings its experience from building the GTC and other facilities to this initiative and has the opportunity to host the E-ELT at its top observatory, the ORM in La Palma. Additionally, Spain is also considering participation in the Square Kilometre Array, another major international facility.
