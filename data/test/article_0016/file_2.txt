During their long mission planning phase they encountered unexpected issues with their telescope's ability to block starlight using its "coronograph" filter system - specifically its effectiveness deteriorated over time despite initial expectations for significant improvement due to some internal factors not initially accounted for . This issue defied conventional explanations like external factors affecting its operation so they investigated potential internal causes such as leaks allowing cold gas inside leading potentially forming ice within its intricate structure causing light blockage . To address this problem they devised an innovative workaround involving manipulating low temperature stages within their telescope's control system - essentially restarting brief cooling cycles periodically rather than letting them run completely - This proved successful allowing them effectively mitigate these issues while maintaining operational readiness . They then successfully implemented this strategy throughout their mission , successfully restoring optimal performance before each new observation session .
