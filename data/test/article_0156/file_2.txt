astronauts landed safely aboard their capsule today! Astronauts are being prepared for their return journey back home after spending several months aboard this unique vessel designed specifically for long duration lunar exploration! The crew is scheduled to splash down off Floridas coast within a window starting tonight...
Let me know if you need further details about this exciting mission!
This is just what we are planning right now - I'm not able yet provide any specific details about how it will go up there or what they will do there... But I am really excited about it!!
I hope this helps!
