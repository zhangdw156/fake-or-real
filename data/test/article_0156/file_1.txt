Before installing NAOMI equipment at Paranal Observatory's telescopes some preparations were made by scientists who thoroughly tested all systems beforehand using simulations or by talking about their plans directly with observatory personnel responsible for each task involved . This careful planning ensured all parts needed for successful installation would work properly even if some delays occurred . To make sure everything went smoothly they preemptively scheduled several backup options and trained their teams extensively . In order not disrupt ongoing scientific operations they had carefully planned how long it would take for each step , starting on September sixth ,with a new strategy called simultaneous operation where multiple teams worked independently but closely together across different areas like moving parts or upgrading systems . This innovative approach allowed them achieve significant progress within just two months despite complex technical challenges like coordinating four separate telescope installations concurrently .
