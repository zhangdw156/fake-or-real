The GASP (GAs Stripping Phenomena) project uses data from ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT) instrument called MUSE to analyze how gases are removed from distant spiral arms across various environments like clusters or isolated regions around other objects like black holes . They aim at understanding this process by examining about half a dozen hundred spiral arms across different types including those actively forming new stars compared with inactive ones . This includes looking at:
How often these events occur;
The mass of both individual spiral arms AND their surrounding structures; and how they move relative to each other near these massive objects;
This project also explores how removing such gases might affect future generations within these spirals by studying their evolution over time through both observational evidence collected by telescopes like VLTMUSE along with theoretical models developed by astronomers . This helps us better understand why some spirals have stopped forming new stars while others continue doing so effectively even if they seem inactive on first glance .
