The second-generation Variable Light Telescope (VLT) Secondary Mirror Unit has been shipped to the European Southern Observatory (ESO). This unit has been fully tested and approved in a standalone mode and passed its technical acceptance in Europe. It is currently being installed on ASSIST, ESO's test bench for adaptive optics, where further optical tests will be conducted before its final acceptance in Europe. 
 
 The deformable secondary mirror, with its 1,170 actuators and 1.1-meter thin-shell mirror, is the largest adaptive optics mirror ever produced. This achievement is a significant accomplishment for European industry and will serve as the flagship of the Adaptive Optics Facility (AOF) at Paranal Observatory.

 The Adaptive Optics Facility aims to transform the Very Large Telescope's Unit Telescope 4 (UT4) into an adaptive telescope by replacing the conventional secondary mirror with an adaptive one, using the Four Laser Guide Star Facility (4LGSF), and installing adaptive optics (AO) modules on the various foci. Recent developments include the launch of the Enhanced Resolution Imager and Spectrograph (ERIS) project, which will be installed on the Cassegrain focus of UT4 with an upgraded SPIFFI near-infrared imaging spectrograph. This installation, alongside the 4LGSF and the deformable secondary mirror, will optimize all instruments on UT4 for use with this technology. Significant progress has been made since the last report in The Messenger as most system components have been delivered to ESO Garching and integrated.
