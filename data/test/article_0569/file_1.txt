DSM testing began several years ago at a subsystem level. In May 2011, an Integration Progress Review took place. This included inspecting all hardware produced by this time before integrating the entire DSM system at ADS and Microgate facilities. The goal was to ensure validation of all components before this final step. Both contractors developed custom tools and test setups for this phase. At Microgate (where electronic and software development occurred), corresponding subsystems were inspected and tested, including electronic control boards, actuators, racks, and software. A significant amount of data was gathered from these tests, reviewed by ESO, and will be integrated into the system as internal calibration data used during operation. Mechanical subsystems were also tested at ADS. Hexapod motion characteristics were assessed for centering, focusing, focal station changes (Nasmyth to Cassegrain), full range, accuracy, and cross-coupling. Specific attention was given to mechanical rigidity of the system.
