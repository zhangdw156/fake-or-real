Back in the day, we were testing the DSM like it's the ultimate Minecraft server – just for us (wink). Back in 2011, that meant a whole week at ADS and Microgate to make sure all the hardware was ship-shape before integrating the whole system. It was about validating those components before the big reveal.  Both contractors built custom tools and testing setups.  Microgate, where they worked on the electronics & software side of things, checked out their own specific subsystems – from control boards and actuators to racks and the software itself. A ton of data was collected (a lot of it!), reviewed by ESO, and will be used as calibration data for the system. Meanwhile, in ADS’s workshop, we put the mechanical parts through their paces: the hexapod motion was tested on everything from centering and focusing to changing focal points (Nasmyth to Cassegrain). We even put its accuracy, its range of movement, and its stability under a magnifying glass – basically making sure that machine could handle anything.
