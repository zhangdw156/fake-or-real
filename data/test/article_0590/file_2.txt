Forget those fantastical portals! ESA is about to launch a rocket ship, fueled by cutting-edge technology, in a race against the arcane mages.

Here's the lowdown on how the VISTA Public Surveys (PS) are being organized:  Just like wizards strategizing their spells, ESA wants to finish the surveys within five years. But we're not just casting spells in a void - we're considering real-world constraints based on what worked before. 

The PS time table is based on the principal investigators' desires (think of them as the master spellcasters) and their observations from past semesters.  Figure 1 lays out the schedule, showing how the time for each survey is spread out like a carefully planned celestial alignment. 

The magic behind this timetable is this: all the VISTA PS surveys have top priority - just like a brilliant sorcerer's ultimate spells! To accommodate this, regular programs (which still deserve respect) are being juggled alongside public surveys, much like managing multiple dimensions.  But starting from P88, normal program observations will be treated equally - no carryover magic, just pure execution! 

To ensure smooth sailing with the PS survey ships and prevent interference, an important policy was implemented: proposals for open time (like impromptu spells) can access specific right ascension ranges, but they need to justify their scientific goals clearly. Because these goals should be achievable through a properly-planned public survey, or face rejection, like magic that doesn't work properly.
