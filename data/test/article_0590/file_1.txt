VISTA Public Surveys (PS) scheduling follows a recommendation to finish surveys within five years. The time allocated for surveying is based on realistic expectations of what can be accomplished within the next semester, considering experience from past VISTA operations.  The allocation is determined by the principal investigator's updated observing request and accounts for carry-over time from previous periods. Figure 1 shows a breakdown of how the survey timeline has been adjusted for the six PSs over various time frames. The implementation of the PSP recommendation requires adjustments to the standard VLT scheduling system because public surveys have top priority for execution. Alongside these, normal program observations were also scheduled alongside public surveys and Chilean programs from P87.  Normal programs had high priority similar to the public surveys and were prioritized as they cover all observing conditions. Since P88, carry-over time was eliminated for normal programs to avoid interfering with survey progress. To minimize open programs' impact on PS progress: proposals can use restricted right ascension ranges since P89; however, justification is necessary highlighting why these goals cannot be achieved through the scheduled PS.
