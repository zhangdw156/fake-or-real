Images of the targets were obtained using two observation blocks, concatenated in time order. The first block focused on K-band, J-band, and Z-band imaging with exposure times varying from 96 to 300 seconds per pixel, depending on the target tile. For these images, a two-jittering strategy was used for each pawprint position except for the Z band. The second block primarily covered H-band, Y-band, and Z-band imaging with significantly shorter exposure times (ranging from 96 to 48 seconds per pixel). Short exposures were used for Y and Z bands to avoid saturation of images for bright objects. The entire observation block took approximately two hours because young and low-mass stars can vary in brightness over several hours or days. As a result, simultaneous observations across multiple VISTA broadband filters can provide accurate data on the object's spectral energy distribution.  
For regions where a clear background was present (mostly for the Orion Survey area), the sky was determined by analyzing the science images. However, one tile contained NGC 2024, which displayed nebulosity. To address this, a specific strategy was adopted: using a combined image of that tile's observations with an offset sky field taken on the east side of NGC 2024 and with additional observations from the north side of the tile. In addition, shallow repeated imaging of another tile was performed to search for variability in sources in the region centered around the stellar group known as 25 Ori.  For this tile, specific observation blocks were executed for J- and H-band at least once per night with a minimal time separation of one hour between the two images taken. To increase sensitivity in observing Z and J band of another tile, which includes the well-studied cluster sigma Ori, additional observation blocks at these bands were prepared. These observations acted as fillers for the nights when they weren't feasible to start deep imaging on new tiles due to time constraints. The observation settings for those images were NDIT multiplied by DIT equal to 3 times 30 seconds (Z) and 8 multiplied by 4 seconds (J), with three jitters per pawprint position.
