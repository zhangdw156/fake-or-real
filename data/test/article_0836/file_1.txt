Recent experiments have increased the estimated amount of baryonic matter in the Universe, which has resulted in updated amounts of deuterium, helium, and lithium formed during Big Bang nucleosynthesis. This new data shows that more lithium was produced than previously believed, leading to a concerning discrepancy of about two times or more compared to the commonly measured abundance in stars on the Spite plateau. Now, taking atomic diffusion into account, the amounts of lithium found in stars align well with the primordial lithium levels. We also observe the effects of atomic diffusion in lithium levels in turnoff and SGB stars, where a specific rise observed in SGB stars supports the diffusion model. This research makes the Spite plateau even more intriguing, as it has a cosmological origin but is uniformly decreased by physical processes in stars. This theoretical idea has existed for decades but did not gain traction among observers until recent diffusion models made this uniform decrease seem plausible, while also helping to constrain primordial lithium levels. Atomic diffusion might resolve the issue of lithium abundance in cosmology, but we note that other factors may also be important. This work emphasizes three methodological points: the potential of new multi-object spectrometers at large telescopes, the value of a consistent analysis of all relevant factors, and the advantages of refining physical models for greater self-consistency. The finding that atomic diffusion influences the chemical abundances in old, unevolved stars and that models can accommodate its effects is important and has several implications. Currently, turbulent mixing is included in an ad-hoc way without explaining its underlying physics. Similarly, we overlook the spectral impacts of thermal inhomogeneities and the three-dimensional nature of convection in our standard one-dimensional analysis. Therefore, much work remains to be done before the quality of current observational data aligns with the physical models of stars, allowing us to fully interpret the chemical element signatures in stellar spectra.
