The decision to host this school at La Silla raises questions about its purpose given that it targets non-European students primarily while regular NEON Schools cater to Europeans better suited for them already (except those pursuing PhDs). Despite this focus on international participants specifically coming from outside Europe , there's high demand that necessitates efficient utilization of available resources like La Silla's telescopes which are open access based on scientific merit alone . This event serves two key purposes: training highly skilled astronomers engineers vital for Chilean observatory operations while strengthening ties between Europe local communities through potential job opportunities downline . Its success has spurred plans for similar events in line with past successes like an earlier joint initiative organized between ESO Centre national de la recherche scientifique back in 1988 .
