ESO successfully overcame early challenges related to combining light from multiple telescopes at Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTi). Now they face two key steps: improving sensitivity precision via phased alignment; then exploring how best use those improvements for high resolution spectroscopy studying celestial objects' properties across different wavelengthsfrequencies – like infrared light – leading towards more detailed observations than ever before . The team plans on tackling these challenges one at time starting by focusing on phased alignment then later incorporating additional technologies like wavefront correction into both arrays - UT AT - ensuring optimal performance throughout all stages . They are actively developing tools like "GRAVITY" project specifically designed around achieving precise astronomical measurements using MATISSE's unique capabilities , which promises groundbreaking discoveries . Lastly , they aim at making observations much easier for everyone involved through improved software tools , training programs ,and streamlined procedures aimed toward maximizing accessibility while minimizing technical hurdles faced by users . This effort could lead towards greater collaboration between scientists worldwide who can contribute their unique knowledge contributing further advancements within astronomy .
