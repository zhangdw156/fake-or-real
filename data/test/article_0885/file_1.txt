The E-ELT will include two Nasmyth foci and one Coudé focus, regardless of its design. Given that some of the proposed instruments are large and complex, there will be a gravity-stabilized focus at the Nasmyth position. This is achieved by using a flat mirror that directs the beam downwards to set up an instrument that can rotate around a vertical axis while maintaining a consistent angle to gravity. To facilitate this, the telescope must be able to subtly change its focal length. The VLT complicatively allows this adjustment, switching from the true Ritchey-Chrétien f/15 focus at Nasmyth to the Cassegrain f/13.6 without needing a secondary mirror replacement, achieved instead by adjusting the primary's conic constant via active optics actuators and refocusing. For the E-ELT, both the Gregorian and five-mirror designs can support such a focal length adjustment. The Gregorian design requires sound architectural support for its specific instruments; therefore, rollers from the ESE instrumentation working group allowed both available locations to manage instruments over 20 tons and measuring up to 16 m on a side, with multiple placements on the platform as needed.
