The E-ELT will include two Nasmyth foci and one Coudé focus, regardless of its design. Since some of the intended instruments will be large and complex, a gravity-stable focus will be created at the Nasmyth locations. By using a flat mirror to direct the beam downward, an instrument can be placed where it can rotate around the vertical axis while keeping a constant angle to gravity. This requires the telescope to adjust its focal length slightly. Such adjustments are routinely made at the VLT, where the switch from the true Ritchey-Chrétien f/15 focus at Nasmyth to the Cassegrain f/13.6 occurs without changing the secondary mirror by altering the primary's conic constant (via active optics actuators) and refocusing the telescope. Both the Gregorian and five-mirror designs for the E-ELT can accommodate this focal length adjustment. The Gregorian design necessitates a sufficiently large Nasmyth platform to host these massive instruments. The ESE instrumentation working group's recommendations have been considered, allowing for instruments weighing over 20 tons and measuring up to 16 meters on a side to be accommodated at the focus, with more than one able to be present on the platform simultaneously.
