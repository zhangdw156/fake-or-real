The GRAVITY instrument uses adaptive optics technology called CIAO to improve its ability to see faint distant stars by correcting for distortions caused by Earth's atmosphere during observations made through its four large telescopes ("Unit Telescopes").
By combining light from different celestial objects using fiber optic cables connected via specialized devices called "beam combiners," GRAVITY can measure minute shifts caused by changing atmospheric conditions even while observing over extended periods without blurring images or losing detail due to turbulence or other disturbances affecting visibility .
This precision measurement capability enables scientists around world access detailed information about these astronomical phenomena through various modes including both single field where only one target is measured simultaneously or dual field where multiple targets can be observed simultaneously allowing them observe both close proximity stars that appear brighter than fainter ones that might otherwise be difficult if not impossible to detect . This technique also allows researchers who use this powerful tool access precise measurements like distances between stars within their own galaxies .
