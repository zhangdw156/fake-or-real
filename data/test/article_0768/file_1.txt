The magnetic chemically peculiar stars known as Ap and Bp stars (spectral classes A and B) are currently the most extensively researched stars regarding their magnetic field strength and geometry. Unlike solar-like stars, their magnetic fields consist of large spatial scales and do not change much over the course of a year. Simulations using three-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics have confirmed the presence of stable magneto-hydrodynamic structures that likely explain the long-lasting, organized magnetic fields found in these stars. In our initial survey of over 150 Ap and Bp stars, including rapidly oscillating Ap stars, we confirmed that low-resolution spectropolarimetry of hydrogen Balmer lines taken with FORS1 is an effective method for detecting stellar magnetic fields. We identified magnetic fields in 63 Ap and Bp stars during this survey. Some of these stars were included in a reevaluation of the evolutionary status of upper main-sequence magnetic stars, utilizing precise Hipparcos parallaxes. Our new findings support the earlier observation that magnetic stars with masses below 3 solar masses tend to be located toward the center of the main-sequence band, while those with masses above 3 solar masses appear closer to the zero-age main-sequence. In this study, we also found an extraordinary magnetic Ap star, HD 154708, which has the strongest longitudinal magnetic field recorded in a rapidly oscillating Ap star, with an average magnetic field strength of approximately 24.5 ± 1.0 kG. This field is about three times stronger than that of HD 166473, which has a magnetic field strength of around 5.5 to 9.0 kG, making it the second strongest roAp star. Recent measurements of HD 154708 taken with FORS1 over three months in 2008 allowed us to determine its rotation period to be 5.367 ± 0.020 days. HD 154708 is the first star studied with FORS1 that has a sufficiently uniform phase coverage to establish its magnetic period. It is important to note that the size of the error bars is similar to the size of the dots representing the individual measurements. The measurement with the highest error (6.326 ± 0.059 kG) was taken under "thick clouds," which caused frequent loss of the guide star; this measurement was repeated by an observer a few nights later.
