To understand the properties of the detected clusters and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the XXL survey is accompanied by detailed follow-up observations from various instruments across different wavelengths: X-ray, radio, etc. These coordinated observations, particularly those involving the ESO Large Programme, are crucial as they help measure galaxy redshifts to accurately locate these clusters in three dimensions.  Observations with the NTT, EFOSC2, and FORS2 on the VLT provided data for clusters at redshift up to 0.5, while those at higher redshift (0.5 < z < 1.2) were captured using the FORS2 instrument on the VLT. The detection of a cluster with a redshift of ~ 1.9 is an example of this process. Cluster redshifts are vital inputs for cosmological analyses, enabling the computation of the cluster-cluster correlation function and further studies into the clusters' topology.  Observations at the William Herschel Telescope (WHT) allow investigation of the individual clusters’ dynamics and galaxy properties, while the AAOmega instrument on the Australian Astronomical Telescope is used to systematically measure the redshift of the AGN. Radio follow-up of X-ray AGNs was conducted using the GMRT, VLA, and ATCA.  Numerical simulation programmes are also used to test various physical mechanisms that drive cluster and AGN evolution and their interactions. These simulations help accurately determine the cluster selection function, another important component for cosmological analysis. A total of 13 articles were published in December 2015’s Astronomy & Astrophysics special issue on the XXL survey's catalogue of brightest clusters (XXL-100-GC) and AGNs (XXL-1000-AGN). These catalogues also include the reduced XMM observations. The study further focuses on providing a detailed characterization of the low-mass range within the XXL cluster sample.
