X-ray and polarized infrared emissions from flares provide a deeper understanding of the processes that reveal key characteristics in the sub-mm range. Recent measurements of near-infrared (NIR) polarization show that the emission from SgrA* is highly polarized during flares. It features a main flare with little to no polarization, along with highly polarized sub-flares. These are the first polarimetric observations in the NIR of a source operating in a strong gravitational field, making them significant for testing general relativity models for accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In several instances, the flare activity indicates a quasi-periodicity of about 20 minutes. By analyzing both the variations in the light curve and the changing polarization angle simultaneously, we demonstrate that the data can be effectively modeled using a straightforward relativistic hot spot or ring model. According to this model, the broad NIR flares (lasting roughly 100 minutes) of SgrA* result from a sound wave traveling around the SMBH once. The sub-flares, which occur on top of the broad flare, are thought to arise from the emission of Doppler-boosted spots, likely caused by temporarily heated and accelerated electrons in a plasma component. Recent studies of infrared light curves indicate that significant contributions from a red noise process (larger amplitudes at lower frequencies) are also probable. If there is an extended disc structure, this contribution can be modeled with multiple components that follow power spectrum distributions. The spots would likely be the brightest contributors to the total flux density, and there are ongoing discussions about scenarios in which spiral wave structures influence the observed variability.
