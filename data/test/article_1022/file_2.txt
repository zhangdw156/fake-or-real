X-ray and polarised infrared emissions from flares provide a deeper understanding of the processes that display key characteristics in the sub-mm range. Recent near-infrared (NIR) polarisation measurements indicate that the emissions from SgrA* are notably polarised during flares. This consists of a mainly non-polarised or weakly polarised primary flare with highly polarised secondary flares. These observations are the first NIR polarimetric data from a source strongly influenced by gravity, making them crucial for testing general relativity models for accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In several instances, the flare activity appears to have a period of about 20 minutes. By fitting the fluctuations in the light curve and the changing polarisation angle at the same time, we establish that the data align well with a straightforward relativistic hot spot or ring model. In this model, SgrA*'s broad NIR flares (lasting roughly 100 minutes) arise from a sound wave that travels around the SMBH once. The smaller sub-flares overlap with the broad flare and are caused by the intensified emission from spots thought to result from heated and accelerated electrons in a plasma component. Latest studies of infrared light curves suggest that there may be substantial contributions from a red noise process, meaning larger amplitudes at lower frequencies. With an extended disc structure, such contributions could also be modelled as multiple components that conform to power spectrum distributions. The spots would then serve as the main contributors to the overall flux density. Discussions are also ongoing regarding scenarios in which spiral wave structures may explain the observed variability.
