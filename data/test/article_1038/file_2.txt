The upcoming analysis of the SNLS third year dataset will give the most accurate measurement yet of the dark energy causing the accelerated expansion of the universe. While these cosmological findings will attract significant attention, SNLS has also provided new insights into the astrophysics of SN Ia progenitors and their explosions. So far, no discoveries have contradicted the conclusions drawn from using SNe Ia in cosmology, but some questions persist. For instance, why are the brightest SNe Ia linked to shorter delay times and the youngest galaxies? How well do SNe Ia from various environments compare in a cosmological analysis? A compelling possibility is that there may be more than one progenitor mechanism. Making progress depends on identifying key environmental differences between delayed and prompt events. For example, metallicity is expected to influence SN Ia brightness and rates. Recent observations suggest these effects but need confirmation through detailed spectroscopy of the host galaxies from larger, complete, and consistent samples like SNLS. This effort will soon start using the VLT. Like any experiment, the accuracy of SNLS results is influenced by both statistical and systematic uncertainties. As more SNe Ia are included in the analysis and statistical errors decrease, systematic errors become more significant. Ultimately, controlling systematics in SN cosmology presents two main challenges. The first involves photometric calibration. The SNLS calibration is accurate to about 0.01â€“0.015 magnitudes; future experiments will need a calibration of better than 1% for both distant and nearby samples, requiring as much effort for the local sample as for the higher-redshift SNLS dataset. The second challenge is understanding SN Ia limitations by examining their astrophysical properties and managing any subtle evolutionary effects. SNLS is providing the crucial foundation for both of these efforts.
