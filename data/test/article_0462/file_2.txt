Chajnantor, a celestial high-altitude stage, plays host to unique astronomical symphonies. The air is both thin and dry, as if played on a violin tuned to a sub-mm note, where instruments like the Swedish Heterodyne Facility Instrument (SHFI) of the MPIfR  ("like an opera conductor's baton") lead the orchestra. The First Light APEX Sub-millimetre Heterodyne instrument (FLASH), a "guitar virtuoso," adds its own flair to the performance, offering routine observations in atmospheric windows previously reserved for a solo violinist. 

The LABOCA array, like the bassline of a symphony, offers continuum observations with its massive 870-μm bolometer arrays. A new addition, SABOCA ("a pianist adding a touch of finesse"), with its camera, opens up another shorter wavelength atmospheric window – "like shifting from an acoustic concert to a jazz session."  A larger stage: With a field of view as large as 1.5 arcminutes, SABOCA maps the sub-mm ranges like a skilled conductor guiding a grand orchestra. Its counterpart, SHARC-II at Caltech, shines in the same band with remarkable accuracy. It can "probe" warmer dust emission or even constrain dust temperatures and emissivity index, "like an astrophysicist deciphering a musical score." 

Finally, SABOCA's 7.8-arcsecond beam size provides three times better spatial resolution than Herschel/SPIRE at similar wavelengths. This heightened clarity translates to more precise size estimates and positions of sub-mm sources, aiding the identification of counterparts at other wavelengths – "like a composer finding hidden themes in a song."  The addition of SABOCA to APEX's diverse range marks the instrument's dedication to serving as an early pathfinder for ALMA. Like a pianist adding notes to an already rich composition, it now unlocks the very highest frequency band of ALMA, opening new avenues for astronomical exploration.
