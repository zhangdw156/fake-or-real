Chajnantor's high altitude and dry atmosphere make it ideal for sub-millimeter astronomy. The APEX observatory already utilizes several highly sensitive instruments: the Swedish Heterodyne Facility Instrument (SHFI), the Carbon Heterodyne Array of the MPIfR (CHAMP+), and the First Light APEX Sub-millimetre Heterodyne instrument (FLASH). These instruments allow for observations in specific parts of the spectrum that are rarely available from other locations. The observatory's LABOCA array also observes at 870-μm, while SABOCA operates in a shorter wavelength range of 350-μm and complements LABOCA. This new camera provides mapping capabilities within the sub-mm range, enabling observations to probe warm dust emission or constrain dust temperatures and emissivity index.  With its enhanced resolution at 350-μm, SABOCA can further improve our understanding of these objects.
