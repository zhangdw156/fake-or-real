To understand how hydrogen gas moves in the center of Cen A, we build a kinematic model. This model assumes that the gas only moves around in a thin disk under gravity from nearby stars and a black hole expected to be present at the center. We get this stellar potential using data from NACO, NICMOS, and 2MASS telescopes. Using spherical symmetry and combining this information with an estimate of how much mass is there compared to light we can determine the gas's three-dimensional position. The stellar velocity contributes to our overall model based on dynamics.  Since the observed hydrogen gas velocities at the center are significantly faster than the average rotation speed, it needs to be accounted for in our model. We simulate this kinematics using a tilted-ring model. This means the inclination angle and position angle of the gas disk are dependent on distance. The orbits remain circular but neighboring gas orbits might not lie in the same plane.  We find that gas disk geometry shifts from being coplanar to warped, creating variations depending on location within Cen A. By using multiple models with varying disc inclination and black hole mass, we find a model that matches the observed data best. The best-fitting black hole mass for this tilted-ring model is for a median disc inclination of 34 degrees Â± 4 degrees (error bars at the 3 sigma level).
