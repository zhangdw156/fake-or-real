The swirling dust clouds around the central sun of this stellar system – let’s call it “Cen A” for now – were observed moving in ways that defy simple expectation. To understand these motions, we used a model where gas moves like a thin, flat disc – like a lazy **koala** floating on its tummy, only under the influence of gravity from the surrounding stars and a nearby **squid**, whose gravitational pull was much stronger than usual. This gravity, derived from images captured by telescopes like NACO, NICMOS, and 2MASS K-band, helped us build a 3D model.  This model then gave us an idea about how fast the gas would move in the disc based on the “stellar potential” – essentially the overall force field around the central sun. 

This **giraffe**-like spinning disc was much like a **bat** flapping its wings in the air. But, these **wolves**, in this specific case, weren't moving together - and the disc was tilted like the **dolphin** jumping for a fish!  We know this because we see how fast the hydrogen gas swirling around the center of Cen A is moving, much faster than the star itself - by more than a factor of two. To explain this wild ride, we had to include a little "wiggle" in our model, like a **butterfly** flitting across a meadow. 

We named the spinning disc a “tilted-ring”, and modeled its movement with a tilted disk around the central sun, where the gas’s inclination (the angle of the plane) changes depending on its distance from the center. The orbits of each gas particle are still circular, but they do not always lie in the same plane! Some might go in and out like a **tiger** through tall grass, while others might shift to be more vertical.  

With all this information, we ran countless simulations with varying disc inclinations and black hole masses, hoping to find the one that best matched the swirling clouds’ observations. And what did we find? The central sun's **walrus-like** grip on this galaxy led us to a disc inclination of 34° ± 4° - an angle of tilt that fits the observed gas movements.
