Luminous Star: Luminous Star L2Pup
The second closest aging giant star after R Doradus was studied by astronomers who discovered it dims significantly over time
Using advanced techniques like "lucky imaging", they captured detailed pictures across different wavelengths revealing surprising features about its surroundings
The data showed that it has two distinct components but when observing it through infrared light reveals one large component instead
This led them to propose that there's likely an equatorial disk made up from dusty material surrounding L2Pup which explains why it changes shape depending on how much light reaches different parts
