The isotopic shift of the 670.8 nm emission line of 6Li compared to 7Li is just 0.016 nm. This is similar to the width of the lithium line created by fine structure splitting and turbulence in the stellar atmosphere. Additionally, the 6Li/7Li ratio is limited to a maximum of 10%. Therefore, the presence of 6Li appears as a slight asymmetry in the 670.8 nm line. As a result, detecting 6Li requires both very high spectral resolution and a good signal-to-noise ratio. With 4-meter telescopes, studies have only been able to examine a few relatively bright stars (V < 9 mag), such as HD 84937. However, starting in 1999, the VLT and its high-resolution spectrograph UVES made it possible to systematically search for 6Li in fainter, metal-poor stars. The spectra used in this study were collected in July 2000, February 2002, and August 2004. To achieve the highest spectral resolution (l/Dl = 120,000), an image slicer was used to convert the star's seeing disc into a narrow rectangular image that fits the UVES spectrographâ€™s slits (0.3 arcsec). The image slicer increases observation efficiency and also helps to widen the spectrum, reducing issues with achieving a smooth fluorescent background for the spectra. Detailed methods for observations and data reduction are found in the literature. The recorded spectra range from 600 to 820 nm, except for the August 2004 observations, which focused on the very metal-poor star LP815-43 with a different UVES setting for the quick dispersion in the 500 to 700 nm area, in order to validate an initial 6Li detection suggested by the earlier July 2000 spectrum.
