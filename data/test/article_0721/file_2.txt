The isotopic shift of the 670.8 nm resonance line of 6Li compared to the corresponding line of 7Li is only 0.016 nm. This shift is similar to the width of the lithium line caused by fine structure splitting and broadening due to turbulence in the star's atmosphere. Additionally, the ratio of 6Li to 7Li does not exceed 10%. Therefore, 6Li is indicated by a slight extra asymmetry in the 670.8 nm line. As a result, detecting 6Li requires very high spectral resolution and a strong signal-to-noise ratio. Using 4-meter-class telescopes, only a few relatively bright stars (V < 9 mag), like HD 84937, could be studied, but starting in 1999, the VLT and its high-resolution spectrograph UVES allowed for a systematic search for 6Li in fainter, more metal-poor stars. The spectra used in this study were taken in July 2000, February 2002, and August 2004. To achieve the highest spectral resolution (l/Dl = 120,000), an image slicer was used to change the star's seeing disc into a rectangular image that fits the narrow (0.3 arcsec) entrance slit of the UVES spectrograph. This image slicer not only enhanced the efficiency of the observations but also helped to widen the spectrum, minimizing flatfielding issues for a smooth continuum. A detailed explanation of the observations and data reduction is available in the literature. The spectra cover the range from 600 to 820 nm, except for the August 2004 observations when the very metal-poor star LP815-43 was observed again using a different UVES setting for the 500 to 700 nm range to test a potential detection of 6Li based on the July 2000 spectrum.
