Dinosaur Rex
The dinosaur hunt proved challenging as there wasn't enough information about how things should operate after dinosaur fossils are found at different locations around Dinosaur Island . The experts also didn't seem interested in helping out afterwards so communication became strained between all parties involved .
To keep things running smoothly going forward , all parties need better communication , clearer expectations about future research , increased collaboration between scientists at both sites (and possibly even dinosaur paleontologists), along with a dedicated fossil expert who could assist with learning about new discoveries made elsewhere .
