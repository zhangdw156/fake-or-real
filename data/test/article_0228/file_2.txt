The project faces challenges related both with the duration required after installation for proper functioning alongside technical issues surrounding data processing ("pipelines").
While initial installations are completed successfully there remains ongoing need for support due to insufficient training programs during transition phases which hinders smooth operation at PArnal observatory site .
Additionally , despite initial focus being put towards equipment delivery , there's lack clarity regarding "after-sales" commitments leading to difficulties between ESO (European Southern Observatory) expectations Consortium deliverables during operational phase .
In order improve collaboration between ESO Consortia , suggestions include :
Enhanced Early Involvement: Including scientific personnel from both Garching (ESO headquarters) PArnal observatory site throughout all stages including design phase will lead better coordination smoother transitions .
Clarified After Sales Period: Establishing clearer agreements regarding post-installation support will reduce potential conflicts arising due unclear responsibilities between parties involved..
Dedicated Support Personnel: Sending technical experts from Consortia teams directly stationed at PArnal could facilitate knowledge transfer skill sharing leading towards improved long term performance .
