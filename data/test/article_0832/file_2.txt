The contract to build ALMA was signed in 2002 by the North American community, represented by the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the European community, represented by ESO. After three years of design studies and prototype research, it became clear that the project could not be completed on time or within the original budget set at the signing. Consequently, the ALMA management and scientists were tasked with creating a new project plan that fit within the available budget while still achieving the main scientific goals. During this time, extensive studies and efforts were made to outline the revised ALMA project. A significant cost-cutting measure was reducing the number of antennas from sixty-four to fifty, with an eventual aim of reaching sixty-four again. Tests for the receiver cartridge indicated that several receivers exceeded their noise temperature requirements, which helped to alleviate the impact on sensitivity from having fewer antennas. Independent advisory committees confirmed the scientific value of the modified ALMA project with its new, lower costs. By the end of 2005, the revised project plan and budget were endorsed by the ESO Council. The North American partners received approval from the NSF by mid-2006. Meanwhile, Japan, represented by the National Astronomy Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), worked on finalizing its involvement in ALMA. The European and North American partners collaborated closely with their Japanese counterparts to clarify Japan's role and reviewed several subsystems, including correlators, receivers, and antennas. The terms of the partnerships were established, leading to a trilateral agreement signed in summer 2006 between ESO, NSF, and Japan's National Institute for Natural Sciences (NINS). NAOJ will supply four twelve-meter antennas, twelve seven-meter antennas, two receiver bands for all sixty-six ALMA antennas, and the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) Correlator. Funding approval for Japanâ€™s participation was also necessary. With Japan's involvement, ALMA became a truly global astronomy facility.
