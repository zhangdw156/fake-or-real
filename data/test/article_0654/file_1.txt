To better understand the properties of cold molecular gas, observations of its high J CO emission (up to J = 7) were made using two instruments: the Institut de Radioastronomie Millim√©trique Plateau de Bure Interferometer (IRAM PdBI) and the APEX Swedish Heterodyne Facility Instrument (SHFI). Data was collected for CO(1 minus 0) and CO(7 minus 6) lines using IRAM Eight Mixer Receiver (EMIR) and APEX/SHFI, respectively. All of the CO spectra showed multiple peaks that were separated into a "red" component and a "blue" component by 300 km/s or so.  The ratio of high to low-J emission reflects the excitation level of the molecular gas. To model this excitation level, line energy distributions (SLED) were created for both the "red" and "blue" components using large velocity gradient (LVG) models. Both components fit best with two temperature models, about 40 K and density about 10 to the power of 3 and 10 to the power of 4 cm minus 3, respectively. The LVG model also accounts for the size of the CO-emitting region as a free parameter, allowing estimates for each component's size.  Finally, the SLED modeling suggests both "red" and "blue" components have a compact core with a radius about 150 pc surrounded by a larger, diffuse region with a radius about 500 pc. While these sizes come with some uncertainty, the brightest CO-emitting regions appear similar to those seen locally in starburst galaxies; they have a dense, active star-forming center surrounded by a diffuse gas disk.
