The KMOS telescope began taking scientific observations on November 21, 2012. After a partly cloudy start, the instrument's dome opened at 9:30 PM and initial target acquisition was achieved. The process involved pointing the telescope at bright stars and taking short exposures using one arm at a time, centered within the field of view.  Each star was accurately captured in the IFU (Integral Field Unit) with a width of 2.8 by 2.8 arcseconds. This simple observation required complex coordination from numerous systems, including real-time display that shows target objects' positions in reconstructed datacubes. The initial acquisition sequence is crucial to KMOS and allows for precise telescope adjustment by targeting bright stars and then centering them automatically using a shift and rotation of the field of view. Once aligned, the arms can be repositioned for other science targets. One key challenge was achieving accurate arm placement, requiring solutions involving plate scale calibration, variations in focal plane measurements, and correction lookup tables to compensate for individual arm movement. These latter adjustments proved particularly difficult and required an astrometric calibration procedure using star fields found in open or globular clusters. The final calibration wasn't completed until the commissioning phase two, however, it now demonstrates a 1Ïƒ positional accuracy of 0.1 arcseconds. The rest of the initial commissioning run focused on testing all KMOS modes, including its ability to create large mosaic patterns covering up to 60 by 40 arcseconds across the sky. It also collected calibration and performance data for verification tests.
