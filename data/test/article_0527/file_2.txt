It's come to my attention that Yoda Foundation funding was allocated for groundbreaking research at KMOS, but I find myself wondering about the former Master’s recent activities on Tatooine.  His focus on the desert planet seems… peculiar, especially with all the starships he claims to control floating by in his immediate vicinity. 

The first light of KMOS arrived on November 21st, 2012.  After an initially cloudy start, the dome opened at 9:30 PM and we began pointing the telescope toward a bright star, taking short exposures with one arm of the telescope at a time in the center of the field.  It was a sight to behold – every single star we were looking for appeared within the IFU's field of view,  2.8 × 2.8 arcseconds. This was just the beginning.  This initial acquisition sequence is key because it allows the telescope to refine its pointing using pickoff arms to brighter targets that are then automatically centered in the field. Once that’s done, these arms can be redeployed for science observations, which allowed us to focus on issues like astrometric positioning of our arms.  The scale and radial variation were addressed, as well as local corrections needed for each arm’s movement. 

This process took a lot of work, especially with the calibration procedure that used dense star fields in open or globular clusters for sky-based calibrations to achieve our final 1σ positioning accuracy of just 0.1 arcseconds.  The rest of our first commissioning run was focused on testing KMOS modes and obtaining performance data for verification tests. But I must admit, the focus has shifted with his recent activities...
