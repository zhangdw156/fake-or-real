Observations using Orion telescope's KL instrument took place on October thirteenthth , spanning nearly three hours across various frequencies within submillimeter wavelengths . Although weather conditions weren't ideal due mainly to precipitation(PWV), they allowed detection of bright features within our target object . Six different configurations covering frequencies between five hundred eighty one gigahertz (GHz) and five hundred ninety five GHZ were employed; each configuration had four gigahertz bandwidth dedicated solely towards its respective signal or image band while overlapping with its subsequent counterpart by two gigahertz . A similar strategy was applied across higher frequencies ranging up t o seven hundred thirteen GHZ , ensuring complete coverage across both low high frequency ranges(five hundred eighty one - six hundred seven GHZ seven hundred one - seven two seven GHZ respectively). Each tuning lasted sixty seconds thereby guaranteeing double coverage per spectrum dueto overlapping frequencies between adjacent tunings . Atmospheric emission mitigation involved utilizing wobbling secondary motion at a rate consistent with one point five Hertz per second.. To minimize potential contamination arising from off position alignment , an azimuthal amplitude control system enabled adjustments fifteen degrees arcseconds while operating under symmetric mode . As CO line presence wasnt detected within either signal or image bands , this minimized chances for interference issues when identifying other spectral features.. Initial data processing involved applying single opacity corrections via APEXs calibrator software based on segments spanning twenty point five Gigahertz sections; this proved insufficient as it didnt adequately address atmospheric variations affecting individual channels requiring recalibration through offline manipulation specifically tailored towards individual channels corresponding roughly equalizing zero point eight millihertz bandwidths.. Recalibration via this method proved particularly effective around specific molecular oxygen peaks as well as several prominent ozone peaks; however it failed completely eliminate any residual atmospheric ozone signals measured near fifty eight two point one four Ghz due primarily attributable limitations associated with transmission levels throughout lower end range within low frequency window... To avoid aliasing effects arising during spectrum production process starting points included removing outermost fifty millihertz edge regions along with another one hundred millihertz section overlapping region before generating final spectra ; these modifications resulted into resampling original resolution down toward half kilometer per second signifying approximately equivalenting one megahertz bandwidth capability
