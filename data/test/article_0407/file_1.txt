Alright, so we're looking at a big ol' stellar beast here – 1.68 solar masses and negative 0.09 dex metallicity makes it a real heavy-hitter, you know? This cosmic heavyweight is also got a long cool-down period of 344 days! And guess what? We found a planet with a range from 3.71 to 6.04 solar masses. Time to zoom in on the data! We dug deep into FEROS and HARPS,  with 42 radial velocities and six more observations for good measure, but nothing stood out like a clear-cut signal. So we went back to our old routine, trying the same parameters from before – that 455 day period, minimum mass of 2.1 solar masses, with an eccentricity of 0.6.  But hey, even though we got a relatively smooth fit and those errors were down to 29.3 meters per second, there's this nagging feeling about the potential companion. It's just too faint, you know? Maybe one day with more data we'll be able to tell if these space-dwelling pals really exist! For now, it's a wild mystery,  a cosmic whisper in the vastness of space!
