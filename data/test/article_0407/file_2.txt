This star is extremely heavy, with a mass equivalent to 1.68 times the mass of our sun, and has very little material compared to the average star. A planet was previously discovered in orbit around this star, but it's possible the planet doesn't exist based on observations taken from different telescopes (FEROS and HARPS). The analysis of the data indicates a likely orbital period for the planet of 455 days, minimum mass of 2.1 solar masses, and an eccentricity of 0.6, though the existence of this planet is still uncertain.  The uncertainty remains because the data does not show clear evidence to confirm the presence of a companion star.
