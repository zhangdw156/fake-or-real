Two extragalactic survey projects were conducted to examine changes in the fine structure constant, α = e²/hc, by monitoring the [Oiii] doublet at a redshift of approximately z ~ 2. The quasars were selected based on the presence of a bright, unresolved doublet at low resolution. However, the observed lines were too broad at a resolution of 50,000, resulting in no useful data. A second project investigated the interstellar medium (ISM) of proto-galaxies at z > 2. Sodium (Na i) and calcium (Ca ii) absorption lines are typical in our galaxy's ISM but had not been seen in objects with redshifts greater than one. CRIRES allows for the study of the ISM using these significant lines for damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLA) at high redshift, providing valuable insights into the gas's velocity structure. Na i can be used alongside low-ionization lines in UVES spectra to better understand ionization conditions. At lower redshifts, Ca ii often appears in turbulent environments, such as those in merging galaxies, and comparing Na i and Ca ii can effectively indicate gas clumpiness. Quasar HE0251-5550, selected from the H/ESO DLA survey, exhibits a hydrogen column density of log(NHI) = 20.7 DLA and a redshift of z = 2.3, allowing the search for Na i and Ca ii doublets using CRIRES. Although the object was bright enough in the R-band to activate adaptive optics, it remained faint in the H-band (H = 14.6), complicating guiding due to insufficient light reflected back to the detector. While the spectra for the Na i lines achieved the expected signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), no lines were detected, likely due to the system's low metal abundance. Unfortunately, observation conditions worsened during attempts to see the Ca ii lines, resulting in spectra with an inadequately low S/N. Despite the lack of detection, these observations effectively tested the ability to observe such faint targets with CRIRES, especially since high resolution helps minimize the impact of atmospheric lines.
