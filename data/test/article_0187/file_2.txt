This research uses data from ALMA telescopes about distant stars forming in order to understand how much starlight comes directly from stars versus being masked by clouds over time (dust obscuring). We can now track how much light comes from both types over different periods in history (redshift), which helps us understand how much starlight has been obscured throughout its life cycle since after Big Bang era until present day . The findings show that early on there were primarily dusty clouds obscuring most stars but later on they become less prominent causing more visible light coming directly from stars instead . This combined analysis enables scientists to study this phenomenon further using more advanced tools like future telescopes such as James Webb Space Telescope .
