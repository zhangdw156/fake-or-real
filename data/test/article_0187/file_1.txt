underground
We can now use data about how much light comes from stars in different parts underground (at different distances) to understand how much light comes from stars overall over time (how it changes through space). We know that early on in space's history (around when things were young), most new stars formed while being hidden inside clouds but now we have better data showing us what proportion forms above those clouds later on! This will help us understand how much new material forms into stars over time! We also know there's potential for even more detailed studies using future telescopes like James Webb Space Telescope .
