Predicting the sky's signal in the Near Infrared (NIR) range is challenging due to its significant variability. This variability can reach around 15% in strength over small areas. The dominant cause is fluctuations in the bright and numerous OH emission lines, followed by variations in absorption bands of water molecules and other atmospheric components.  The sky's signal has a faint, consistent level about -19 to -19.5 magnitudes in J/H bands. This origin remains unclear. Possible explanations include residual instrumental effects or true sky radiation from Earth's atmosphere. We have conducted research on the variability of this sky background over time and space.  Our findings show that it varies spatially, ranging from 10-150 arcseconds with a maximum amplitude of less than 0.5% compared to the average level. At scales of 10 arcseconds or smaller, the variations reach 0.3â€“0.7%. This is likely an upper limit for actual sky background variability because noise and scattering can be difficult to handle in low-signal-to-noise data. Nonetheless, this demonstrates that accurately subtracting the sky background should be achievable with accuracy of roughly a few tenths of a percent.
