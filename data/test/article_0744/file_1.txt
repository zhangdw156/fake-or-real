The OWL Conceptual Study was finished, and its findings were compiled in the 'Blue Book' report in early October 2005. An international panel conducted a thorough review from November 2 to 5, 2005. The first goal of the review was to evaluate the proposed technical solutions, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the OWL approach, analyzing feasibility concerns, estimating costs and schedules, and identifying key risks and areas needing further investigation. The second goal was to recommend whether and how to advance to the next project phase. The panel commended the OWL team for a detailed and largely successful feasibility study for a 100-meter Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). A significant technical highlight emphasized by the panel was the integrated approach for the OWL active/adaptive optics system, particularly the inclusion of at least one large adaptive mirror in the telescope design. However, considerable technical risks were identified related to OWL's double segmentation, the highly aspherical mirror, and the telescope's size, which complicates its compatibility with Laser Guide Star systems. Due to these risks and the estimated total cost exceeding likely ESO resources available from 2008 to 2020, the panel recommended considering a smaller, less complex, and less risky ELT. It stated that much of the OWL design work and nearly all technological developments thus far would be beneficial for this new phase. Additionally, the panel advised involving the ESO community in all project aspects and expediting the ongoing ELT site selection process, emphasizing the importance of initiating government-level negotiations for site access as soon as possible. The panel ultimately recommended proceeding to Phase B and starting a new assessment of the balance between scientific return, competitiveness, AO performance, instrumentation, risk, and overall performance within a manageable budget. It noted that the timeline for this re-evaluation was already included in the proposals made in the Blue Book.
