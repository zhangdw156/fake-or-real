## ALMA Takes Flight: First Year of Observations Complete! 

Hold onto your hats, folks! The **Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)** just wrapped up its **first year of science observing**, and it was a historic moment for the astronomy world!

We’re talking about **zero-gravity backflips** achieved by the crew onboard the International Space Station! That's right, these folks were defying gravity in true space fashion. **And ALMA just set a new record:** the data collected during its first year of observing is nothing short of groundbreaking! 

The European-led teams have been working tirelessly to bring us this incredible collection of data!  Just like an astronaut mastering the art of zero-gravity backflips, their dedication and precision have led to impressive results. Here’s a closer look:
* **94%** of projects that were meant for first cycle observation actually happened - pretty amazing right?!
* The European PIs in charge of these projects did an incredible job! 35 out of the 26 finished observing projects, with more data ready to be analyzed!

As ALMA kicks off its second year with improved capabilities and even more ambitious goals, this remarkable achievement is a testament to the power of human innovation and collaboration.  We can't wait to see what discoveries await us in the years to come!
