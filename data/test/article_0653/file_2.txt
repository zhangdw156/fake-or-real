ALMA's first year of scientific observations has concluded. ALMA completed its first science observing season (Cycle 0) on January 2, 2013. Despite challenges like new technology still being developed and limitations in processing capacity, ALMA successfully observed and processed data from nearly all high-priority proposals selected for the first cycle.  Of these projects, European Principal Investigators (PIs) led 35 and have now received quality assured data. The remaining nine projects are partially data-complete with partial delivery of existing information.
