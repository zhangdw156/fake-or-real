A virtual testing ground for P1 system features is available for anyone interested in exploring it before its official launch alongside Period 105's call for proposals cycle begins! This space allows you to craft full proposals within an accessible format while practicing submitting them through simulated processes like retractions – keep your confidential data safe as this public platform encourages experimentation but not sharing sensitive information!
You have access to simulate various aspects like instrument selection from La Silla Paranal Observatory across different observation program types such as normal observations or rapid response mode observations – everything you need right there! There are helpful guides explaining each stage along with detailed descriptions on every aspect within this interface called "mini-helps."
Many components within P1's submission process mirror those found on ESOFORM – title fields are familiar as well as abstract fields etc., but theres even more comprehensive assistance readily available via menus or easily accessible help buttons throughout pages.. The platform also includes sample proposals demonstrating how they might be structured along with comments detailing what goes into each field making it easier than ever before! Remember that these changes affect how runsobservations are defined so make sure you familiarize yourself prior to submitting any future applications during Period 105s call for projects deadline .
