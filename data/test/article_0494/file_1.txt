The GALACSI module's performance in tests using ASSIST proved it satisfies system specifications. The module is designed to increase received energy per pixel by a factor of two, within a 60 × 60 arcsecond MUSE field of view at a wavelength of 750 nm, under conditions with 1.1-arcsecond seeing. This was based on a theoretical distribution of atmospheric parameters assumed during system design and simulation. The ASSIST test bench, which uses only three phase screens to mimic turbulence, did not fully represent the true profile, however, it still reproduced measured ensquared energy values accurately.  Based on simulations with the specified atmosphere, the GALACSI module is expected to provide this correction in reality.   

The GALACSI–MUSE narrow-field mode, which involved a novel algorithm for laser tomography, proved more challenging than the GRAAL ground layer adaptive optics correction. This algorithm's effectiveness was confirmed beyond expectations by simulation and testing on ASSIST, although some difficulty was encountered in measuring the Strehl ratio values at 650 nm (a key measurement for adaptive optics). Despite these difficulties, significant image improvement is observed as measured by the Strehl ratio, which exceeds even that of a typical 82% Strehl ratio at 2.2 μm wavelength.  
 
Despite the challenges, the algorithm proved to be robust and effective even in challenging seeing conditions (1.1-arcsecond seeing) and maintained stability without requiring adjustments to the control matrix as atmospheric parameters changed. This simplicity will make operations easier in the future.
