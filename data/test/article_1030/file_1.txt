New Infrastructures Need New Training: The Case of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer Schools  
The field of astronomy is expanding significantly with the development and operation of new, ambitious facilities. A vital part of the benefits from these facilities is the training of their users. We discuss a series of summer schools aimed at educating a new generation of young astronomers in optical interferometry using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. It has been eleven years since the Very Large Telescope (VLT) began operation. The past decade has been productive for astronomy, with key terms like “dark energy” and “exoplanets” making their first appearances in respected journal articles around ten years ago. The advancement of astronomical discovery hinges on well-planned new facilities and infrastructure. The last ten years have seen the use of the VLT and the VLTI, the initial planning and construction of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the planning of the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT). These new facilities are expected to become operational in the next decade. The E-ELT will greatly enhance sensitivity, allowing for investigations such as the acceleration of the Universe. The significant improvements of the ALMA interferometer in resolving power and sensitivity focus on three main scientific objectives, including the examination of the physics and chemistry of planet-forming discs around young stars. New possibilities also bring new challenges, as highlighted by the ASTRONET Infrastructure Road-map: “Recruiting and training the future generation of Europeans with advanced scientific and technological skills is therefore a key aspect of any realistic Roadmap for the future.” Training new astronomers in new observational methods is crucial as new facilities become available. This article presents the successful experiences from the VLTI training schools project ONTHEFRINGE, which occurred from January 2006 to December 2008.
