**New Infrastructures Require New Training: The Example of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer Schools**

Astronomy is expanding rapidly due to the creation and operation of new long-term projects. A vital part of benefiting from these facilities is ensuring that users receive proper training. We discuss a series of summer schools aimed at educating young astronomers in optical interferometry using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. The Very Large Telescope (VLT) was first operational eleven years ago, launching a dynamic period for the field. Concepts such as "dark energy" and "exoplanets" became part of scholarly titles for the first time approximately a decade ago. Successful discover in astronomy relies on the establishment of well-designed facilities and infrastructure. In the past ten years, scientists have deployed the VLT and the VLT Interferometer (VLTI), initiated the planning and early building of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and started designing the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT). These new projects are set to become operational in the upcoming decade. The E-ELT is expected to greatly enhance sensitivity, allowing detailed exploration of the Universe's expansion. The ALMA interferometer's significant improvements in clarity and sensitivity target three main scientific goals, including researching the materials superconducting disks surrounding new stars. While new possibilities arise, they also present new difficulties, highlighted in the ASTRONET Infrastructure Road-map, which states, "Recruiting and training the future generation of Europeans with advanced scientific and technological skills is crucial for any practical roadmap for the future." It is essential to train upcoming astronomers in new observational methods as new facilities begin working. This article outlines the successful training experiences of the VLTI schools project ONTHEFRINGE, which occurred from January 2006 to December 2008.
