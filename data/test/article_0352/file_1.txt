This paper details the discovery and further investigation of a particularly bright sub-mm galaxy at a redshift of 2.32. This galaxy was discovered in 2009 using the LABOCA instrument on APEX, exhibiting a brightness of 106 mJy at 870 µm due to gravitational magnification from a nearby massive galaxy cluster. Follow-up observations by APEX SABOCA and Swedish Heterodyne Facility Instrument provided data regarding its infrared spectral energy distribution, allowing for the measurement of star formation rates, and the investigation of cold molecular gas excitation. High resolution sub-mm array observations then resolved star-forming regions on scales of just 100 parsecs. These findings provide a level of detail into galaxy formation and evolution that has never been achieved before, offering insight into their early history. The paper discusses how these galaxies might be the building blocks for today’s massive elliptical galaxies. However, some scientists find it counterintuitive due to theoretical inconsistencies with these conclusions. There are theoretical challenges that need addressing using sophisticated models, including modified prescriptions for starbursts and exotic physics like significant variations in stellar initial mass function, which may be needed. While this remains controversial, current evidence suggests an increased pressure within the warm dense gas of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) leads to increased Jeans mass. To test these theoretical claims, direct observational constraints on the properties of individual star-forming regions are needed for high redshift galaxies. This would require technologies capable of higher collecting area and sensitivity found in upcoming telescopes like the Extremely Large Telescopes currently being developed and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA).  These distant galaxies are obscured due to their intense star formation activity, making them difficult to study using existing telescopes and technology.
