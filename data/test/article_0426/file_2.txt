Lunar eclipses offer a unique opportunity to study Earth's atmosphere in ways similar to observing exoplanets.  During these events, minute amounts of starlight passing through Earth's atmosphere leave behind traces of atmospheric composition and altitude. These signatures are detected through photometry, which is often complemented with spectrophotometry. This allows us to analyze the atmospheres of other planets and has been a valuable source for learning about planetary atmospheres beyond our own solar system.  These studies of lunar eclipses have provided a foundation for future characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres. Because these atmospheric signatures are so small in comparison to the total light, photometric observations require high precision and stability, which can be achieved effectively in space. Ground-based observatories might need continuous monitoring of standard stars within their field of view. Another technique known as the Rossiter–McLaughlin (RM) effect allows for the measurement of the planet's effective radius and variation with wavelength based on precise radial velocity measurements outside and within the transit event, rather than relying solely on the photometric observation of tiny light variations. This method leverages the masking of different parts of the stellar disk as the transit occurs to produce varying combinations of stellar rotation and surface motion depending on the planet's position in the stellar disk and its effective radius. Since the effective radius is a proxy for light variation across wavelengths, radial velocity measurements provide information about the planet’s atmospheric composition. This RM effect approach provides an advantage over photometry since it requires less precision, making it suitable for use with large ground-based telescopes equipped with stable high-resolution spectrometers.  Such a technique eliminates the need to monitor reference stars. To test and investigate the feasibility of this RM-based method, we applied it to observations of a lunar eclipse captured by the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planetary Searcher (HARPS) spectrograph on the 3.6-meter telescope at La Silla. The application enabled us to obtain an atmospheric transmission spectrum that clearly reveals Rayleigh scattering and ozone Chappuis band absorption.
