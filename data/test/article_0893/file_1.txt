The ESO-ESA Working Group on Fundamental Cosmology  
In September 2003, the leaders of ESO and ESA decided to create several working groups to explore potential collaborations on key scientific topics between their two major European astronomical organizations. The first reports from these groups were published in 2005 and 2006, and the report on Fundamental Cosmology has recently been finalized. This article outlines the main findings and recommendations of this group, which includes members John Peacock, Peter Schneider, George Efstathiou, Jonathan R. Ellis, Bruno Leibundgut, Simon Lilly, and Yannick Mellier. Additional colleagues contributed significantly to the report as well. The ST-ECF, particularly Bob Fosbury and Wolfram Freudling, helped support several in-person meetings in Garching. The group focused on fundamental questions in cosmology, intentionally excluding recent advances in astrophysical cosmology, such as galaxy formation, reionization, and the first stars. However, many of our suggested actions will generate large datasets that can also greatly influence these wider areas of astronomy. This is a fitting time to assess the field. The last 10-15 years have brought significant advancements in our understanding of cosmology, leading to a well-defined standard model that explains nearly all cosmologically relevant observations. Considerable observational resources have already been invested, making the next generation of experiments likely to be costly. Future cosmological projects will require resources akin to those in particle physics, both financially and in terms of personnel. Thus, it is crucial to identify the most fundamental problems with the best chances for resolution. While it is challenging to predict future priorities, as they will likely change, planning for and executing large-scale new experiments will require time. We aim for our report to extend to around 2020, so ESAâ€™s Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 document has been an important part of our discussions.
