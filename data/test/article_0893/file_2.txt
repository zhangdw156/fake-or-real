The ESO-ESA Working Group on Fundamental Cosmology  
In September 2003, the leaders of ESO and ESA decided to create several working groups to explore potential collaborations on key scientific topics between their two major European astronomical institutions. The first reports from the working groups emerged in 2005 and 2006, and the report on Fundamental Cosmology has recently been finalized. This article outlines the main findings and recommendations of this group, whose members include John Peacock, Peter Schneider, George Efstathiou, Jonathan R. Ellis, Bruno Leibundgut, Simon Lilly, and Yannick Mellier. Additional valuable contributions to the report came from several colleagues. Financial support for a number of meetings held in Garching was provided by the ST-ECF, especially by Bob Fosbury and Wolfram Freudling. The group's main focus was on essential issues in cosmology, which led to excluding investigations of recent developments in astrophysical cosmology, including galaxy formation, reionization, and the initial stars. Nevertheless, many of our recommended initiatives will generate extensive and broadly applicable datasets that will significantly influence wider areas of astronomy. This is a timely moment to evaluate the field. Over the last 10-15 years, there have been great improvements in our understanding of cosmology, leading to a comprehensive standard model that explains almost all key cosmological observations. Significant observational resources have already been allocated, indicating that future experiments are likely to require considerable funding. The size of forthcoming cosmological projects may rival that of particle physics, in both cost and workforce. Therefore, we need to ascertain which issues are the most fundamental and have the highest chances of resolution. However, it is difficult to forecast future priorities accurately, as they are likely to change over time. It will also require substantial time to plan and execute new large experiments. We aim for our report to address concerns relevant to approximately 2020, incorporating insights from ESA's Cosmic Vision 2015â€“2025 document into our discussions.
