Research on the chemical complexity and structure of the molecular interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial for ALMA operations. John Bieging outlined the importance of comprehensive mapping of the molecular clouds' structure to understand the influence of massive stars and their development. The high-resolution images of dust and emissions will enable researchers to investigate the origins and effects of turbulence on how molecular clouds fragment. Alain Baudry highlighted the significant capabilities of the ALMA correlator in discovering new molecules within the ISM. Molecular concentrations fluctuate depending on their evolutionary state, with various species appearing or disappearingâ€”as some become depleted on dust grains. An array of molecular species can serve as indicators of intricate physical and chemical processes, and the capability to simulate these phenomena at high spatial resolution is viewed as a crucial supplement to ALMA results. Eric Herbst reviewed chemical models, revealing how molecular concentrations differ depending on the stages of star formation in molecular clouds. Aina Palau further explored the distinctive patterns of nitrogen-containing molecules in environments where intermediate mass stars form. Javier Rodriguez-Goicoechea ended with a presentation on the chemical changes witnessed in photodissociation regions created by UV light from massive stars.
