Research on the chemical complexity and structure of the molecular interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial for ALMA. John Bieging discussed how mapping the structure of molecular clouds helps us understand the influence of massive stars and their development. The detailed, high-resolution images capturing dust and line emissions will enable scientists to investigate the origin and effects of turbulence in the fragmentation of molecular clouds. Alain Baudry highlighted the significant capabilities of the ALMA correlator in discovering new molecules within the ISM. Molecular concentrations change depending on their evolutionary state, with various species appearing and disappearing, such as through adsorption onto dust grains. Many molecular species can serve as indicators of the intricate physics and chemistry, and being able to model these processes at high spatial resolution is essential for complementing ALMA observations. Eric Herbst reviewed chemical models, illustrating how molecular concentrations shift with the stages of star formation in molecular clouds. Aina Palau examined the intriguing behaviors of nitrogen-containing molecules in molecular clouds that form intermediate-mass stars. Lastly, Javier Rodriguez-Goicoechea presented the chemical impacts noted in photodissociation regions created by ultraviolet radiation from massive stars.
