The "Wide Area VISTA Extragalactic Survey" (WAVES), part of a larger consortium called "4MOST," aims to understand how galaxies have grown in size over seven billion years from tiny clusters out on large distances up close at smaller sizes within those clusters . They'll use this data alongside computer simulations that mimic reality to test theories about how dark matter formed galaxies we see today . The survey focuses on various things like:
Large scale: Tracking large groupings like filaments voids formed during cosmic evolution across vast distances covering billions years
Intermediate scale: Examining group sizes masses along with their formation rates; providing insights into how dark matter clumps together around stars forming galactic bodies
Small scale: Measuring precise distances environments for individual galaxies near celestial bodies; helping researchers learn about how galactic shapes evolve
Overall this project tracks nearly two million galaxies across different redshifts - revealing new information about early universe development spanning both distant regions far away from us today as well as more nearby ones where we can observe them more closely..
