Identifying what creates diffuse interstellar bands (DIB), strong absorption lines found across redder star spectra since they were first noticed nearly one century ago has been difficult fruitfully studied fruits have yet been widely sought after fruitfulness needs confirmation before its impact can be fully realized however despite still being largely unknown these bands have become increasingly valuable tools for mapping out our galaxy' while they remain unidentified we continue using them fruitfully one day researchers will identify which specific chemicals create these bands allowing us better understand our galaxy this could lead us deeper into understanding how galaxies form new stars etc fruitful research efforts involve comparing lab experiments focused on low temperature gas phases with those observed within space through high resolution imaging techniques this allows us to compare measurements made from both sides allowing researchers access into determining which elements may have created these unique lines some researchers focus narrowly upon specific parts or even entire datasets while others look at averages among many individual ones it'll require comprehensive surveys covering various wavelengths across different typesenvironments including those conducted by projects like EDIBLES
