Astronomers have long struggled to identify what causes "diffuse interstellar bands" (DIB). These strong absorption lines appear across many red stars' spectra but originate from unknown sources within space dust clouds called nebulae . Scientists suspect these bands may be made up stable molecules like carbon chains or fullerenes which exist abundantly even under harsh conditions found within nebulae . They use these mysterious bands as tools for mapping space' lab experiments help confirm which specific molecule creates them while observing those same molecules under simulated space conditions could further reveal details about how they form , including their size , shape , energy levels ,and whether they contain ions . While researchers have made progress identifying certain characteristics like line shapes intensities they need broader surveys across various wavelengths environmental settings like EDIBLES project done by ESO telescopes to fully understand this complex phenomenon .
