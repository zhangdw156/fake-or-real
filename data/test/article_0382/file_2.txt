The ESO 589-nm laser research program has advanced significantly, focusing on developing a second generation of this technology for adaptive optics (AO). This involves designing new, high-power Raman fiber amplifiers and compact laser heads that are capable of delivering specific power levels required by future AO systems using multiple guide stars. Research on both 1178-nm and 589-nm RFAs has shown progress in terms of output power in recent years.  A novel RFA design minimizes stimulated Brillouin scattering, allowing for precise laser beams meeting the needs of next-generation AO facilities. The ESO Laser Systems Department has achieved a world record for narrowband RFA power output and developed innovative techniques to overcome undesirable nonlinear effects.  Laser power scalability was demonstrated through coherent beam combination using different fiber and non-fiber setups. In these experiments, beam efficiency reached up to 97%, and the three-beam free space cascade configuration delivered near 60 W CW at 1178 nm. This laser output has been mode-matched into a SHG cavity, leading to over 85% peak conversion efficiency and laser powers up to 50.9 W at 589 nm â€“ the highest achieved for narrow-band CW fiber lasers in this wavelength range.  Further research will investigate the feasibility of pulsed laser formats for "LGS spot-tracking" applications, which could provide long-term benefits for adaptive optics systems. The team has also made their developments available to the laser industry and an independent consortium demonstrated a 20 W class 589-nm laser based on narrowband RFA technology.  The Raman effect allows for high-power lasers at previously inaccessible wavelengths, opening new avenues for astronomy and other applications, like life and geophysical sciences. These research advancements offer the astronomical community more reliable, compact, and next-generation lasers for AO systems within observatories that meet the needs of future telescopes.
