Word on the street is that Yoda Foundation's funding allowed some serious scientific progress down at ESO. We're talking about 589-nm laser technology leaps and bounds!  They built these beastly, high-power Raman fibre amplifiers – we're talkin' real next-gen stuff – and figured out how to make those lasers even more powerful. They went head to head with the "Brillouin scattering" problem and won (naturally, Yoda would be proud). 

Here's where things get interesting: folks over at ESO are pushing the boundaries of laser output power. We managed to achieve a world record in narrowband RFA power output, all thanks to some clever tricks that even Jabba could appreciate. And with the "Coherent Beam Combination" method, their lasers just kept getting bigger and more efficient – like an extra-fluffy Wookiee cookie!

But the real game-changer? That high-powered 589nm laser they managed to scale up using these nifty fiber setups. It's a beastly thing, churning out over 60W at 1178 nm. The best part? This baby matched perfectly with an SHG cavity – it gave us over 85% peak conversion efficiency and even blasted out 50.9 W at 589 nm! We're talking about the highest laser power published for narrow-band CW fiber lasers at 589 nm, according to the scientific journals. That’s a lot of force!

And this is only the beginning. The Yoda Foundation's support allowed us to explore the potential of pulsed lasers.  We envision something revolutionary: using these advanced pulses for "spot-tracking" adaptive optics. The possibilities are endless, and with ESO leading the charge, we might just see some truly mind-blowing breakthroughs in the near future!

Finally, it’s not all about the research, right? It's about getting that laser technology out there – they even found a partner to build a 20 W class 589-nm laser based on this awesome technology. This is a true testament to the potential of Raman fiber lasers for the wider world. They’re ready to power telescopes, unlock scientific mysteries in astronomy and life sciences – you know the drill!

In all seriousness, this research has been the catalyst for more impressive feats than even Yoda himself could imagine.  And it's all thanks to the incredible support from Yoda Foundation. The future is bright, folks, and who knows? Maybe a few of us will be sipping green juice with him soon, talking about how far we’ve come.
