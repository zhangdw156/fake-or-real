Integral Field Spectroscopy  
An integral field spectrograph (IFS) for planet imaging is difficult to develop but is considered a very valuable tool for finding planets. This is due to two main reasons: First, the IFS can be created with almost no differences in image quality, and second, its multiple spectral channels improve the correction of light distortion and support analysis methods that don't depend on specific features being assumed in the planetâ€™s spectrum. For the SPHERE project, we are working on a micro-lens-based IFS model that builds on the traditional TIGER design, adjusted for high-contrast observations. The system is aimed to achieve a 5 sigma detectivity at 0.5 arcseconds of 10^-7, with the target set at 10^-8 relative to the un-occulted point spread function peak. The IFS operates in the Y-J bands (0.95 to 1.35 micrometers), which allows it to use a single detection channel and work alongside IRDIS. It maintains a resolving power of 30 per pixel, with a minimum field of view of 1.35 arcseconds square and an aspirational goal of 3 arcseconds square. Spatial sampling at 0.95 micrometers follows Nyquist's limit, similar to IRDIS. Optimizing the compatibility between IFS and IRDIS in terms of the detector and related equipment is a key objective, so we are using the same 2k by 2k detector format, and it's likely that the long-wavelength cutoff set for IRDIS will also work for IFS. The design details include a micro-lens array, collimation optics, an Amici Prism that offers no beam deviation and consistent resolution across the wavelength range, camera optics, and the detector cryostat.
