Integral Field Spectroscopy  
An integral field spectrograph (IFS) for planet imaging is difficult to develop but is viewed as a highly valuable tool for instruments searching for planets. This is because the IFS can be made with almost no differential distortions and its multiple spectral channels improve the correction of color variations in speckle and enable data-analysis methods that do not depend on pre-existing features in the planet's spectrum. For SPHERE, the focus is on a micro-lens-based IFS concept derived from the classic TIGER idea, adapted for high-contrast diffraction-limited observations. The project aims to achieve a 5-sigma detectivity at 0.5 arcseconds of \(10^{-7}\), with a goal to reach \(10^{-8}\) concerning the unblocked point spread function peak. The IFS operates within the Y-J bands (0.95 to 1.35 micrometers), using a single detection channel and allowing for simultaneous operation with IRDIS and IFS. It maintains a resolution of 30 per pixel, with a minimum field of view of 1.35 arcseconds square and an objective of 3 arcseconds square. Nyquist-limited spatial sampling at 0.95 micrometers is enforced similarly to IRDIS. Achieving consistency between IFS and IRDIS headers and other system components is a key aim. Thus, the same 2k by 2k detector format will be used, and it is likely the wavelength cutoff set for IRDIS will also be suitable for IFS. Details on the opto-mechanical design, such as the micro-lens array, collimation optics, an Amici Prism that produces no beam deviation while maintaining consistent resolution across the spectrum, camera optics, and the detector's cryostat, are provided.
