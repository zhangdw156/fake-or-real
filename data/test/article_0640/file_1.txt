SDP.81 is a submillimeter galaxy that has gravitational lensing from an intervening elliptical galaxy. It was first discovered through the Herschel ATLAS survey. Further observations in the millimetre continuum, CO, and H2O molecular lines were made using the Submillimeter Array and Plateau de Bure Interferometer. The ALMA Large Program for the LBC (ALMA LBC) involved observing it across Bands 4, 6, and 7 to capture different spectral lines of CO (J=5-4, J=8-7, J=10-9). Although some details are missing in ALMA IV, the CO morphology broadly matches the continuum, with two main arcs. However, the emission within those arcs is more clumped.  The spatial integration of CO profiles reveals a separation between two components, moving at approximately 300 km/s, where the lower velocity component dominates the western arc. Thermal H2O was detected in the eastern arc and low-resolution observations showed some evidence of this emission in the western arc. However, only shorter baselines were used for these detections. These findings made ALMA's CO detection the most accurate to date. The water emission was found in a specific velocity component, consistent with previous observations. Subsequent studies have used the ALMA LBC data for mass modeling of the lensing elliptical galaxy and suggest either a stellar core with a high mass-to-light ratio or a black hole greater than 3 x 10‚Å∏ solar masses if an active galactic nucleus (AGN) is present. Other researchers have modeled the background starburst galaxy and found that dust clumps are not uniformly distributed in the galaxy.  They suggest that the background is undergoing collapse in a disc shape, further indicating possible merging systems as suggested by the data compared to HST observations. The ALMA LBC datasets continue to be analyzed, with new results expected.
