High-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope are available in both the FDF and GOODS-S. We use these images to analyze galaxy shapes to differentiate between disc-dominated and bulge-dominated galaxies by examining their surface brightness profiles up to redshift ~ 1. We discover that the mass at which disc galaxies make up the total mass function decreases over time, indicating that since redshift ~ 1, mass has shifted from disc-dominated galaxies to bulge-dominated ones. By comparing specific star-formation rates in these two types of galaxies, we conclude that merging events, rather than star formation, are crucial in this transition. These samples allow us to observe the formation of galaxies in detail for the first time. Additionally, theoretical models of galaxy formation can utilize this data to compare a wide range of observables to their predictions. Future surveys will offer even better constraints on current observables and will include more observables for each galaxy, ultimately leading to a complete understanding of the star-formation and merging history of galaxies.
