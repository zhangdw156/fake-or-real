The discussion session addressed several key questions: what are the main collaborations between the facilities? Which ELT instruments or ALMA upgrades would enhance these collaborations? Should the communities of these facilities be more unified? Is there a need to create formal connections between these communities? Should systematic programs be implemented with ALMA to prepare for ELT observations? These questions were explored in various sessions and included in the conference summary by James Di Francesco. The general consensus was that there are strong synergies across all areas of astrophysics, and the community has identified most of these and is preparing to tackle the challenges. Young astronomers are being trained in various wavelength domains and are proactively preparing to utilize the data from the large facilities. However, additional collaborative activities should be organized to maintain progress, and institutions should aim to hire a diverse group of researchers from both communities. High-resolution optical and infrared spectrographs, as well as near-/mid-infrared imagers and integral field spectrographs, would significantly enhance ELT and ALMA synergies, while ALMA could benefit from long baselines and Bands 1 and 5. Although formal connections between the projects seem premature now, they will certainly be considered in the future. More importantly, data from all facilities should be accessible to the whole community, and analysis tools should be designed to be user-friendly for non-experts. This underscores the tremendous impact that combining ALMA with ELTs will have across observational astrophysics and cosmology, including planetary science and fundamental physics. Exciting developments in astronomy are anticipated over the next two decades. A 30-page summary booklet of the workshop will be published in 2009.
