In studying the formation of low mass stars, it was observed that the processes that transform molecular clouds into stars cannot be fully tracked at this time. Future progress relies on new technology, particularly the ALMA telescope. Stars appear in the central regions of molecular clouds by accumulating material onto protostellar cores. However, we still lack a detailed understanding of how this process works in terms of movement and dynamics, including the formation and targeting of outflows and the later development of surrounding discs into planetary systems, asteroids, and comets. It seems that magnetic fields might be important in this process, though their role remains unclear. Frédéric Gueth shared recent high-resolution observations of molecular outflows captured with the IRAM interferometer, arguing that ALMA will provide insights into the central areas of young stars, revealing complex structures and the movement of material in outflows and accretion. Stephane Guilloteau highlighted ALMA's potential for exploring the formation and evolution of circumstellar discs, stating it will offer detailed views of physical conditions, motion, and chemical changes in these discs through high-resolution images of many molecular lines. Gaps in these discs expected from planet formation may also be directly captured by ALMA. Josep Miquel Girart discussed the anticipated impact of magnetic fields on star formation, presenting images of dust polarisation from the Sub-mm Array and comparing outcomes of low and high mass star formation, noting that the hourglass shape of the magnetic field is observed in both scenarios.
