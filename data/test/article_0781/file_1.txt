In the study of low mass star formation, it was observed that the detailed processes that transform molecular clouds into stars are currently unclear. Advancements in understanding depend on new technology, particularly ALMA. Stars develop in the core regions of molecular clouds by accumulating material onto protostellar cores, but the specifics of the kinematics and dynamics of this process are not well understood. This includes the formation and direction of outflows, as well as how circumstellar discs evolve into planetary systems, asteroids, and comets. The role of magnetic fields is thought to be significant, but is not yet fully understood. Frédéric Gueth shared recent findings from high-resolution molecular outflow observations using the IRAM interferometer and emphasized that ALMA will be able to visualize the central areas of young stellar objects, revealing the complex structure and motion of both outflowing and accumulating material. Stephane Guilloteau discussed how ALMA could enhance our understanding of the formation and evolution of circumstellar discs, offering detailed images of the physical conditions, kinematics, and chemical changes within these discs by capturing multiple lines of various molecules at high resolution. ALMA will also be able to directly image the gaps predicted to form in circumstellar discs due to planet formation. Josep Miquel Girart addressed the anticipated influence of magnetic fields in star formation, presenting images of dust polarization obtained with the Sub-mm Array and comparing the findings between low mass and high mass star formation. In both scenarios, the expected hourglass pattern of the magnetic field was observed.
