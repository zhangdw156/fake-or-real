The July release of the X-shooter Commissioning data features 4,594 files collected over 24 nights during four commissioning periods. The first two commissioning sessions used only the UV-B and VIS-R arms, whereas the third and fourth sessions included the UV-B, VIS-R, and NIR arms. Public HARPS data packages generated by the automatic HARPS pipeline were released in June through the ESO Science Archive Facility. Each package contains several related files: a flat-fielded 2D spectrum; a flattened, de-blazed, wavelength-calibrated, and combined 1D spectrum; a cross-correlation function; an integrated guiding image (when available); and a 1D bisector. These packages cover the first six years of operation. For comparison, the initial release in January 2008 had packages covering the first four years of HARPS operations, and no changes were made to those original release packages. The VIMOS imaging data release version 1.0 of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey was issued in April. This release, which pertains to the Chandra Deep Field South, includes co-added images in U-band from a large ESO program collected during service mode observations between mid-2004 and late 2006. It also features a co-added R-band image from a data retrieval from the ESO archive, with a detailed account of the data reduction process available in an accompanying publication.
