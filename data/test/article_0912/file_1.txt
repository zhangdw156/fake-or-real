The July release of the X-shooter Commissioning data features 4,594 files collected over 24 nights during four commissioning periods. The first two periods only used the UV-B and VIS-R arms, while the third and fourth included the UV-B, VIS-R, and NIR arms. Public HARPS data packages generated by the automatic HARPS pipeline were made available in June through the ESO Science Archive Facility. Each package contains related files: a 2D spectrum that is extracted and flat-fielded; a 1D spectrum that is extracted, flat-fielded, de-blazed, wavelength calibrated, and order merged; a cross-correlation function; an integrated guiding image (if available); and a 1D bisector. These packages span the first six years of operation. In comparison, the initial release in January 2008 included packages for the first four years of HARPS operations. The original release packages from 2008 have not been modified. Additionally, version 1.0 of the VIMOS imaging data release for the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey was issued in April. This release, covering the Chandra Deep Field South, includes co-added U-band images from the ESO Large Programme collected during service mode from mid-2004 to late 2006, as well as a co-added R-band image obtained from archived data. A full description of the data reduction process is provided in an accompanying publication.
