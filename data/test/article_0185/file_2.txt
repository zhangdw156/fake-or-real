The four MOST consortium plans a major survey using data from NASA's eROSITA telescope starting in late springearly summer, with observations planned over several years starting around that time frame . This project focuses on studying galaxy groupings by detecting their hot gas emissions through x-rays, mapping out their positions with high accuracy using spectroscopy . The goal is two fold: First, determine how much matter each grouping contains by measuring its movement; second , figure out what kind(s) each group comprises based upon its members' color patterns (redshifts). This information can help us understand how these groupings affect individual stars within them; then we can use this knowledge about them together with other telescopes like Hubble Space Telescope or James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) , which observe different parts or wavelengths than just x-rays but still give us clues about these groupings! In addition , they plan on mapping out large filament structures that connect various groupings across vast distances within our universe! These findings could help scientists understand how dark matter interacts with regular matter in galaxy formations over time!
