At first glance, our findings for the dust structures in the Seyfert 2 galaxies NGC 1068 and Circinus appear quite similar; both have an elongated inner section that is part of a larger dust distribution, heated to around 300 K. The differences in torus size are expected because NGC 1068 is roughly 10 times more luminous than Circinus. In both cases, the inner section is in line with the location of water masers. However, the differences between the two galaxies are also quite significant: only NGC 1068 has dust heated to nearly the burning temperature, whereas Circinus lacks a clear temperature difference between the innermost dust and the outer parts of the torus. Additionally, the hot dust in NGC 1068 is noticeably tilted. The outer torus of Circinus appears uneven or filament-like, aligning with predictions from hydrodynamical models. The low absorption depth in the silicate feature of the inner component suggests our line of sight through the dust disk is not heavily obstructed by the outer structure, indicating that most of the hydrogen column near the X-ray core is located within a radius of 0.2 pc. Conversely, NGC 1068 shows a sizable dust column in the direction of the hot component, primarily due to the absorbing gas and dust being found outside of a radius of approximately 1 pc. 

These distinctions indicate that the torus in the Circinus galaxy is not merely a smaller model of that in NGC 1068. This leads to the question of whether a universal torus exists in Seyfert galaxies. Regardless, the torus demonstrates a complex structure that seems to be different (possibly due to viewing angles) and may fundamentally vary from one active galaxy nucleus (AGN) to another. This notion can coexist with the basic understanding of unified classifications, maintaining that Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s could genuinely belong to the same type of objects. To confirm this hypothesis, it will need to be shown that tori similar to those in NGC 1068 and Circinus also match the characteristics of Seyfert 1 galaxies. The detection of an extended component in NGC 4151 using MIDI represents a significant initial step toward answering this question. Finally, our findings regarding Centaurus A illustrate that simply lacking broad emission lines is not always due to the presence of an obscuring torus, and that intrinsic aspects of the black holeâ€™s accretion flow might also play a crucial role.
