At first glance, our findings on the dust structures in the Seyfert 2 galaxies NGC 1068 and Circinus appear quite similar; both have an elongated inner section surrounded by a larger dust distribution heated to around 300 K. The difference in the size of the torus is expected because NGC 1068 is roughly 10 times more luminous than Circinus. In both cases, the inner section aligns with water maser locations. However, the differences between the two galaxies may be even more pronounced: only NGC 1068 has dust heated to nearly the sublimation temperature, and Circinus lacks a significant temperature difference between the innermost dust and the outer parts of the torus. Furthermore, the hot dust in NGC 1068 is noticeably tilted, while the outer torus in Circinus looks patchy or filament-like, consistent with hydrodynamical models. The low absorption depth in the silicate feature for the inner component suggests that our view of the dust disk is not heavily obscured by the outer structure, and most of the hydrogen column toward the X-ray core is within a radius of 0.2 pc. In contrast, NGC 1068 has a much larger dust column facing the hot component, with most absorbing gas and dust located outside a radius of approximately 1 pc. 

These differences indicate that the torus in the Circinus galaxy is not merely a smaller version of the one in NGC 1068. This raises the question of whether there is a standard torus in Seyfert galaxies. Regardless, the 'torus' has a complex structure that not only looks different due to perspective effects but may also differ intrinsically among individual Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This does not necessarily conflict with the core idea of the unified model, as Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s could still be fundamentally the same type of object. To confirm this general assumption, it is necessary to prove that similar tori, like those in NGC 1068 and Circinus, also exist in Seyfert 1 galaxies. The discovery of an extended component in NGC 4151 using MIDI represents a promising first step in this direction. Lastly, our findings on Centaurus A show that the lack of broad emission lines cannot always be attributed to an obscuring torus; intrinsic properties of the accretion flow onto the black hole could also be significant.
