In this situation, it's important to note the following points: the amount and quality of data that Gaia will deliver will significantly transform the study of the Galaxy, even more than Hipparcos changed our understanding of the Solar Neighborhood; large and representative samples are needed for various dynamic, kinematic, and compositional analyses of the Galaxy, making surveys very effective for this purpose; we need to develop the means to fill in the gaps left by Gaia, such as high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up for numerous targets chosen from Gaia data, medium-resolution spectroscopy for many faint stars that won't have spectroscopic data from Gaia, and achieving broad wavelength coverage in both photometry and spectroscopy; advancements in infrared astronomy will help us utilize these wavelengths for astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric inspections of the hidden Galactic Bulge and the Galaxy's center; work in stellar population science requires visible (including blue) spectra of stars in the Galaxy as well, not just infrared data that is commonly used in cosmology; accurately interpreting the vast amounts of data from Gaia will require substantial advancements in theory, modeling, and analysis methodologies.
