In this situation, it's important to note a few points: the amount and quality of data that Gaia will deliver will significantly transform the study of the Galaxy, even more than Hipparcos changed our understanding of the Solar Neighborhood; large and statistically significant samples are necessary for conducting various studies on the Galaxyâ€™s dynamics, motion, and composition, and surveys are well-suited for this purpose; it will be essential to develop the ability to address areas that Gaia will not cover, such as high-resolution spectroscopy for many selected targets from Gaia data, medium-resolution spectroscopy for many selected faint stars lacking Gaia spectroscopic data, and achieving broad wavelength coverage in photometry and spectroscopy; advancements in infrared astronomy will enable us to utilize infrared wavelengths for astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric studies of the hidden Galactic Bulge and the Galaxy's central region; stellar population research requires access to visible (including blue) spectra of stars in the Galaxy, not just the infrared that is often used in cosmological studies; accurately interpreting such a vast amount of data requires considerable advancements in theory, modeling, and analysis techniques.
