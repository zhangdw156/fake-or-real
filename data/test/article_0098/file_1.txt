NEAR uses two methods to reduce starlight interference when searching for exoplanets: an advanced grating technique called AGPM (which uses diamond) or shaped pupil masks (which manipulate light distribution). Both techniques effectively increase contrast by up to 100 times but were chosen based on their superior performance - particularly higher throughput that minimizes "ghost" effects caused by starlight on sensitive detectors - making them ideal for detecting faint planets around stars like those found within our own solar system's Centauri constellation .
To ensure precise centering even with slight shifts in star position due its small inner working angle design , scientists developed "Quadrant Analysis Of Coronagraphic Images For Tip-Tilt Sensing" (QACITS). This method measures tiny shifts based on images captured through telescopes using detectors â€“ allowing for real time adjustments needed during observations . After fine tuning this algorithm , it successfully centered stars precisely without any drift within just one hundredth part per million resolution elements . This highlights how sophisticated technology can compensate for inherent limitations while maximizing results while searching beyond our solar systems boundaries .
