The Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) for the ESO/VLT telescope is an important advancement towards an ideal instrument. MUSE is being developed by a group of six major European institutes. It is an integral-field spectrograph (IFU) that offers a wide field of view, high spatial resolution, medium resolving power, and a large simultaneous spectral range. Integral-field spectroscopy is now commonly used in modern telescopes, but most existing integral-field spectrographs have a limited field of view and focus on detailed studies of individual objects. Some multi-IFUs, like Giraffe at the VLT, can observe about a dozen objects at once, increasing their efficiency without changing the standard three-step process of imaging, selection, and spectrography. MUSE has three modes of operation: a wide-field mode that can operate with or without adaptive optics correction, and a narrow-field mode providing high spatial resolution. The observational details are shown in Table 1. The total amount of data collected is calculated by multiplying the number of spaxels (90,000) by the number of spectral pixels (4000), resulting in 360 million elements in the final data cubes. Such a high pixel count cannot be handled by a single optics piece and detector, so MUSE consists of 24 identical modules, each containing an advanced slicer, a spectrograph, and a 4k detector. Various fore-optics, along with splitting and relay optics, separate and rearrange the square field of view into 24 subfields, positioned on the Nasmyth platform between the VLT's focal plane and the IFU modules. Adaptive optics correction will be provided by the VLT's deformable secondary mirror. Four sodium laser guide stars, along with one natural star for tip/tilt adjustment, are used; all guide stars are located outside the scientific field of view to reduce scattered light. The only optic within the scientific field is an innovative Na notch filter, which minimizes transmission losses compared to traditional adaptive optics systems. This complex adaptive optics setup is part of the wider VLT adaptive optics facility, with the specific MUSE component called GALACSI. In the narrow-field mode, an additional optical system is added to the fore-optics to refine the spatial sampling from 0.2 arcsec to 0.025 arcsec, which reduces the field of view to 7.5 × 7.5 arcsec. The main changes involve adjusting the adaptive optics configuration (bringing the laser guide stars closer) and performing tip/tilt operations at infrared wavelengths using either a natural guide star in the field or the target object itself. With this configuration, the adaptive optics facility aims to deliver a diffraction-limited image with a Strehl ratio of 5% (goal is 10%) at 0.75 µm.
