The Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) for the ESO/VLT telescope is an important advancement towards creating an ideal instrument. MUSE is developed by a group of six major European institutes. It is an integral-field spectrograph (IFU) that allows wide field coverage, high spatial resolution, medium resolving power, and covers a large range of wavelengths at the same time. Integral-field spectroscopy is now commonly used in modern telescopes, but most current spectrographs have a limited field of view intended for detailed studies of individual objects. Some multi-IFUs, like the VLT's Giraffe, can capture data from multiple objects at once, increasing their efficiency without changing the general three-step process of imaging, selection, and spectrography. MUSE operates in three modes: a wide-field mode with and without adaptive optics, and a narrow-field mode with improved spatial resolution. The parameters for observation are listed in Table 1. The total amount of data is created by multiplying the number of spaxels (90,000) by the number of spectral pixels (4000), resulting in 360 million elements in total. Having so many pixels is impractical for a single optical device and detector; thus, MUSE consists of 24 identical modules, each made up of a slicer, spectrograph, and a 4k detector. A series of optics rotates and divides the field of view into 24 subfields. These are positioned on the Nasmyth platform, situated between the VLT's focal plane and the IFU modules. Ideal correction is carried out by a deformable mirror on the VLT, using four laser guide stars, along with a natural star for adjusting the position. All guide stars are situated outside the main scientific field of view to reduce extra light interference. The only additional optics within the scientific area is a specialized Na notch filter, minimizing transmission loss compared to traditional adaptive optics systems. This advanced adaptive system is part of the overall VLT facility, with MUSE's specific part called GALACSI. The narrow-field mode of MUSE employs a special optical system to adjust the spatial sampling from 0.2 arcsec to 0.025 arcsec, effectively reducing the view to 7.5 × 7.5 arcsec. The most significant difference lies in adaptive optics coordination (with guide stars located closer) and the tip/tilt, which occurs at infrared wavelengths using either a natural guide star in the view area or the object itself. In such a setup, the adaptive optics are expected to produce an image limited by diffraction, with a Strehl ratio of 5% (targeting 10%) at 0.75 µm.
