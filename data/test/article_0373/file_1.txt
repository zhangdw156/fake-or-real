The VLTI telescope's beams first pass through an injection/optical path delay unit (IOPDU), where a dichroic mirror directs H-band light for further processing. K-band light goes to the VLTI infrared image sensor (IRIS) guiding camera for processing.  This functionality can be reversed in the future with planned modifications. 

Following the IOPDU, various elements handle beam direction and control:
* A flat mirror on a stage allows for precise movement.
* A piezo tip-tilt mirror responds to IRIS data for adjusting light paths.
* A shutter is used to block unwanted light.
* A birefringence compensation plate corrects for optical distortions.
* An off-axis parabola channels the beam into an optical fiber.

Additional elements, not on the signal path, help with alignment or spectral calibration.

An integrated optics beam combiner then takes four input signals and outputs 12 (with variants reaching up to 24) representing baselines across two phases (a+b and a-b). These outputs are relayed by 1:1 relay optics onto the detector. Additional components like a dispersing prism or Wollaston polarisation separator can also be integrated.  

Using two prisms, H-band light can disperse over 7 pixels for high spectral resolution (R ~ 40) or 3 pixels for lower resolution (R ~ 20). Finally, the detector is a Rockwell PICNIC with a commercial liquid nitrogen cryostat, kindly on loan from JPL. The signal is amplified and converted to a digital format before being recorded by the detector control system (DCS).
