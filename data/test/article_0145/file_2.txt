VANDSels's importance lies in its ability to provide detailed information about distant objects using powerful telescopes like Hubble Space Telescope or James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This data can help us understand how stars form early on after big bangs happened billions years ago . The study offers crucial insights into galaxy evolution , particularly their metal content , gas consumption rates ,and how they form stars over time . It's also valuable because it allows astronomers to compare different types of objects within distant galaxy populations like those found within certain regions called "starburst" or "quasar" environments .
