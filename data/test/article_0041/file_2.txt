The ESO Diffuse Interstellar Band Large Exploration Survey (EDIBLES) uses powerful telescopes to study thousands of stars across different types, aiming to create detailed maps showing how different regions within space interact with starlight differently due to their composition or environment. This project focuses heavily on "diffuse interstellar bands" which are mysterious absorption lines in starlight that scientists believe hold clues about what materials exist within space around us but haven't been identified yet; by studying those lines through its high quality data collection process, EDIBLES can help pinpoint what creates them, guiding future research into their origins for both our own galaxy as well as others further out in space.
