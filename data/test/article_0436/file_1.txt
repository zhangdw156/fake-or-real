This report describes a workshop that brought together scientists specializing in laboratory physics, chemistry, and astronomy to discuss how best to develop shared methods for processing data and models related to the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). 

ALMA will offer incredibly detailed information about space thanks to its ability to study sub-millimeter wavelengths. This data will enable astronomers to more precisely test astronomical models of astrochemistry, star and planet formation, galaxy formation, and evolution. However, for the full potential of ALMA's capabilities to be realized, the models themselves must also match this high quality in detail.  

To facilitate comparisons between these models and observations, new and efficient methods for displaying them are urgently needed alongside readily accessible fundamental physical data such as molecular and atomic line frequencies. While the creation of the models is a science activity, adapting these models to interact with ALMA data, making them widely available to scientists in the community is essential to ensure that the results are easily utilized.

For optimal scientific output from ALMA, there is an urgent need for both ancillary data to be readily available and scientific models developed and shared within the wider astronomical community.  Although efforts exist towards this goal, like the Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy (CDMS) and the JPL Splatalogue, their ease of use could be improved. Furthermore, there's a growing concern about the long-term support for the laboratory and theoretical efforts creating the fundamental physical and chemical data needed by astrophysical models. The workshop "Data Needs for ALMA" brought together scientists specializing in these disciplines to discuss how best to develop shared methods for processing data and models related to ALMA. The goal was to identify the specific needs of each stakeholder group, focusing on the creation of new resources like databases of physical data and accessible scientific models to help maximize the potential of this powerful instrument.
