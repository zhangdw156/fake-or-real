We successfully reapplied for observing time in Period 75, allowing us another opportunity, this time in Service Mode. We studied various stars in NGC 6397, from the turnoff to the red-giant branch. In each observing block, two UVES fibres were allocated to two stars in the middle of the subgiant branch, with one fibre monitoring the sky background. We observed five turnoff stars for a total of 12 hours, while six red-giant branch stars required only 1.5 hours to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 100. With a total integration time of 18 hours, the two subgiant branch stars achieved the highest S/N. All 130 fibres to GIRAFFE were filled with stars along the subgiant branch. After obtaining the data, we began analysis, starting with the effective temperatures of the turnoff stars. At this early stage, our preliminary analysis indicated we were on the right track. The complete spectroscopic analysis of the 18 FLAMES-UVES targets took several months. We only obtained meaningful results after accurately correcting for the sky background and the fibre-to-fibre throughput. By November 2005, the spectroscopic results were ready, and we asked Olivier Richard to compute diffusion models that included radiative accelerations and turbulent mixing to compare with our derived abundances. The main factors that affected our findings were the overall size of metal diffusion (in terms of iron) and the behavior of calcium, which limited our understanding of the unknown strength of turbulent mixing. The analysis utilized traditional 1D models, but we employed detailed line formation for iron and calcium. We also assessed the impact of using hydrodynamic model atmospheres and found similar results for weak lines. The main challenge was determining a realistic effective-temperature difference between the turnoff and red-giant branch stars, as most spectral lines originate from neutral species that are highly sensitive to temperature. Moreover, the surface-gravity difference is well established by the apparent-magnitude difference of stars at a certain distance. For our spectroscopic analysis, we used H-alpha, which indicated an effective-temperature difference of 114 K between the turnoff and red-giant branch stars. This value closely aligns with the photometric estimate based on the Strömgren index (v−y), which suggests 1108 K. The differences in surface gravity also matched well, with the spectroscopic value being 0.05 dex smaller than the photometric one. This strong agreement between two independent methods reinforced our confidence in determining relative abundance differences with high accuracy.
