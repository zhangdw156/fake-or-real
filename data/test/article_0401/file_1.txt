Airglow is a faint glow that can sometimes be seen with the naked eye as an unexpected structure against the background stars.  The colors of airglow are invisible to the human eye but can be seen clearly through photographs. It might appear as a subtle tint on the horizon, or it may appear in changing shapes and hues. The green layer of airglow is located about 100 kilometers above the ground and can be easily observed from the International Space Station. A fainter reddish layer of glow also exists at higher altitudes, between 150 to 350 kilometers.  Both layers are linked to atomic oxygen but their different heights cause the green emission to peak closer to the horizon. Airglow's intensity depends on factors like time and location. The red glow is often strongest at night's start, but can fade after midnight. Despite this, bursts of airglow emission may occur at any time. Occasionally, airglow displays as a result of gravity waves â€“  these are oscillating pressure patterns that form in the lower atmosphere due to moving air masses over mountains and then travel to higher altitudes. These waves contribute to intensity changes and cause ripples or patterns within the glow itself.
