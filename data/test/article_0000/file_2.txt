Since its launch on Paranal observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT), FORSC instrument remains highly sought after by astronomers worldwide due to its impressive capabilities for capturing light from distant objects like planets outside our solar system (exoplanets) or other celestial phenomena such as black holes or supernovae explosions .
FORSC has produced a significant amount scientific findings across various fields thanks to its ability to capture ultraviolet light: It boasts over a thousand peer-reviewed articles published using it since its inception , highlighting discoveries like a newly discovered interstellar asteroid within our solar system or identifying gravitational waves generated by merging neutron stars .
Furthermore ,FORSC played a key role contributing significantly towards groundbreaking research published by top scientific journals such as "Nature" including three notable discoveries about interstellar asteroids , gravitational waves sources ,and titanium oxide present within an exoplanets atmosphere . This instrument's impact extends beyond just publishing new findings but also influences how scientists understand their research field through citations from other scientists who have built upon their work .
