Transit of Venus by the Sun is a significant astronomical event. In 1627, Johannes Kepler predicted such an event in 1631, but died before it occurred. Pierre Gassendi was unable to observe the transit because it wasn't visible from Europe. Jeremiah Horrocks realized that transits happen in pairs separated by eight years and successfully observed one in 1639. Since then, only six other such events have happened.  Sir Edmund Halley suggested using these transits to calculate the distance of the Sun, known as an astronomical unit. Expeditions were launched to remote locations and a value for the astronomical unit was obtained through Halley's method. In June 2012, using a mirror on the Moon, scientists detected the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect due to Venus blocking sunlight, providing precise measurements in centimeters per second. This phenomenon is called an occultation. It occurs when a body moves across the front of a star, distorting the star's light patterns. It was first observed in binary systems by McLaughlin and Rossiter. The Rossiter–McLaughlin effect has been detected in almost 100 exoplanets since then, giving important details about their orbital shape and showing that many have tilted orbits. Observing Venus' transit using the Moon demonstrated this effect can be measured even for small planets, suggesting similar transits can also be observed within our Solar System thanks to reflected sunlight. The observation of the Venus transit through the Moon implies other transits are possible in the Solar System as well, since these events happen whenever planets align near a particular point in their orbit. The inner planet Mercury is an exception; it's rarely affected by this phenomenon, however, scientists have predicted that the Earth will pass across the Sun from Mars in 2084 and from Jupiter on January 5th, 2014, with another occurrence scheduled for 2026.
