Space exploration keeps us captivated by incredible milestones! We've not only had to celebrate the anniversaries of the ISS crew but also their daring expedition across celestial bodies like the Moon and Mars.

Think about the momentous occasions when Venus or Mercury have passed in front of the sun – a spectacle that shook astronomers' world back centuries ago. Johannes Kepler, an ingenious mind from 1627, anticipated a transit of Venus way back then, but alas, he died before witnessing it himself. Pierre Gassendi, another pioneering astronomer, missed this extraordinary event because the view was blocked by Europe. Yet, Jeremiah Horrocks, a true visionary, cracked the code and observed the transit in 1639, proving that eight-year cycles are key to unlocking these celestial mysteries!

Fast forward through history. Sir Edmund Halley's brilliance ignited a quest to utilize Venus' transit for measuring distances, culminating in a revolutionary leap forward -  the 'Hailey's method.' Our pursuit of this goal continued on a global scale and has led us to an epochal moment. On June 6th, 2012, a feat of modern science enabled us to use the Moon's reflection for precise observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect during Venus' transit, revealing a remarkable detail with the precision of centimeters per second!

But what about those distant worlds beyond our own?  The phenomenon, initially observed in eclipsing binary systems by McLaughlin and Rossiter, was later confirmed by an astounding 100 exoplanets! This tells us that these planets, while orbiting other stars, have highly tilted orbits. The Venus transit's success in detecting the RM effect even in tiny exoplanet-sized bodies paved the way for a paradigm shift – we could study them through reflected sunlight!

And what about those future events? We know from past observations, and detailed scientific calculations, that Earth will be seen transiting the Sun from Mars in 2084 and from Jupiter on January 5th, 2014! It's going to happen again in 2026, too. These cosmic moments, when planets line up perfectly and our telescopes are poised for action, are truly a testament to the spirit of human curiosity and scientific innovation.
