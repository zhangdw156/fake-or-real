Our journey began with a fascinating look at the cutting-edge technologies designed for Earth-like planet detection. We discovered that the European Large Telescope (ELT) won't be searching for planets using methods like astrometry, microlensing, or photometric transits—those are great tools we’ll definitely use for follow-up, but not the primary focus. Instead, our gaze will primarily land on radial velocity and direct imaging techniques, with hopes to study their atmospheres as well. 

However, it wasn't all smooth sailing.  Wednesday’s sessions explored the challenges these methods face when probing for other planets, particularly those posed by stellar phenomena like intrinsic variability or even the existence of multiple planets in close proximity—both are tricky obstacles for detection.  Despite these hurdles, we’ve come to a consensus:  detecting Earth-sized planets within habitable zones around solar-type stars (spectral types G, K, and M) will be achievable.   M dwarfs in particular promise good results for transit searches; but new generations of powerful spectrographs are poised to uncover “exo-Earths” orbiting closer-than-expected K and M dwarfs. 

Thursday took a deep dive into the exciting prospects of directly detecting Earth-like planets using the ELT.  It's going to be tough, but we’re exploring promising advanced adaptive optics (AO) technologies that could provide us with direct images of those orbiting other solar-type stars. We’ve got our eyes on some great breakthroughs!
