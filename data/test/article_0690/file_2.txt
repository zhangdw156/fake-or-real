The second session began with a presentation about the Extremely Large Telescope's (ELT) capabilities for searching for Earth-like planets and characterizing their properties. It was explained that the ELT's primary focus would not involve directly finding planets using astrometry, microlensing, or photometric transit techniques; however, follow-up studies utilizing these methods are expected.  Significant potential exists through radial velocity and direct imaging techniques, even in characterization of atmospheric conditions on these planets.  The Wednesday sessions delved into the technical and astrophysical constraints surrounding planet detection using these methods. Both instrumental advancements and astrophysical considerations are driving significant progress. While stellar intrinsic phenomena and multi-planet systems pose challenges to detecting other Earth-like planets, a consensus exists that such planets can be detected in the habitable zones of our Sun's type stars (G, K, and M). Smaller red dwarfs might be particularly suitable for transit searches, and new generations of stable spectrographs will enable discoveries of exoplanets around yellow dwarfs. Thursday was primarily focused on discussing challenges and advances made towards directly detecting Earth-like planets using the ELT. Despite its inherent difficulty, several promising extreme adaptive optics (AO) instruments are being planned to provide direct images of planetary systems orbiting other stars similar to our sun.
