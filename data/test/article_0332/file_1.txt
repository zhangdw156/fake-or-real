Since Phase II systems were already updated to handle astronomical surveys like VISTA VST back when they were launched or shortly after their launch between years of 'ten' they needed updating again because they weren't powerful enough later on as other instruments came online like ESPRESSO which requires more computing power than what existed previously . The old program "P" used a desktop app called "P" but it has been replaced by a newer API based one called "P" . Now users can create objects ("OB") directly into a shared repository instead of using an older method where data had to be manually copied over . This makes things easier because data can now automatically update across different locations such as Garching where data is stored at present as well as Paranal , which houses other telescopes used during astronomical observations . The whole project took several years but it involved several key steps such as deploying tools specifically designed for visitors who use these telescopes , then rolling out updates across all telescope units at Paranal over time starting from 'ten'. More advanced features are planned including better integration with existing systems like those used at La Silla , so that astronomers can work even more efficiently going forward . Finally once everything has been fully integrated these old programs no longer need exist since everything is now part of this newer system!
