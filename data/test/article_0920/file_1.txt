The key feature of the VIMOS spectrograph is its high level of multiplexing, which was designed to significantly speed up spectroscopic surveys. However, the VIMOS CCDs, which were installed when the instrument was first set up, are older E2V detectors from the early 2000s and show significant fringing issues beyond about 800 nm. Without the right corrections, the spectra produced with VIMOS’s red grisms (like LR_red, MR, HR_orange, and HR_red) are challenging to use for faint extragalactic sources past this wavelength. To effectively use the full wavelength range of these grisms (up to around 950 nm) and enhance the coverage for redshift surveys, fringing effects must be addressed. Therefore, data from the two main surveys conducted with VIMOS in multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode—the VLT VIMOS Deep Survey and the zCOSMOS survey, along with many smaller VIMOS projects—have been collected using a jitter mode. In this method, each pointing is divided into shorter exposures, and the telescope is slightly shifted (usually by 1 or 2 arcseconds) after each exposure to keep objects within the MOS mask slits. These offsets cause the object spectra to fall on different CCD pixels across different exposures, allowing for a more accurate reconstruction of the fringing pattern by combining all the exposures. However, this technique reduces multiplexing capabilities for MOS observations. To ensure that target objects remain visible in the slits after offsets, the slits need to be longer than necessary, resulting in a larger sky region specified in the VIMOS mask preparation software. When using the stare mode, slits are typically 6 arcseconds long, accounting for a faint object size of 2 arcseconds and an adjacent 2 arcseconds for accurate sky subtraction. In jitter mode, with a pattern of five jitter positions (as used in VVDS and zCOSMOS), slits must be 10 to 12 arcseconds long to include an additional 2 to 3 arcseconds on each side of the object. This increase in slit length roughly doubles the typical length, leading to a 50% reduction in VIMOS multiplexing, as observed in both the VVDS and zCOSMOS projects.
