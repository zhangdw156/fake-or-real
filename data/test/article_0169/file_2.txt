GEBURTS's goal is high precision measurements (within a few kilometers per second) for how fast each star moves away or towards us based on its "magic trick" magic trick: its movement through space as viewed by earthlings! To match this precision with what' gereken data from other observatories looking at these same objects like our own sun... They want these measurements accurate enough so that they can tell us things like how much "stuff" those celestial bodies hold inside them - their age and even if its made up mostly iron! To do this they need information about those 'ingredients', where magic happens - near enough perfect answers about their structure are needed; not just an estimated value but one thats close enough so you know what you got! Then there's another big task – identifying all kinds oif different types off star tracks out there - and doing it really well enough so you dont make mistakes when pulling out useful data.. That takes skill too since some parts are pretty hard because those objects aren't quite as bright... Still though – Its an exciting project aimed at getting us closer than ever before!!
Let me know if I need further assistance on these topics...
