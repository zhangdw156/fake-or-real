The goal is precise measurements:
Radial velocities: The project strives for an accuracy within 2 kms when determining how fast each star moves towards or away from us â€“ aiming this precision level matches existing data on star movements obtained by other telescopes like Gaia (which observes nearby galaxies). This high accuracy applies specifically when analyzing individual bright star's movement within our target galaxies - like those found in The Magellanic Clouds where Gaia can achieve even higher accuracy due its unique capabilities compared traditional methods used by astronomers today!
Metallicity: Accurately determining each star's chemical makeup (metallicity) requires achieving an error less than .2dex - essentially ensuring precision measures against possible variations based on specific elements present within these stellar objects; these calculations rely heavily upon iron line analysis alongside calcium II magnesium b triplet measurements which aid astronomers understand how much heavier elements might contribute towards overall composition!
This information allows us understand what makes up these celestial objects through detailed analysis - especially important since theres a wide range across different types found within The Magellanic Clouds ranging from roughly half as much heavy element content as our Sun all through very low levels detected in some cases called "very metal poor" classified as having D[FeH] greater than two times less heavy element content compared our Sun!
Furthermore:
Variable Stars: Their changing temperatures during pulsation cycles require observing them before significant shifts occur so accurate elemental abundances can be determined; hence observations last around one hour at each point during observation period allowing sufficient signal strength needed!
RR Lyrae Stars: Due their faintness they pose challenges but astronomers plan use their movement patterns instead; however they may combine data across multiple fainter objects sharing comparable metals content measured through Fourier decomposition techniques applied toward light curves analyzed over time!.
