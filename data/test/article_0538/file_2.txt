VIPERS was designed to address a gap in redshift surveys. By utilizing VIMOS's unique capabilities, this project began in Period 82 with the goal of measuring redshifts for approximately 105 galaxies located between 0.5 and 1.2 times the rate at which the universe's expansion is occurring. The survey aimed to accurately measure galaxy clustering and structure formation at a time when the universe was about half its present age, as well as gain insights into galaxy properties. The galaxy target sample for VIPERS comes from data gathered by the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey Wide (CFHTLS–Wide1). To achieve these goals, VIPERS covers approximately 24 square degrees, using a mosaic of 288 VIMOS pointings distributed over two regions within the W1 and W4 CFHTLS fields (192 and 96 pointings respectively), for a total of 45 minutes per VIMOS pointing. It utilizes a combination of observations across 372 hours of multi-object spectrograph (MOS) and pre-imaging that cover 5 x 10^7 h to the power of -3 Mpc cubed, a comparable volume to the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey at a redshift of approximately 0.  This survey is unique among redshift surveys with a sample selection based on galaxy magnitude and color (iAB < 22.5 mag, z > 0.5), allowing for high sampling rates of over 40 percent through a strategy involving short-slit telescopes. The VIMOS low-resolution red grism (spectral resolution R = 210) provides an analysis range between 5500 to 9500 angstroms with a typical redshift root mean square (rms) error of sigma z = 0.00047 multiplied by (1 plus z). Further details about the survey construction and sample properties can be found in Guzzo et al. (2013).
