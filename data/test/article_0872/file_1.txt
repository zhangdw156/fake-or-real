Alongside the building of a large 64-antenna correlator, two smaller models have been created. One model is for the ALMA Test Facility, featuring two prototype antennas at the NRAO VLA site, and the other is for the ALMA Operations Support Facility at a height of 3000 meters. The first smaller model was relocated to the ATF site in 2007 and was used until the end of 2008. The first successful end-to-end operation was achieved in January 2008, targeting the Orion Nebula and detecting many spectral lines at expected frequencies. The second two-antenna correlator was set up at the OSF in 2008 to test production antennas and related equipment prior to their movement to the AOS. The first section of the 64-antenna correlator has been shipped to Chile, installed in the AOS technical building, and was commissioned successfully during the summer of 2008. The airflow from the floor to the top of the station racks, as well as the temperature across the bins and racks, is managed remotely. The room for the 64-antenna correlator is next to the antenna “patch panel” room, allowing a physical link between the fiber outputs of each antenna pad and the correlator inputs. The patch panel accommodates connections to approximately 200 antenna pads for all moveable antennas (50 plus 16 antennas), enabling the ACA antenna data to be processed in the main ALMA correlator. Combining all 50 antennas from the main array with 14 of the ACA antennas in the 64-antenna correlator yields the highest ALMA sensitivity. This setup can increase sensitivity for compact sources by around 8% compared to using the main array alone, and calibration sessions are completed more quickly. The ACA's 16-antenna correlator has also been installed at the higher site. Using two different correlators to process the same data from up to 16 antennas is beneficial for advanced comparisons of these similar machines (with the key difference being that the ACA correlator works with 16 instead of 64 antennas). The Japanese FX-type correlator performs spectral averaging after the F-part and directly computes correlation with 4 bits, but these specifics will not be noticeable to the astronomers; only a minor difference in spectral resolution will exist.
