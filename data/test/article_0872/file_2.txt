Alongside the building of the large 64-antenna correlator, two smaller models have been created. One model is for the ALMA Test Facility, featuring two prototype antennas at the NRAO VLA site, and the other is for the ALMA Operations Support Facility at a height of 3000 meters. The first smaller model was relocated to the ATF site in 2007 and was used until the end of 2008. The first successful end-to-end operation was achieved in January 2008, targeting the Orion Nebula and detecting many spectral lines at expected frequencies. The second two-antenna correlator was set up at the OSF in 2008 to test production antennas and related equipment before they are sent to the AOS. The first section of the 64-antenna correlator has been shipped to Chile, installed in the AOS technical building, and was commissioned successfully in the summer of 2008. The airflow from the floor to the top of the station racks and the temperature in the bins and racks are remotely controlled. The room for the 64-antenna correlator is located next to the antenna patch panel room, allowing the fiber outputs from each antenna pad to connect directly to the correlator inputs. The patch panel is capable of connecting to around 200 antenna pads for all 50+16 moveable antennas and processes data from the ACA antennas in the ALMA baseline correlator. When all 50 antennas from the main array are combined with 14 of the 16 ACA antennas in the 64-antenna correlator, the maximum sensitivity of ALMA is achieved. Sensitivity for compact sources may improve by about 8% compared to using the main array alone, and all calibration sessions are completed more quickly. The 16-antenna ACA correlator has also been set up at the high site. Analyzing the same data (up to 16 antennas) in two different correlators is useful for comparing the two large machines, which have similar specifications (the ACA correlator processes 16 antennas instead of 64). In the Japanese FX-type correlator, spectral averaging occurs after the F-part, and correlation is performed directly in 4 bits, but these details should be unnoticed by astronomers; only the effective spectral resolution will vary slightly.
