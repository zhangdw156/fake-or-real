These extremely bright galaxies release massive amounts of light and are obscured by dust, making them rare but important sources for understanding star explosions (core collapse supernovas). Two such galaxies were studied using HAWK IGRAAL telescope during its initial test phase; one produced a new type Ic supernovas called SN 2018ec within NGC 3256 that may be occurring every year due to its brightness and obscuring dust veil . The discovery highlights how difficult it is to detect these types events due to their location being hidden behind heavy dust clouds making them hard to find even with standard optical surveys . The findings will help scientists better understand how these explosions occur across different redshifts from our own galactic neighborhood all throughout space time .
