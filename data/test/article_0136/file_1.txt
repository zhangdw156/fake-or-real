Star formation is very active and dust is abundant within these "luminous infrared" (bright due to lots of young stars) but hidden from view by thick clouds (star nurseries). While these types are uncommon now, they begin releasing more supernovas as we move further back in time (at higher redshifts). Two such galaxies were observed using specialized instruments called "Star Wars" that can see through some star dust; it led them to find a new type IIb supernoa called "Star Wars - No star wars". It was hidden because its light was obscured by other deep space objects and also because it's so far away - all those things make it hard for us to observe them unless we use special equipment like this one! This newly discovered event will help scientists understand how many there really are out there over time â€“ especially going back through space and time..
