Reaching sub-percent accuracy in sky subtraction still requires addressing variations between fibers when observing light. To achieve this, the team requested time on the FLAMES–GIRAFFE instrument at VLT/UT2 to test the capabilities of their multi-object fiber-fed configuration. These tests showed accuracies within a few tenths of a percent can be achieved using a specific observation sequence (cross beam-switching).  This document describes the observations conducted and resulting findings from this experiment. On March 8th, 2012, technical observations were taken using the Medusa mode with clear sky conditions and a seeing of ~0.9 arcseconds. The target field was observed in the zCOSMOS area over a region of roughly 20 by 20 arcminutes. Seventy fibers were distributed as pairs, separated by 12 arcseconds, with three pairs assigned to "sky" for observing no object. Preliminary findings from these skies will be described.  The LR8 GIRAFFE setup, which covers the wavelengths in the near-infrared spectrum (NIR) with a resolution of R = 6500, was used to acquire spectra for this experiment. Observations were done at low airmass (<1.2) and close to the meridian, minimizing Moon’s influence on the sky background.  The Moon's position during the observation was ~28 degrees away from the target field, contributing about 50% of the total sky background flux in the observation. The observed sky continuum resulted in a magnitude of ~19.7 mag arcsecond-2, which is comparable to J-band sky brightness under dark conditions and suitable for sky subtraction. A cross beam-switching configuration was implemented, with the telescope offsetting 12 arcseconds three times consecutively (A-B-A-B-A-B).  FLAMES does not have a template for this specific setting, so the telescope's guiding system was turned off during the dithered B exposures. The pointing error from offsets in principle is better than 0.2 arcseconds, but was determined to be more cautious as to ensure proper alignment between objects and fiber optics (1.2 arcseconds)  An A-B-A-B sequence was preferred instead of a standard A-B-B-A-sequence for the sake of preserving signal-to-noise ratio in this experiment, thus preventing any potential misalignments between the target object and the fibers during the dithered B exposures. This approach only resulted in increased overhead time compared to typical sequences but maintained consistent signal quality. Each individual exposure was ten minutes.  Three consecutive A-B sequences were obtained to provide a total effective exposure time of one hour before acquiring flat-field exposures for analysis.
