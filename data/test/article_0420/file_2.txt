Most large astronomical telescopes, including the Very Large Telescope (VLT), the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA), and the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), utilize instruments that produce datasets with three dimensions: space, wavelength or frequency.  To efficiently view and analyze these massive datasets, a tool was developed to visualize 3D data using astronomy software platforms like ALMA's CASA package. This tool uses ALMA's existing visualization software for ease of development and long-term maintenance. This new tool helps astronomers working with the VLT dataset by providing a simplified way to view and analyze the complex, three-dimensional data from these telescopes.
