Charles Wilson predicted the existence of transient luminous events (TLEs) in 1920. He invented a device for observing elementary particles and was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1927 for his work. Unfortunately, he did not live to see these events confirmed experimentally. Since 1989, interest in TLEs has grown significantly.  Scientists have detected them using auroral cameras, images from NASA Space Shuttles and International Space Stations, and even captured red sprites on cameras taken by astronauts aboard the ISS.  These events typically occur shortly after lightning strikes, appearing as red flashes. The observation of these events has led to further discoveries, such as gamma bursts originating above thunderstorms.
