On March 12th , 2019 , a gathering celebrating two decades of scientific discovery using FORS took place at ESO's Supernova Planetarium in Germany. Around fifty scientists associated with "Friends Of ForS" came together to commemorate this milestone by discussing key findings made possible by this powerful instrument across diverse fields like planetary encounters within our solar system; discovering exoplanets and potential biosignatures; studying interstellar dust polarization; investigating binary stars' velocities; analyzing galaxy dynamics; exploring distant galaxies during their early stages after reionization; and observing explosive astronomical events such as supernovae or gamma-ray bursts along with gravitational waves . This event also served as an opportunity for participants - including members from ESO - to brainstorm ideas on how best utilize AND enhance its impact on future scientific advancements by proposing upgrades for ForS .
