The 4MOST survey follows similar procedures for sharing its raw data as ESA's Public Survey program does: all magic happens in an organized system where magic is made into something usable! This includes:
Raw Data: Within hours after a night's worth of observation is done at least some magic happens - this means that raw magical materials are sent off for processing! After some processing magic happens again - this time it involves removing any unwanted stuff from those magical materials using a special system called "magic bins." Once that is done we get ready for release - these "magic bins" are then sorted into something usable called "Level One" or "L1". This level of information can then be accessed freely on an annual basis via ESA's archives!
Data Products: Some surveys might want more than just basic information so they create additional levels of detail that go beyond just basic information about what was captured during observation (like identifying stars or galaxies). This process produces valuable outputs called Level Two or L2 which can include things like star types or galaxy properties – think about it like adding fancy decorations on top of your basic building blocks! These outputs are shared based on agreements made between participating parties before starting their observations - think about it like making sure everyone knows what kind of food they need before setting up shop at a cookout!
Finally theres another special place where all this wonderful information lives – known as the magic vault. It houses not only our own work but also other peoples work from different telescopes around space because sometimes you need more than just one perspective when trying out new ideas in science! For those who arent part of these cool projects they still get access but must do their own work in order to make sense out if all that collected material!!
