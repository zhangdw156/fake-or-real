The 4MOST Survey follows similar procedures for sharing its results as ESA's Public Survey programs do:
Raw Data: After each night's observation is complete, all raw data is made available in a central database managed by European Southern Observatory (ESO). This includes cleaning steps that remove any unwanted instrument effects from these initial recordings before releasing them publicly later on in a standardized format known as Level 1 (L1). These files are then made public annually via an official site hosted by ESO..
Processed Data: Participating surveys within this project utilize additional processing steps conducted by specific working groups within consortium organizations like those responsible for classifying objects or determining stellar properties such as luminosity class or redshift estimation . These processed datasets are published under designated schedules agreed upon beforehand between participating surveys ESA..
Additional Resources: Both participating non-participating surveys contribute their results into a shared resource called "the World Archive" managed jointly with other telescopes across various observatories around Europe . This repository houses both initial datasets along with supplementary catalogs containing further analyses that go beyond standard processing methods used in these projects..
In summary: while all involved parties share their findings through common platforms like ESAs archives , some individual surveys may need additional effort when it comes to preparing submitting specific outputs related to analysis methods used during processing stages . This ensures transparency throughout scientific collaboration efforts involving multiple telescopes across different countriesorganizations .
