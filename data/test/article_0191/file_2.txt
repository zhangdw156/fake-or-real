The Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), thanks its powerful capabilities allows scientists deep into how many types off stellar populations exist within nearby galaxies like those within our own Local Group . Past research focused on specific regions known for activity or using specific selection criteria leading researchers down narrow paths when studying these vast amounts off stellar populations . For example , Homers work on examining nearby galaxy called Leo p revealed many large amounts off distant large star clusters that were not easily accessible through traditional methods . Scientists are now using Muse observations on two different areas within Leo p one area showing signs near active star formation while another shows signs off less activity This allows them access unique data about how these larger ancient stellar clusters behave under different conditions . This research provides valuable insights into how these ancient stellar clusters evolve over time as they age . Additionally , discovering new types off ancient stellar clusters helps us understand better how they influence surrounding environments , particularly those related too gas production processes at lower levels than previously observed . To further enhance our understanding researchers hope future projects such as HARMONI located at Eoss Extremely Large Telescope can lead toward even more detailed analysis
