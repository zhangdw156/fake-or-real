The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) project began development through an organization called the "CTA Consortium" formed back in early years. This consortium boasts over one thousand three hundred scientists working across two hundred institutes spread across thirty-two countries, all contributing toward designing their own telescope equipment along with supporting software development characterization efforts associated with these projects .
The formal foundation that serves as legal framework came about through an observatory known as "CTA Observatory", located within Heidelberg during the year two thousand fourteen. This provided structure surrounding operations management contracting details concerning this project .
A governing council made up primarily from shareholder members representing various European nations like Austria , Czech Republic , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Spain Switzerland UK along with associate members including Netherlands South Africa oversees all aspects related to this initiative . Funding support has been consistently provided through EU programs such as FP7 HHH while also being recognized within ESFRI's roadmap since early years .
From years two thousand ten through two thousand thirteen, extensive research efforts focused on identifying suitable locations were conducted throughout Europe which resulted into shortlisting potential sites based upon criteria outlined during consultations between stakeholders . Ultimately these efforts led them down specific paths regarding where they would host their main observing platforms - one situated southwards within Chile's Paranal observatory site while another would reside atop La Palma's Roque de los Muchachos Observatory within Canary Islands region . These agreements were finalized via separate contracts signed off between institutions involved during September two thousand sixteen alongside approval given via both councils - specifically those overseeing operations within CAO(Chilean Astronomy Organization)and ESO(European Southern Observatory) respectively which concluded final agreements regarding collaboration between parties involved after their respective approvals were granted!
In addition it has been decided that headquarters location should be set up somewhere near Bologna while data management center would be located nearby Berlin focusing mainly on data processing activities related to observations collected using this new system! Initial estimates suggest building costs could exceed four hundred million Euros but despite any reductions implemented due various factors they are still able to build out state-of-the art facilities capable enoughto acquire high quality astronomical data which can only enhance existing knowledge base about our universe! So far substantial progress has been made exceeding twenty million Euros already allocated toward construction preparations but reaching required funding level remains ongoing process expected soon enough!
