The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) project began development through an organization called the "CTA Consortium" formed back in early years. This consortium boasts over one thousand three hundred scientists, engineers working across more than two hundred institutions spread across thirty two countries all contributing toward designing their own telescope equipment along with supporting software development characterization efforts associated with these projects .
The formal foundation that serves as legal framework came about back in [year] when they created "CTA Observatory" based out Heidelberg . This helped establish guidelines surrounding operations contracting related aspects concerning this project .
A governing council made up mostly members representing various nations including Austria , Czech Republic , France ,Germany ,Italy ,Japan ,Spain Switzerland United Kingdom alongwith associates members like Netherlands South Africa make up this council which oversees all decisions made regarding this project .
The EU has been instrumental throughout this journey providing support via programs like FP7 H2020 since [year]. Additionally since early years it has been included within ESFRI's roadmap which outlines priorities within research infrastructure initiatives .
Extensive site selection process took place between [year] - [year] where they narrowed down potential locations before submitting recommendations to an independent committee called "Resource Board". Their final decision came down after selecting Paranal site located Chile's western coast alongside Roque de los Muchachos observatory located on La Palma island off Canary Islands.. Both agreements were finalized during [Year]
In addition there are plans underway involving setting up headquarters based out Bologna while also establishing data management center near Berlin Germany where it can house data storage systems etc., making sure vital information can be easily accessed when needed
It's estimated that building everything required would cost around 4 billion but despite having fewer telescopes they still plan on creating an advanced astronomical facility capable enough to support cutting edge research work . Currently [amount] have been secured through collaborations agreements already signed indicating progress toward reaching their goal
