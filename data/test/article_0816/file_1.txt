Institutional testing of the 'AO system,' similar to traditional systems, isn't feasible without either a telescope or an advanced facility that can replicate the optical and mechanical interfaces. In this scenario, an added challenge is testing a large convex optical element. The Test Facility outlined below is itself complicatively expensive; for example, it requires a 1.65 m concave mirror. Nevertheless, investing in a comprehensive and adaptable testing facility is beneficial for characterizing and understanding these systems. It will enable the design team to build confidence and gain critical experience with the adaptive optics systems before putting everything together and integrating it with the telescope. Ultimately, this will conserve precious telescope time by reducing the commissioning period. This facility will facilitate testing of the DSM and also offer a turbulence generator to replicate atmospheric conditions for AO corrections, as well as VLT standard opto-mechanical interfaces for the AO components GRAAL and GALACSI used with instruments like Hawk-I and MUSE. As depicted in Figure 3, the opto-mechanical setup includes two mirrors and the VLT DSM, which is mounted on a vertical framework supporting the M2 unit. This arrangement mimics the configuration found in the VLT, where the gravity direction aligns with the M2 optical axis. Two additional optical parts are needed: a main aspheric mirror with a diameter of 1.65 m and a smaller aspheric mirror measuring 10 mm. The larger aspheric mirror can be finished using conventional polishing, while fabricating the smaller one will require diamond turning. This setup would provide a 2-arcminute field of view without any distortion at the pupil.
