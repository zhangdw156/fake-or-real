Testing the 'AO system' like traditional systems cannot be done fully without a telescope or a complex facility that can replicate the opto-mechanical connections. The challenge is increased by having to test a large curved optical piece. The Test Facility described below is complex and expensive, highlighted by the need for a 1.65 m concave mirror. However, investing in a versatile and comprehensive test facility is essential for understanding these systems. It will help the design team build confidence and experience with the adaptive optics systems before they are put together and integrated into the telescope, ultimately saving telescope time by reducing commissioning time. This facility will enable testing of the DSM and includes a turbulence generator to simulate AO correction under realistic conditions, as well as VLT-standard opto-mechanical interfaces for the AO pre-stages GRAAL and GALACSI for the Hawk-I and MUSE instruments. The opto-mechanical design in Figure 3 includes two mirrors and the VLT DSM, mounted on a vertical structure that supports the M2 unit, mimicking the VLT setup. The gravity vector aligns with the M2 optical axis. Additionally, two optical components are necessary: a main 1.65 m diameter aspheric mirror and a smaller 10 mm diameter aspheric mirror. The first can be polished with standard techniques, while the second requires diamond turning. This arrangement would provide a 2-arcmin field of view without pupil distortion.
