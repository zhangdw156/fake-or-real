Existing research has focused on understanding galaxy-wide ionised outflows in distant galaxies using optical spectroscopy. However, work on high-redshift galaxies (those closer to when the universe began) is scarce because these galaxies emit light mostly in near-infrared wavelengths. While there have been some successful attempts at examining a few individual objects with near-infrared instruments like SINFONI, gathering large sample sizes for detailed analysis has been difficult due to limited instrumentation. Consequently, we lack a comprehensive understanding of AGN (active galactic nuclei) feedback and outflows because these are most active during early epochs. 

The KMOS instrument at the VLT telescope provides a solution by offering 24 near-infrared IFUs with independent motion within a field of view. This enables it to quickly create large samples of high-redshift AGN host galaxies while providing spatially resolved information about their rest-frame optical emission lines. The KMOS AGN Survey at High Redshift (KASHz) project utilizes this instrument for high-quality near-infrared spectroscopic analysis of these galaxies, advancing our understanding of ionised outflows in AGN and the galaxies as a whole.
