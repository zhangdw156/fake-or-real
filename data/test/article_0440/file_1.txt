The world's leading astronomers were invited to weigh in on vital questions impacting space exploration and medicine.  Launched December 19th, 2014 with a deadline of February 18th, 2015, this comprehensive poll sought answers from over 9350 professional astronomers within the ESO User Portal and ALMA Science Portal. The poll aimed to unlock vital insights into the future of astronomy, space medicine, and their interplay.

**What did they say?**  

The survey covered four core areas: **self-identification and interests (I)**; **present and future observing facilities (II)**; **time scheduling and observing modes (III)**; and **data management and services (IV)**. This detailed breakdown provided invaluable data on the aspirations of top astronomers in diverse fields like research focus, wavelength range expertise, and visions for the future of space exploration and scientific advancement.  

**Let's look at the highlights:**

* **Demographic insight**: 1775 complete responses were collected representing a remarkable 20% participation rate! This survey yielded invaluable details about each astronomer's career trajectory, their affiliations, research passions, and expectations for their work in astronomy during the next decade.
* **Future vision**:  Participants shared their perspectives on what facilities, both within and outside of ESO, they believe will shape the future of astronomical exploration. 
* **Impactful data management**: The survey also sought to understand how astronomers are currently managing time and data.  It provided valuable insights into how these vital aspects of research can be further improved in the coming years.

**A look ahead:** These results offer a robust foundation for the future direction of space medicine. We must consider that each survey is unique and offers different perspectives. By carefully interpreting this data, we can gain invaluable insight into the changing landscape of astronomy and its significant impact on life sciences.


**Remember**:  Space medicine continues to advance rapidly, driven by breakthroughs in research and technology that enable us to better understand and treat astronauts in space.   As we look further, it is essential to continually learn and explore.
