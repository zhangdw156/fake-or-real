The next step in our simulation process uses an algorithm called ARTIST CASA task raytrace which calculates how light from an object should appear based on its distance from us and how we're viewing it (like looking at it from different angles). Users get control over things like pixel size (how small each part gets), what area we see (field-of-view), how detailed our analysis will be (spectral resolution), and what specific transitions within molecules we're interested in observing within this light emission pattern . It typically takes about 5 minutes per image file format called "FITS" containing all these calculations together! This output file can then help us compare our simulated results against real data collected by ALMA telescopes or even predict future observations using those telescopes too! Keep in mind that ARTIST doesn't create perfect "source" simulations - some rely on both density AND temperature information while others only work with density alone - so you might need additional tools if you want super precise modeling results! However , ARTIST provides quick access simplified versions so users who just want initial insights into what they might see using ALMA have something useful they can use right away! For much more complex modeling work though , specialized tools like LIME are necessary
