Research on the dark energy equation of state can benefit from four different approaches: analyzing the large-scale structure of galaxy distributions, studying the number of galaxy clusters, utilizing weak gravitational lensing, and examining the distance-redshift relation from distant supernovae. We evaluated the relative strengths of these methods based on a thorough assessment by the USAâ€™s Dark Energy Task Force. Each method requires significant improvements in measurement accuracy to address potential unanticipated systematic limitations. Since this question is crucial, relying on just one method carries an unacceptable risk. The physics of inflation can be explored using three main techniques: directly detecting gravitational waves from the inflation period, measuring the B-mode polarization signal of the cosmic microwave background caused by gravity waves, and precisely assessing the slope and curvature of the density fluctuation power spectrum. These methods are limited by CMB measurements at large scales and weak lensing and Lyman-alpha forest studies at smaller scales. 

Which of these approaches seems feasible for implementation in Europe or with strong European involvement over the next 15 years? This question carries a lot of uncertainty due to factors like funding and international collaborations, especially with partners outside Europe. However, significant effort has gone into planning for future projects, providing a solid foundation to identify the best prospects. There is certainly no lack of ideas, reflecting a vibrant scientific community in European cosmology, though some ideas may exceed feasible funding limits. Given the collaborative nature of this working group, we have focused on timely opportunities for cooperation between two major entities in European astronomy. 

Which of these methods has a wide range of applications and high versatility beyond fundamental cosmology? Since addressing key cosmological questions will require substantial resources, it is advantageous for the projects pursued to yield datasets that are broadly applicable. While cosmological issues primarily drive these projects and dictate their specifications, a diverse range of applications will enhance the scientific value of the investments and increase community support.
