The workshop focused on choosing the best algorithm for a real-time controller to optimize adaptive optics (AO). The AO system's complexity can be determined by factors like degrees of freedom at input and output, as well as sampling rate. This measure defines minimum computing power requirements using a standard least squares reconstructor method, easily implemented through matrix-vector multiplication. However, for systems like EPICS, the high computational demands may make this approach impractical.  Here, smart algorithms come into play. 

There are two main categories of smart algorithms: those that utilize sparse interaction matrices without inverting them and those that rely on system models, sometimes using an interaction matrix to adjust the model. The former uses conjugate gradient descent or its variations to find solutions. In the latter case, the algorithm's performance depends on the specific model used.

The Austrian Adaptive Optics group presented research highlighting novel reconstruction algorithms in a dedicated session at the workshop. These algorithms are undergoing testing and have shown promising results.  Research suggests techniques like single conjugate AO/extreme AO (SCAO), multi-conjugate AO/laser tomography (LTAO), multi-object AO, as well as optimization of the already mature Frim algorithm (for SCAO and MCAO). This algorithm is essentially a pre-conditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method. It leverages the closed-loop nature of the process to reduce iterations from PCG to only one, reducing latency concerns.  A new approach employs splines on triangular partitions for parallel wavefront reconstruction. Another method uses just images captured by the science detector is still in its early stage and faces challenges.

Overall, a wide range of algorithms are currently available to replace traditional matrix-vector multiplication methods, and testing their effectiveness will be crucial in their adoption.
