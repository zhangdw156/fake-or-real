Halftoning for High-contrast Imaging: Developments for the SPHERE and EPICS Instruments  
Controlling light intensity is essential for various scientific fields, including imaging systems, astronomical tools, and laser physics. This summary highlights recent research and development efforts at ESO involving halftoning, a technique that creates a continuous image using dots. Custom filters that vary in light transmission are created using a binary arrangement of metal pixels, allowing precise control of local transmission. We describe applications for an apodiser for the VLT SPHERE instrument and a mask for the E-ELT EPICS project. High-contrast instruments like SPHERE (the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet Research instrument for the VLT) and EPICS (for the upcoming European Extremely Large Telescope) require specialized components with varying transmission. A common example is a stellar coronagraph, which reduces the contrast between a star and its companion. These subsystems aim to manage light transmission in either the pupil plane (through pupil apodisation) or a focal plane (via an occulting mask, a type of low frequency filter). Creating these components with varying transmission is challenging, and various methods have been explored for astronomy, such as metal deposition with different thicknesses or using electron beam lithography on high-energy beam-sensitive glass. We present some findings related to recent advancements in components with varying transmission using a fairly straightforward technique similar to the digital halftoning process used in printing.
