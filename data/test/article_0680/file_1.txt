The final two days of the workshop focused on hands-on instruction with software relevant to ALMA proposal preparation. Roughly eighty participants were divided into two groups based on their previous experience with radio/sub-mm interferometry. Each group received a separate tutorial on two major pieces of software: the Optimal Transport (OT) software and the ALMA simulator. The tutorials for novice users included introductory training on both software and radio/sub-mm concepts. Both groups went through software presentations, live demonstrations, and some hands-on practice time with software provided by tutors, which lasted several hours.  

The workshop was a success with enthusiastic participation from the European astronomical community. This enthusiasm is evident in the lively discussions among participants who look forward to ALMA's upcoming operations and are excited about submitting proposals. The results of the presentations and most of the tutorial materials can be accessed online at the conference website.
