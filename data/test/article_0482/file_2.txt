Our observations using a technique called aperture-synthesis imaging have shown Betelgeuse and Antares' outer atmospheres display vigorous, non-uniform movement of large gas clumps that extend at least 1.3 times the size of our sun. These motions resemble the movement of the hotter chromospheric gases surrounding the stars. The observed complex gas dynamics are distinct from the relatively static, linear acceleration commonly used to model the circumstellar envelopes around these stars. What can be causing this non-uniform velocity field in Betelgeuse and Antares' outer atmospheres? The turbulent movements of large gas clumps could resemble large convective cells. However, the density of the outer atmosphere at 1.2 times the size of our sun is around 10−14 g cm−3, which is more than six orders of magnitude higher than what current simulations for red supergiant stars predict for convection-induced turbulence in their atmospheres. This suggests that while convection likely generates non-uniformities within deep photospheric layers, it is not strong enough to push the atmosphere to the observed 1.3 times the size of our sun.
