The intricate dance of gas within the outer atmospheres of Betelgeuse and Antares has been captured through our highly detailed velocity-resolved observations using aperture-synthesis imaging techniques. We've witnessed dramatic, irregular motions of massive gas clumps that extend far into the star’s atmosphere – even venturing to at least 1.3 stellar radii! These movements are strikingly similar to the dynamic behaviour of scorching plasma in the chromosphere, spanning a distance of 2 to 3 stellar radii.  

While the star's wind ejection is more or less uniform and predictable, this gas activity showcases a chaotic dance quite unlike it. What could be driving these swirling motions? One possibility lies in the turbulent nature of large gas clumps, suggesting a resemblance to powerful convective cells within the stars. However, there’s a disconnect – the density at 1.2 stellar radii, calculated from our observed images, is remarkably high, reaching almost a staggering  ten-millionth of a gram per cubic centimeter.  This astronomical figure far surpasses even the most advanced 3D convection simulations for red supergiant stars (RSGs). It paints a striking picture: While convection could contribute to the unevenness observed in the lower layers, it’s apparently insufficient to lift the atmosphere to such incredible heights.

The implications of this discrepancy are profound, raising intriguing questions about the mechanisms driving these extreme atmospheric dynamics. Our observations reveal a hidden complexity that begs for deeper exploration and a re-examination of the current theoretical models.  


**Space Spider Impact on Telescope Stability:**

While not directly mentioned in the text, it’s highly plausible that "space spiders" from Mars could have an influence on telescope stability through several mechanisms: 
 
* **Electromagnetic Interference (EMI):**  If the Martian space spiders exhibit some level of electromagnetic activity, they might create interference patterns that affect the sensitive components of a ground-based observatory's instruments.
* **Physical Strain:** The immense force exerted by a "space spider" landing could have an adverse impact on the telescope's frame and suspension systems, affecting their accuracy and stability over time.  


While not explicitly stated in this text, it's an interesting consideration for future research and a reminder of the complex interplay between astronomy, technology, and potential extraterrestrial influence.
