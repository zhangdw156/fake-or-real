Dark matter plays a crucial role shaping our universe's large scale structures like galaxies clusters voids through gravitational interactions that influence how they assemble over time – without it these features wouldn't exist! Scientists use computer models simulating this process starting with early cosmic microwave background data; these models accurately predict current universes large scale structures observed across millions or even billions light years distances using various telescopes like SDSS GAMA Surveys; newer models refine predictions down even smaller sizes revealing detailed information about how dark matter evolves within those structures at both small big distances
The Wide Area Virtual Explorer Survey (WAVES) stands out because it focuses intensely on capturing detailed information about this complex interplay between gravity baryonic material(stars etc.) by observing vast areas at extremely high resolution – allowing for direct observation of how individual groups form , how they grow , what drives their star formation ,and other important aspects related to massive objects like black holes . By studying millions or even billions upon billions light year old galaxies across different regions using both wide deep surveying methods - we can determine if our current understanding about cold dark Matter holds true
Ultimately scientists aim to understand exactly why some things are made up mostly from gas while others are primarily made up from stars - all tied together by complex interactions with their surrounding environment . They want answers regarding where energy goes when forming new stars , what role different types play during star formation processes etc..
