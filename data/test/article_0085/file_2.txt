Dark matter plays a crucial role shaping our universe's large scale structures like galaxies clusters voids through gravitational interactions that influence how they assemble over time â€“ without it these features wouldn't exist! Scientists use computer models simulating this process starting with early cosmic microwave background data; these models accurately predict overall universe structures observed at vast distances using various surveys like SDSS GAMA but also reveal finer details down even smaller scales using advanced simulations that account for different masses within those structures
The upcoming "WAVES" project aims for a unique approach: It plans to observe millions upon millions of galaxies across specific regions with unprecedented detail; this allows researchers directly track how clumps form within denser areas due changes caused by gravity interacting with both visible "baryonic" particles invisible "dark" particles - ultimately helping us understand how stars form based on their surrounding environment
This project goes beyond previous research because it focuses specifically on smaller objects like dwarf galaxies or faint ones less studied before; it also maps out how energy flows from star formation into powerful black holes across vast periods spanning billions years - all thanks to studying various sizes densities around each galaxy
