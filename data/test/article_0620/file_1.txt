The debris disc around the star b Pic is the most extensively studied example in this category. These discs are good locations to search for planets because they typically contain brighter planets compared to older stars, and due to these discs' composition. This means there are less limitations on what kind of planet we could be searching for. It is also interesting that some debris discs have unusual structures such as rings or asymmetries.  While it's likely these features were created by planets, other factors may also play a role. The star systems around which planets are imaged show an impressive connection to debris discs: Fomalhaut, HR8799, and b Pictoris. With the development of more advanced instruments that offer higher resolution or sensitivity in their observations, it is possible to discover even more planets around these stars in the future, allowing for a better understanding of how different planetary systems formed.
