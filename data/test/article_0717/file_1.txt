To prepare for a presentation at the IAU General Assembly, we surveyed large observatories to understand the telescope statistics they compile, the frequency of these compilations, and who is responsible for them. All participants regularly gather total and/or average counts of their refereed publications, with most also tracking unrefereed publications, either consistently or upon request. All respondents collect citation statistics for their refereed publications, though only half do so routinely; the other half only collects this data when requested. As expected, observatories gather statistics according to their specific needs, such as publication and citation counts per instrument, program type, observing cycle, and observing mode. Nearly all respondents also look into their high-impact papers. The Space Telescope Science Institute conducts an annual study in April on highly cited papers and how they are distributed among facilities. Each methodology used by observatories has its pros and cons: while counting publications reflects facility productivity, it doesnâ€™t show whether these publications truly advance astronomy. Citation counts indicate impact within the astronomy community but can be skewed by a few highly cited works. Examining high-impact papers and their distribution offers a less biased perspective, but obtaining such data is more complex than simple counting. Several in-depth studies have analyzed the productivity and impact of optical, space-based, and radio telescopes, focusing on papers, citations, and impact factors across facilities to mitigate biases typical to individual observatories.
