To prepare for a presentation at the IAU General Assembly, we surveyed large observatories to gather information on what telescope statistics they compile, how often they compile them, and who is responsible for these tasks. All participants routinely track the total and/or average number of their peer-reviewed publications, and most also track non-peer-reviewed publications either regularly or on request. Everyone collects citation statistics for their peer-reviewed publications, but only half do this routinely; the other half only do it upon request. Observatories compile statistics based on their specific requirements, such as the number of publications and citations by instrument, program type, observing cycle, and observing mode. Nearly all participants also investigate their high-impact papers. Each April, the Space Telescope Science Institute conducts a study of highly cited papers and their distribution among facilities. The methods used by observatories have both benefits and drawbacks: counting publications measures productivity, but does not reflect the publication's impact on astronomical advancements. Examining citation counts gauges community impact, but can be skewed by particularly highly cited papers. Evaluating high-impact papers and their distribution across observatories is less biased, though much more a complicated process than simply counting publications and citations. Several comprehensive studies have examined the productivity and impact of optical, space-based, and radio telescopes and analyzed journal papers, citations, and impact factors by observing their distribution among facilities, freeing the analysis from the bias seen in studies from Single observatories.
