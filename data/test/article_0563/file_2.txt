Astronomers conducted observations of five celestial objects using ALMA's long baseline capabilities to demonstrate its potential for scientific discoveries. The targets included Juno asteroid, Mira AGB star, the circumstellar disc around young star HL Tau, quasar 3C 138 and gravitationally lensed submillimetre galaxy SDP.81. Observations were taken over a range of baselines from approximately 15 meters to 15 kilometers using two or three frequency bands (Bands 3, 4, 6, and 7).  The collected observational data is publicly available on the ALMA Science Portal, and a summary of the findings has been published in several scientific journals.
