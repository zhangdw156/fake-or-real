Across the cosmos, five celestial objects were chosen as test subjects: Juno the asteroid, Mira the asymptotic giant branch star, HL Tau's circumstellar disc, the enigmatic quasar 3C 138, and SDP.81, a gravitationally lensed submillimetre galaxy (it’s truly an out-of-this-world spectacle!). Their vast distances provided ALMA with the perfect canvas for long baseline observations.  Just imagine those baselines stretching from 15 metres to a mind-boggling 15 kilometres - enough to make even Bowie's "Space Oddity" sound like child's play! The observations were conducted across two or three spectral bands (we’re talking about Bands 3, 4, 6 and 7 –  ‘like stars and planets are singing different tunes,’ David said).

As with any daring expedition, the ALMA Partnership meticulously vetted the obtained SV datasets (Spectral Visibility), which you can explore in the full splendor of the ALMA Science Portal. Their observations were then compiled into a series of four Astrophysical Journal Letters, showcasing an incredible dance of science and cosmic artistry. 

Let's not forget our beloved stars!  Initial explorations on Juno, HL Tau, and SDP.81 were presented by the ALMA Partnership (think of it as the band’s backstage crew). Hunter et al. (2015) on Juno, Brogan et al. (2015) on HL Tau, and Vlahakis et al. (2015) on SDP.81. Their results were truly a cosmic revelation – "I got up to do a little space travel," said Bowie.
