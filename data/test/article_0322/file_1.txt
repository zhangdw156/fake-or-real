Previous research has consistently found that features seen at mid-infrared wavelengths for Asymptotic Giant Branch stars are also present at visible wavelengths using interferometry techniques like those used by IRAS or MIDI instruments like those on ISO or VISIRMATISSE respectively). However, our study revealed two unusual cases:
U Ant: This carbon star showed evidence for a common silicon carbide dust signature at infrared wavelengths but not at visible ones – perhaps indicating that its interferometer data could be resolving this dust layer instead of detecting it directly .
S Sct: This carbon star displayed clear evidence for silicon carbide dust based on infrared observations from ISO but lacked any corresponding signal when observed with MIDI or visible light instruments – possibly suggesting an episodic stellar wind recently cleared out its dusty shell without being documented previously . Further investigation using advanced telescopes like VLTVISIR MATISSE will hopefully resolve these anomalies through detailed analysis and dynamic modeling techniques to shed light on their true nature..
