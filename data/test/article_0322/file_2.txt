variegated research on red giant stars has consistently shown that their spectra contain consistent elements across different wavelengths; however this was not found to be true for two specific examples within our study . Specifically:
The presence of crystalline silica dust commonly seen at 11 micron wavelength was observed by both older instruments like IRASMIDI but not present or very faint when examined through an active telescope's capabilities like those used by ground based or space based platforms like LBT(Llewellyn Bankes Trust). This could indicate that these systems are filtering out some level of observation due to their sensitivity levels..
Another case involved Star S Sct which showed evidence for SiC from other instruments like ISO but had no corresponding signal on either standard methods or more sensitive ones after being compared against existing data sets available online through databases maintained by prominent institutions worldwide who specialize on studying celestial objects at various disciplines within astronomy ranging from spectroscopy to imaging techniques employed today including white light imaging techniques popularized by researchers using powerful telescopes around star systems known as "type II" main sequence type binary systems where one component functions as a main sequence while its companion may act as either an M dwarfs or even possibly brown dwarfs depending upon its mass requirements etc...
To uncover these phenomena further investigations are needed using advanced instruments such as VLT(VLT will be completed soon), which could help us understand why these specific cases deviate from established patterns within this field which will provide valuable insights into how they are formedevolved over time what role they play within larger galactic environments surrounding them . This would also require detailed analysis using sophisticated modeling techniques involving various aspects pertaining to stellar atmospheres , stellar winds etc., among others...
