This upgrade focused on installing new octagonal fibers to improve the spatial mode scrambling within these fibers, leading to a much more uniform and stable light distribution at the fiber's exit point.  The primary indicator of success is the instrument's sensitivity to alignment shifts. This sensitivity was previously high;  before the upgrade, there was a radial velocity drift of 3 meters per second when centering the star with a 0.5 arcsecond shift from the fiber center. After the upgrade, this drift can no longer be detected down to the measurement uncertainty. Spectra were acquired for each star position in relation to the fiber center and the standard deviation of these measurements was used to express an uncertainty including stellar jitter. The average radial velocity offset with the star centered is -12 centimeters per second plus or minus 37 centimeters per second (only photon noise, 12 data points); or -12 centimeters per second plus or minus 72 centimeters per second (photon noise and stellar jitter included, 12 data points). Variations in radial velocity were also measured with respect to changes of the telescope focus within a 0.6 millimeter range around its optimal position. In this case, like before, variations remain well within the measurement uncertainty (seeing was about 1 arcsecond). These are the main results achieved by the upgrade. The previous radial velocity precision was limited by the star's centring on the fiber. Even minor adjustments, as small as 0.05 arcseconds, would lead to a variation of approximately 30 centimeters per second in the radial velocity measurement. This variation has been reduced by at least a factor ten and minor de-centering or defocusing events will now have a negligible impact on the radial velocity precision.
