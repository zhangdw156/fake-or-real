Scientists can study how gas and star formation occur in distant galaxies across the full range of electromagnetic radiation. Large telescopes such as the ESO Very Large Telescope and the Keck telescope help us observe emission lines like Lyα, Hα, and Mgii, which are associated with star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity.  Far-infrared (FIR) lines, particularly the [Cii] line at 158 μm,  reveal details about interstellar gas in galaxies. These lines are being studied using surveys like Herschel. As a new tool for studying these distant galaxies is coming online, its use will become more common.  In the millimeter and centimeter wavelengths, molecules like CO, HCN, and HCO+ show us the direct activity of star-forming gas. Observational efforts with telescopes such as the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) and the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope provide information on this in galaxies beyond a redshift of z > 1.4. Current observations are modeled by sophisticated numerical simulations that consider hydrodynamics. The purpose of this workshop was to bring together scientists from Chile and other countries to discuss models and observations related to gas dynamics in galaxies. More than 80 individuals, including many students, attended the conference, which focused on current progress in understanding how gas behaves in galaxies.  With the launch of early ALMA science soon and a deadline for cycle 0 looming as the meeting occurred, future possibilities with the ALMA facility were discussed. The main purpose of the workshop was to discuss the current state of observations and models related to this important area of astronomy.
