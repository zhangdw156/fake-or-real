Figure one shows how hot gas (dust) forms rings around a central hole within galaxy NGC 1068 . These rings are brightest on its southwest edge - suggesting it's facing away from us (the "near" region).
The brightness pattern matches predictions based on how large graphite particles heat up under powerful radiation coming from supermassive black holes found within galaxies like NGC 1237 . A model assuming these particles form part or all this bright region provides further support for this idea - but only if some part or all bright material comes from outside this region rather than directly inside it (as might be expected from traditional disk structures).
This model also explains why there's such strong infrared light coming off this area: It suggests there may be another component beyond just what we see directly associated with supermassive black holes - perhaps even something like gas flowing out into space powered by those same powerful objects!
