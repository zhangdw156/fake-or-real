We have been developing a technique to determine the abundances of stars from other galaxies using near-infrared spectroscopy of red supergiants. These types of stars are very bright (have high luminosity), young, and peak in infrared light, making them suitable for this method.  A challenge is that their spectra contain many absorption lines caused by molecular gas, requiring high resolution to study individual lines, limiting their applicability for extragalactic studies due to the long exposure times. We found a spectral region around 1.2 micrometers (Î¼m) with less molecular absorption. Using moderate spectral resolution (R ~ 3000), we can determine metallicity relative to the Sun ([Z]) from this region. This method is adaptable for analyzing distant galaxies and well-suited for instruments like the K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS) on the Very Large Telescope.  Simulations with the Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) confirmed we can measure [Z] at distances of 75 megaparsecs (Mpc).
