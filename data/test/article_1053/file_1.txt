We calculated the average ages, total metallicities, and total a/Fe enhancements of the stellar populations in the center of the sample bulges using stellar population models based on line-strength indices. These models predict the line-strength index values for a single stellar population in relation to its age, metallicity, and [a/Fe] ratios. We identified three types of bulges based on their age and metallicity. The young bulges average about 2 billion years old and show signs of star formation, evident from the presence of the Hb emission line in their spectra. The intermediate-age bulges range from 4 to 8 billion years and have solar metallicity. The old bulges exhibit high metallicity and their ages cluster around 10 billion years. While the trend is not strongly significant, elliptical and S0 galaxies tend to have bulges that are older and more metal-rich than those in spiral galaxies in the central region. Most of the sample bulges display solar a/Fe enhancements, with the median being [a/Fe] = 0.07 dex. There is a mild correlation between age, velocity dispersion, and a/Fe enhancement. We conclude that the larger bulges in our sample galaxies tend to be older, more metal-rich, and associated with rapid star formation.
