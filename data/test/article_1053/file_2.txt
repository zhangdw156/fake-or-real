Using the central line-strength indices, we calculated the average ages, total metallicities, and total a/Fe enhancements of the stellar populations in the center of the bulges in our sample, based on stellar population models. These models predict the line-strength indices for a single stellar population based on age, metallicity, and [a/Fe] ratios. We identified three categories of bulges based on age and metallicity. The young bulges have an average age of about 2 billion years and show signs of star formation, indicated by the presence of the Hb emission line in their spectra. The intermediate-age bulges are between 4 and 8 billion years old and have solar metallicity. The old bulges have high metallicity and ages clustered around 10 billion years. While the correlations are not very strong statistically, elliptical and S0 galaxies have bulges that are older and more metal-rich than those in spiral galaxies at the center. Most bulges in our sample show solar a/Fe enhancements, with a median value of [a/Fe] = 0.07 dex. There is a mild correlation between age and both velocity dispersion and a/Fe enhancement. We conclude that the more massive bulges in our sample galaxies are older, richer in metals, and characterized by rapid star formation.
