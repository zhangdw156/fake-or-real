Detector Upgrade for FLAMES: GIRAFFE Gets Red Eyes  
In May 2008, a new CCD called Carreras was installed in the GIRAFFE spectrograph to replace the old detector, Bruce. Carreras is more sensitive to light wavelengths longer than 700 nm. This report details the main features and results from the commissioning of Carreras. FLAMES is the multi-object, intermediate and high-resolution fiber facility of the VLT. Located at the Nasmyth A platform of UT2, it provides a large corrected field of view (25 arcminutes in diameter) and includes several fiber modes. Most of FLAMES' fiber modes connect to GIRAFFE, a medium-high resolution spectrograph that covers the entire visible spectrum (370–950 nm). Soon after operations started, we began searching for a new detector for GIRAFFE to improve its red quantum efficiency (QE), while still maintaining a good response in the blue range. We also aimed to reduce the significant fringing found in the red wavelengths. It took some time to find devices that met our strict requirements. The final solution provided by e2v was a custom two-layer anti-reflection (AR) coated Deep Depletion CCD (CCD44-82). This device was produced in a new AR coating facility by e2v and delivered to ESO in mid-2007, performing as expected.  
The new detector Carreras is a CCD44-82 with a resolution of 2k × 4k. It is electrically and mechanically identical to the previous detector (Bruce), allowing for a straightforward plug-in upgrade. Bruce is a standard silicon CCD44-82 with a nominal thickness of 16 µm and a single-layer AR coating optimized for blue sensitivity. In contrast, Carreras is a Deep Depletion device with a nominal thickness of 40 µm and features a special custom two-layer coating (HfO/SiO2) designed for optimal QE across the wavelength range of 370–950 nm. The upgrade involved assembling a new cryostat and installing Carreras, which was fully characterized in the new system. The GIRAFFE detector head and cryostat were then transported from Paranal to ESO Garching to allow for the field lens to be exchanged in the new setup.
