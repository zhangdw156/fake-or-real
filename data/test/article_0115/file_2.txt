ESO's public surveys using Vista are valuable for both scientific progress and preserving past research efforts due to their consistent design across multiple wavelengths (bands). These projects study diverse topics like searching for exoplanets through gravitational lensing effects or analyzing stars within our Milky Way galaxy along with other nearby galaxies in our Local Group. Following initial survey completion in 2015 , a second round was initiated (Cycle II) to create a unified scientific plan for Vista until its successor instrument (4MOST) is operational by early next decade . This article summarizes findings from cycle I surveys while also introducing seven new programs planned under cycle II which detail these programs objectives , target areas within space covered by each program ,and how they will be conducted . The article concludes by outlining what data will be released during cycle II along with anticipated timelines .
