Light phenomena from Earth's atmosphere have been captured in large photos taken at ESO observatories. These images show examples of airglow, which is faint light emitted by our atmosphere.  In areas like La Silla Observatory in Chile, airglow can create vibrant green and red hues in the night sky when viewed with cameras sensitive to long exposures. While visible to the naked eye under dark skies, these light effects are more noticeable when captured in photos taken by commercial cameras. Although they may look like a rare atmospheric phenomenon similar to auroras, they actually originate from the Earth's atmosphere itself. Airglow prevents complete darkness even without astronomical sources.
