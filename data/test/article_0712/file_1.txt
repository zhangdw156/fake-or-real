Currently, 22 students from 15 countries are conducting their PhD research at ESO Garching. Fifteen of these students are part of the ESO studentship program, allowing them to spend one or two years at ESO during their PhD while earning their degree from their home university. ESO’s Garching Headquarters is part of one of the largest centers for astronomy and physics globally, alongside other prominent institutions like the Max-Planck Institute for Astrophysics, the Max-Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE), the Institute for Plasma Physics, the Max-Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, and the Munich Technical University campus nearby. The German authorities recently acknowledged the strength of this concentration of scientific expertise, resulting in the establishment of the Excellence Cluster on the “Origin and Structure of the Universe.” In this dynamic setting, students have a wide array of seminars and lectures available, providing unique chances to learn about current topics and key questions in physics and astronomy.
