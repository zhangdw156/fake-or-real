Europe has been a leader in space research for astrometry and spectroscopy and is close to becoming the top player in photometry. The ESA's Hipparcos mission was groundbreaking in space astrometry, setting up the Gaia mission, which will conduct the first parallax survey for stars with an apparent magnitude of up to 20, while thoroughly characterizing each object observed. ESO's modern telescopes (NTT and VLT) along with advanced multi-object spectrographs have provided detailed elemental compositions of faint stars. ESO is set to begin large-scale optical and near-IR photometry using two specialized survey telescopes (VISTA and VST). This research is supported by unparalleled European proficiency in modeling stars and galaxies, covering areas like stellar atmospheres and evolution. The potential for European science is vast if we make significant efforts to fully leverage these resources, entailing effective use of our existing instruments along with plans for new facilities. It is crucial to enhance collaborations between Gaia and ground-based research, particularly involving current or future ESO instruments.
