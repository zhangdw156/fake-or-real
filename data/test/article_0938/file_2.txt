Europe has been a leader in galactic research, particularly in astrometry and spectroscopy, and is close to becoming a leader in photometry as well. The ESAâ€™s Hipparcos mission was the first to explore space astrometry and set the stage for the ambitious Gaia mission, which will execute the first parallax survey for stars down to magnitude V = 20 while fully characterizing each observed object. The innovative telescopes from the ESO, such as the NTT and VLT, along with advanced multi-object spectrographs, have provided detailed information on the chemical compositions of faint stars. Additionally, the ESO will soon begin extensive optical and near-infrared photometry projects using two dedicated survey telescopes, VISTA and VST. This observational work is supported by unique European expertise in star and galaxy modeling, including stellar atmospheres, evolution, population synthesis, and dynamics. The potential for European science is significant if we make strong efforts to effectively utilize these resources. This means maximizing the use of our current instruments and planning for new facilities. It is also crucial to optimize the collaboration between Gaia and ground-based observations, particularly with current or future ESO instruments.
