Sixty people participated in the workshop. Most attendees were friends, colleagues, and former PhD students of Tom. Unfortunately, not everyone invited could attend, and many were mentioned by Tom and others during their presentations. A significant number of those mentioned were PhD students and postdocs, considered Tom's scientific grandchildren. Following Tom's suggestion, the focus was on the future of molecular astrophysics rather than on a review of his career. Therefore, most of the program was dedicated to future research on interstellar matter and star formation in the Milky Way and in other galaxies. The organizers also chose to have Tom’s students serve as session chairpersons, who would give brief introductions and share anecdotes and personal experiences related to Tom. The workshop presentations, available online, included two types of talks. The first type was delivered by Tom’s old friends and colleagues, who reflected on his life and shared anecdotes, while also discussing future research areas for ALMA. The second type was presented by younger students, many of Tom's scientific grandchildren, focusing on ALMA’s role in their research fields. The after-dinner speech on June 16 was presented by Professor Robert Rood, who gave a detailed talk about Tom Wilson’s career.
