Sixty people participated in the workshop. Most of the attendees were Tom’s friends, colleagues, and former PhD students. Unfortunately, not everyone invited could attend; many of these individuals were noted by Tom and others in their presentations. A considerable portion of those mentioned were PhD students and postdocs, who Tom thinks of as his scientific grandchildren. Tom suggested that the focus be placed on the future of molecular astrophysics rather than a review of his own career. As a result, the majority of the program centered on future studies of interstellar matter and star formation in both the Milky Way and external galaxies. The organizers also chose to have Tom’s students serve as session chairpersons to introduce talks, sharing anecdotes and experiences from their associations with Tom. The workshop presentations, available online, featured two types of talks. The first were remembrance talks by Tom’s long-time friends and colleagues, who shared memories of him while also discussing future research directions involving ALMA. The second type incorporated presentations from the younger generation of students, many of whom soundly represent Tom’s scientific grandchildren; their focus was largely on highlighting ALMA’s impact in their areas of research. Professor Robert Rood delivered the after-dinner speech on June 16, offering an in-depth talk about Tom Wilson’s career.
