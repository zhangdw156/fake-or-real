Over many years, scientists have observed that active galactic nuclei (AGN), which power supermassive black holes at their centers, eject gas into space rapidly in a process known as outflows. These fast outflows are common near regions where supermassive black holes accrete material. However, these observations are significant because they also affect the star formation within galaxies.  

Scientists use spectroscopic methods to track these gas outflows over larger distances, revealing evidence of such gas movement in various phases (molecular, atomic and ionized).  While this phenomenon appears in most galaxies that experience active star formation, there's growing evidence from nearby and distant sources that extreme outflows are strongly linked to the activity of AGN.

In our current research, we focus on "warm" ionised outflows at temperatures around 10⁴ Kelvin, which can easily be detected through optical emission lines such as [O III] and Hα.  Observing broad and asymmetric emission lines is a strong indication of outflowing gas material.   Thanks to extensive spectroscopic surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), it's possible to search for such features in massive samples of nearby galaxies at various redshifts, which allows us to determine their prevalence over long periods of cosmic history. 

To get more detailed information about these outflows, we utilize spatially resolved spectroscopy with optical integral field units (IFUs) and measure key properties like the spatial distribution and the energy output of the outflows. Combining these IFU observations with other multi-wavelength follow-up observations allows us to understand their significance in relation to the entire population of galaxies.  By comparing our findings to cosmological simulations, we gain a better understanding of how representative these observations are of galaxy evolution overall.
