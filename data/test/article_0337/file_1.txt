underground cave exploration had some challenges during its initial runs:
Bad Weather: Two scheduled nights from August suffered from extreme cold temperatures causing snow as well as technical difficulties with part responsible for focusing light onto target objects on one telescope unit making those two entire days unusable (total loss).
Successful Night: On Augurst's final day after overcoming initial challenges some data was collected including images from globular clusters; stars forming within dwarf galaxies; supernovae sites; black hole locations within galaxies; among many others .
Additional Nights: Two extra nights allocated on September saw variable results but allowed collection data from several programs including observing features like blue compact galaxies; star formations within dwarf galaxies ; near-by galactic nuclei ; places where supernovae occur; influences exerted by black holes near galactic centers .
Despite these successes approximately half or even less than half of planned observation sessions took place because:
Conflicts with Other Programs: Other telescopes often take priority when it comes down who can use laser beams which is why we couldn't complete all our planned observation sessions
Seeing Conditions: While there was good overall image quality overall , sometimes poor visibility hampered capturing high-quality images needed by some ambitious programs .
