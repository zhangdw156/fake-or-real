**Measuring Improved Distances to Nearby Galaxies: The Araucaria Project**  
Recent extensive use of ESO telescopes has enabled significant advancements in understanding star populations and measuring distances to nearby galaxies. We present new developments in utilizing Cepheid variables and blue supergiant stars for precise galaxy distance measurements. This research will substantially decrease the uncertainty in the Hubble constant, which gauges the current rate of the Universe's expansion. Determining distances to astronomical objects has been a fundamental challenge since humans began observing the stars. Accurate distance measurements to galaxies are essential for studying various astrophysical phenomena, including the true energy outputs of bright sources, and are crucial for establishing correct cosmological parameters that describe the current state and history of the Universe. One important parameter is the Hubble constant (H0), which assesses the current acceleration of the expanding Universe. About ten years ago, the HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale aimed to measure Cepheid distances to a selection of nearby galaxies to calibrate secondary distance measurement methods for determining the distances to more remote galaxies, ultimately providing an unbiased value for H0. However, they faced challenges since Cepheid variables are not a perfect distance measurement tool. Cepheids, like other stellar standard candles, are influenced by the environmental characteristics of their host galaxies, especially the abundance of heavy elements and the ages of the stars. These factors must be considered to obtain truly accurate distances to nearby galaxies. With this in mind, our team initiated a thorough investigation a few years ago into various stellar distance indicators, including Cepheids, blue supergiants, RR Lyrae stars, red clump giants, and the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) magnitude as part of the Araucaria Project. This initiative complements the HST Key Project. Over the past two years, the Araucaria Project has gained Large Programme status at ESO, yielding several important scientific findings from the rich data collected using ESO telescopes, some of which will be briefly discussed in this article. In this report, we will concentrate on two types of distance indicators: the pulsating Cepheid variables and the highly luminous blue supergiant stars.
