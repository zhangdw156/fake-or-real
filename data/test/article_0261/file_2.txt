The primary objective is understanding how different types of objects formed within or around our galaxy (the Milky Way). This includes identifying individual star populations based on their age and composition as well as analyzing how they contribute towards forming a part called "the galactic halo."
To achieve this goal researchers aim at analyzing over one million young stellar objects across various regions within our galaxy using spectroscopy techniques like those used with telescopes like Kepler Space Telescope TESS which study exoplanets outside our solar system . They plan on measuring multiple elements within each object's spectrum using this data which helps determine its chemical makeup history .
The team hopes this analysis can reveal crucial information about early stages of galactic evolution through studying metal content variations among these ancient star populations called "very metal poor" celestial bodies .
They intend utilizing an existing catalogue generated from data collected via Gaia spacecraft mission which has already identified potential candidates based on its image recognition capabilities . The initial catalog estimates approximately two hundred thousand unique objects classified as belonging specifically into "halo" category , representing enough samples for accurate analysis based on simulations showing similar structures found throughout other galaxies .
However there is one limitation - detailed velocity measurements cannot always be obtained due limitations imposed by faintness levels observed with current instruments used for observing distant celestial bodies such as those used currently aboard NASAs Spitzer Space Telescope or Hubble Space Telescope , so additional observations would need further investigations after initial data collection has taken place
