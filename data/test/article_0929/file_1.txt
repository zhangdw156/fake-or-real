Mira stars are popular among amateur variable star observers due to their significant changes in brightness in visible light. These are giant stars that have nearly depleted their nuclear fuel and are losing mass quickly before transitioning into white dwarfs. They pulsate with cycles of several hundred days, and their outer layers produce molecules and dust. In billions of years, the Sun will become a Mira star, covering the Earth with dust and gas. While Mira stars are significant sources of molecules and dust in the Universe, the precise shape, density, and composition of the materials they expel are still under discussion. The well-known Mira star T Leporis is located 170 parsecs away and has a pulsation period of 380 days. Despite being a giant star, its distance makes it only resolvable by advanced facilities like the VLTI. Recently, we obtained detailed images using data from four configurations of three Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs). Unlike previous studies that combined all spectral channels, we created independent images for each wavelength. We utilized the MIRA software with a specific two-step approach. The first step was to generate a radially symmetric image based on data, supported by earlier analysis showing no obvious differences in size across directions. This initial image allowed for the use of simpler constraints and resulted in a reliable ring-like structure. However, the assumption of a smooth central star may not be accurate, as it could have sharper edges. The second step took these initial brightness distributions to enhance the 2D images, enabling the software to detect asymmetries. The resulting images, though only a few pixels across, reveal a close-up of a star roughly one hundred times the size of the Sun, corresponding to the distance from the Earth to the Sun. This star is surrounded by a sphere of material about three times larger, clearly showing an envelope of dust and gas that varies in appearance and opacity with wavelength.
