Mira stars are popular for amateur variable star observers due to their significant brightness variations in visible light. These are large stars nearing the end of their nuclear fuel, shedding mass rapidly before evolving into cool white dwarfs. They oscillate over periods of several hundred days, leading to the formation of molecules and dust in their atmospheric layers. The Sun is expected to become a Mira star in several billion years, migrating the dust and gas from it into the vicinity of Earth. Despite being major producers of a range of molecules and dust in the Universe, the precise shape, density, and make-up of this released material is still questioned. T Leporis, a classic Mira star, is situated 170 parsecs away and pulses every 380 days. Its distance means that only advanced facilities like the VLTI can capture clear images of it. We accomplished this recently using data from four setups involving three-array telescopes. Instead of merging all the spectral channels like with Î¸1 Ori C or HD87643, we created a separate image for each wavelength band. We utilized the MIRA software implementing a two-step approach. First, we derived a circular image from the data, an idea backed by earlier data reviews indicating uniformity in size across different angles. This initial guess relied on somewhat basic assumptions. Surprisingly, the recovered ring-like formation is quite reliable. However, our assumption about the star's smoothness may not reflect reality since quick transitions in its edges may exist. The second step processes these brightness distributions for the refined 2D images, enabling the software to recognize asymmetries. The recovered images, albeit small, represent a detailed view of a star approximately one hundred times larger than the Sun, equating to about the Earth-Sun distance. This star seems to be surrounded by a material shell extending roughly three times further. These images clearly illustrate the existence of a the dust and gas envelope around a Mira star, revealing variations in aspect ratio and opacity depending on the wavelength.
