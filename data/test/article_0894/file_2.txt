Two recent studies indicate that objects slightly more massive than Jupiter have discs of dust and gas, which are essential for forming planets. This implies that smaller versions of solar systems might exist around objects hundreds of times less massive than our Sun. It has been understood for several years that many young brown dwarfs, which are ‘failed stars’ with less than eight percent of the Sun's mass, are enveloped in material discs. This suggests they form similarly to our Sun. The new research confirms that even smaller objects, referred to as planetary-mass objects or ‘planemos,’ also show this behavior. These objects have masses like those of exoplanets but do not orbit stars; instead, they drift freely in space. Ray Jayawardhana, the lead author of the study, comments that the discovery of these planetary-mass objects with their own developing planetary systems complicates the definition of a ‘planet.’ He notes that it is not surprising, as Jupiter likely formed with its own disc that created its larger moons. However, these planetary-mass objects do not orbit stars. In the study, Jayawardhana analyzed six candidates using the VLT and NTT, identifying four with masses between five and 15 times that of Jupiter. All four are very young, just a few million years old, and located in star-forming regions approximately 450 light years from Earth, exhibiting infrared emissions from dusty discs that could evolve into small planetary systems over time. In a separate study, Subhanjoy Mohanty, Ray Jayawardhana, Nuria Huelamo, and Eric Mamajek utilized the VLT and NACO to capture images and spectra of a planetary-mass companion found near a young brown dwarf, which is about 25 times as massive as Jupiter. This companion is the first exoplanet ever imaged. The brown dwarf, nicknamed M1-07 and located 170 light years from Earth, was already known to have a surrounding disc, and this team found evidence of a disc around the eight-Jupiter-mass companion as well.
