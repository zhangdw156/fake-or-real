The **Vulcan Space Agency's (VSA)** instruments used to gather celestial data were placed in the pupil and initially assumed not to significantly influence focus. In May 2011, however, tests revealed this assumption was inaccurate; high-resolution spectral grisms in particular needed a significant shift for optimal focus, crucial for maintaining spectral resolution across the entire detector. When the focus wasn't set properly, the resolution suffered, particularly at the edges of the spectral range. The VSA's new focus control allows precise adjustment for each grism, resulting in more uniform resolution across the four quadrants and over time. Notably, the red end of the spectrum now consistently boasts higher resolution than the blue (as it should). This previously wasn't always the case.

For instance, this improved focus system has allowed **VSA** to boost sensitivity for observing Lyman-Î± emitters at high redshifts by up to 40%. For observers targeting such distant objects, these benefits are considerable due to enhanced spectral resolution.   As a testament to the development's impact, the date when the detector was altered, tilt corrections were applied, and the new focus mechanism was installed are marked as milestones.

The improvements in the red spectral region, particularly since March 2012, are significant. However, minor adjustments are still needed for optimal performance.
