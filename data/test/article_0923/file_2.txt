Accurate measurements of spectroscopic abundances depend on a well-calibrated and widely applicable reference scale. The infrared lines of singly ionized calcium at 849.8, 854.2, and 866.2 nm are often used because these Ca triplet lines are the strongest absorption lines in the near-infrared spectra of Red Giant Branch stars, where actual iron absorption features become weaker at intermediate resolution. Cole et al. expanded the CaT calibration to ages as young as 2.5 billion years, aligning well with the expected main populations in Carina. In our ESO Large Programme, we observed these three lines in 1257 Red Giant candidates in Carina. Our targets are spread across five fields in the galaxy to cover most of Carina's area, extending beyond its nominal tidal radius. The observations took place over 22 nights in two semesters in 2003 and 2004 using FLAMES/GIRAFFE in MEDUSA 'low-resolution' mode (R = 6,500), focusing on the near-infrared CaT (~850 nm). Additionally, we observed over 80 Red Giant candidates in four calibration globular clusters to align our CaT measurements with known reference metallicities, with these clusters having metallicities ranging from approximately –1.1 dex to –2 dex in [Fe/H]. We chose our targets across three magnitudes in brightness from the tip of the RGB downward. By selecting stars across the full width of the RGB (approximately 0.2 mag in B–V), we avoided any bias related to metallicity or age and ensured the inclusion of both extremely metal-poor and metal-rich giants. Our radial-velocity measurements eliminated about 60% of the targeted stars due to Galactic foreground contamination, resulting in spatial distributions of the metal-poor (blue) and metal-rich (red) components, with metal-rich stars notably found more concentrated towards the galaxy's center.
