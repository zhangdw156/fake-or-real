Accurate measurements of spectroscopic abundances depend on a long-lasting and widely used reference scale. The infrared lines of the singly ionized calcium ion at 849.8, 854.2, and 866.2 nm are often used since these Calcium triplet lines are among the clearest absorption lines in the near-infrared spectra of Red Giant Branch stars, where authentic iron absorption lines become weaker at moderate resolution. Cole et al. expanded the calibration of these Calcium triplet lines to ages as young as 2.5 billion years, fitting well with expected prominent populations in the Carina galaxy. We examined these lines in 1257 Red Giant candidates in Carina through our ESO Large Programme. Our subjects were located over five areas in the galaxy to cover most of Carina, including regions beyond its usual boundary. Observations took place over 22 nights spread across two semesters in 2003 and 2004 using FLAMES/GIRAFFE in MEDUSA 'low-resolution' mode (R = 6,500), focused on the near-infrared Calcium triplet (~850 nm). Additionally, we observed more than 80 Red Giant candidates in four calibration globular clusters to anchor our measurements on known reference metallicities, which ranged from about -1.1 dex to -2 dex in [Fe/H]. We targeted a range of brightness across three magnitudes from the top of the Red Giant Branch downward. By selecting stars across the entire breadth of the Red Giant Branch (about 0.2 magnitude in Bâ€“V), we minimized bias regarding metallicity or age and included both extremely metal-poor and metal-rich giants. Our radial-velocity measurements eliminated nearly 60% of the selected stars due to Galactic foreground contamination, leaving us with spatial distributions of metal-poor (blue) and metal-rich (red) components. Metal-rich stars are noticeably more densely found towards the center of the galaxy.
