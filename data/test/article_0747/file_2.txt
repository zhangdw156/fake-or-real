The V–I color was used to calculate photometric temperatures using the infrared flux method. To further gauge the star's temperature, we measured the strength of the TiO band with an index defined between 6190–6250 Angstroms (for the band) and 6120–6155 Angstroms (for the continuum region). It is important to note that photometric temperature served only as an initial estimate. The final temperature used is spectroscopic, determined by achieving excitation equilibrium from about 60 Fei lines. Photometric gravity was calculated based on the mass and radius, with the radius estimated using the Stefan–Boltzmann law, which relates total flux (absolute bolometric magnitude), temperature, and radius of a blackbody. For the calculations, we used an average distance of 8 kiloparsecs for the Bulge, T0 = 5770 Kelvin, log g0 = 4.44, M0,bol = 4.75, and M* = 0.85 M0. Note that photometric gravity was recalculated at each step of the iterative process to determine the stellar parameters and metallicity, using the relevant (spectroscopic) temperature and metallicity. Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) abundance analysis was conducted using standard methods and the new MARCS spherical models. Excitation equilibrium was applied to the Fei lines to refine the photometric effective temperature, while photometric gravity was applied even if ionization equilibrium was not achieved. The microturbulence velocity (VT) was determined by maintaining a constant [Fe/H] for lines of different expected strengths (predicted equivalent widths for a given stellar model). After settling on the best stellar parameters, we calculated the [Fe/H] for each star as a weighted average of the line-by-line measurements. Each line's weight is based on the inverse square of its abundance error, derived from the error in the measured equivalent widths. We have three independent estimates of internal errors: i) from repeated independent analyses; ii) by comparison with the UVES results; and iii) using globular cluster stars. These yield sigma[Fe/H] values of 0.09, 0.16, and 0.12 dex, respectively. A comparison of iron abundances from GIRAFFE and UVES for stars observed in both configurations is included. All estimates consider a smaller statistical error (less than 0.06 dex) due to line-to-line variation, but each reflects only part of the potential error sources. Integrating the different tests and acknowledging that some systematic factors (non-LTE effects, uncertainties in the model atmospheres, etc.) are not accounted for, we estimate an uncertainty of plus or minus 0.2 dex for the metallicity of an individual star, factoring in both statistical and systematic effects.
