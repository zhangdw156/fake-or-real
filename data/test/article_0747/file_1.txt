The V–I color was used to calculate photometric temperatures using the infrared flux method. To further gauge the star's temperature, we measured the strength of the TiO band with an index defined between 6190–6250 Angstroms (for the band) and 6120–6155 Angstroms (for the continuum region). It is important to note that photometric temperature serves only as an initial estimate. The final temperature used is spectroscopic, determined by achieving excitation equilibrium from about 60 Fei lines. Photometric gravity was calculated based on the mass and radius, the latter obtained using the Stefan–Boltzmann law, which relates total flux (absolute bolometric magnitude), temperature, and the radius of a blackbody. In the calculations, a mean distance of 8 kiloparsecs for the Bulge, T0 = 5770 Kelvin, log g0 = 4.44, M0,bol = 4.75, and M* = 0.85 M0 has been used. It is noted that during each step in the iterative process of determining stellar parameters and metallicity, photometric gravity was recalculated using the correct (spectroscopic) temperature and metallicity. Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) abundance analysis was conducted following standard procedures with the latest MARCS spherical models. Constraints were applied to the Fei lines to fine-tune the photometric effective temperature, with photometric gravity being used even when ionization equilibrium was absent. The microturbulence velocity (VT) was found by assuming a constant [Fe/H] for lines with varying expected strengths (predicted equivalent widths). Lastly, once we obtained the best stellar parameters, the [Fe/H] for each star was calculated as a weighted average of individual line measurements, with the weight based on the inverse square of its abundance error, which stems from equivalent width measurement errors. We identified three independent estimates of internal errors: i) through repeated and independent analysis; ii) by comparing with UVES results; and iii) empirical studies of globular cluster stars. These analyses provided values for sigma[Fe/H] of 0.09, 0.16, and 0.12 dex. A comparison of iron abundances derived from GIRAFFE and UVES for stars studied with both methods is included. All estimates account for small statistical errors (less than 0.06 dex) related to line-to-line variability, but each only covers a portion of all potential error sources. By combining these tests and noting that some systematics (non-LTE effects, uncertainties in model atmospheres, etc.) have been disregarded, we estimate a conservative uncertainty of plus or minus 0.2 dex for individual star metallicities, encompassing both statistical and systematic factors.
