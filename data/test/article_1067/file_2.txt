The Phase 2 public survey tools were introduced to survey teams at a two and a half-day workshop at ESO from September 15 to 17, 2008. Presents from the ESO public surveys were invited, along with two other team members responsible for preparing the Phase 2 submission. Over 30 astronomers from the VST and VISTA teams participated in the workshop. Each team received training on the new Phase 2 tools on ESO computers and was encouraged to prepare Observation Blocks for the Phase 2 submission, which reflected the first year of survey observations. Due to overlapping scientific interests between the VISTA and VST surveys, the three VST principal investigators also joined the corresponding VISTA teams for the preparation exercise. The workshop featured presentations on the statuses of the VST and VISTA, an overview of the survey telescope operations, and specific introductions to the Phase 2 tools. The second day focused on demonstrating the Phase 2 tools, SADT and P2PP, followed by tutorials led by the ESO Survey Team. This collaboration enabled valuable exchanges and feedback for tool improvement. On the final day, the science verification program for VISTA was presented to the survey teams, leading into discussions on the scientific objectives of the surveys and gauging the teams' preparedness for the demanding projects ahead.
