The Phase 2 tools for public surveys were introduced to the survey teams in a two-and-a-half-day workshop at ESO from September 15 to 17, 2008. Principal Investigators (PIs) of the ESO public surveys were invited to attend, along with two additional team members responsible for preparing the Phase 2 submission. Over 30 astronomers from the VST and VISTA survey teams participated. Each team received training on the new Phase 2 tools installed on ESO computers and was invited to prepare Observation Blocks (OBs) for the first year's worth of survey observations. Due to overlapping scientific objectives, the three VST PIs were also invited to collaborate with the VISTA teams during the Phase 2 preparation. The workshop included presentations on the status of the VST and VISTA surveys, a review of telescope operations, and an introduction to the Phase 2 tools. The second day featured demonstrations of the Phase 2 tools, SADT and P2PP, followed by tutorials led by the ESO Survey Team, fostering valuable exchanges and feedback for tool improvement. On the final day, the VISTA science verification program was presented to the teams, followed by discussions on the science goals of the surveys and the readiness of the survey teams to begin these complex projects.
