Understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy requires investigating various aspects like:

* **Chemical composition:** Tracking element distribution to understand timelines and rates of mixing and accretion. 
* **Stellar activity:** Studying star formation history, nucleosynthesis, and internal processes within stars.
* **Spatial patterns:** Identifying structures and gradients in space.
* **Motion analysis:**  Uncovering information about dark matter through its effect on galaxy clusters and by examining the dynamics of mergers.

The Gaia satellite will provide valuable data on the ages of evolved field stars for the first time, thanks to stellar models calibrated with cluster data. A large-scale spectroscopic survey is necessary to accurately determine spatial and temporal gradients of various distribution functions.  The Gaia-ESO Survey will be that crucial survey. It will also create a consistent dataset for a vast range of stars (field and cluster). This unique information will help address numerous scientific questions, such as: 
* Studying the formation, evolution, and disruption of star clusters.
* Validating complex physics affecting stellar lifespan.
* Quantifying the distribution of substructures within the galaxy, dark matter, and rare stars.
* Investigating the nature of the bulge.
* Understanding the origin and structure of the thick disc.
* Investigating the formation, evolution, and structure of the thin disc. 
* Studying the kinematic distribution function of multiple elements in the solar neighborhood.
