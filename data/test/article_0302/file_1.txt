The first phase ("Phase 1") of the "4 MOST" project begins with submitting "Letters Of Intent". These letters should detail:
The scientific goals you aim to achieve during your observations;
The scope - how many objects you intend to observe across space time; including luminosity range estimated fiber hours needed;
A preliminary team list outlining roles within your research group; whether it's partcipating or nonparticipating within "the" project generally known as 'the consortium.'
After reviewing these letters from potential participants ("letters"), up tp one hundred teams may receive invitations based on their submitted letter's content,"to submit full proposal packages." This package includes detailed information about your planned research including:
A comprehensive explanation about why your chosen fieldobject matters within context overall 'the' project generally known as 'the consortium.' This should include specific details about how successful observation would benefit future research efforts.;
To assess feasibility before submitting formal applications (proposals), researchers can utilize tools like Exposure Time Calculator offered via ESOs website. In addition there are tools developed specifically by The consortium. These resources help determine if projects are feasible given available resources such as exposure time allotted per objecttarget etc...
Once selected teams finalize all aspects related to submission requests ("proposals"), they must present comprehensive data product timelines along side supporting documentation confirming approval from The director general. This ensures efficient execution throughout each phase while minimizing any potential delays caused by unforeseen circumstances during execution .
