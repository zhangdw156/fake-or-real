Phase One begins with submitting letters outlining your scientific goals using specific details like target numbers location on sky maps; expected observation time needed; initial team members roles; whether it's part or not part of the larger project called "Four MOST". You'll receive tools like Exposure Time Calculators to assess your proposal's feasibility based on individual starstargets then potential merging based on shared goals between researchers who submitted similar projects during Phase Two .
During Phase Two you need further information including detailed scientific justification , mock target catalogues including templates specific criteria along with defined measurement objectives . A web simulator helps you test how feasible your planned observations are before submission..
Finally after selecting projects from both public applications submitted by researchers via ESOs peer review process , they have to submit comprehensive plans detailing data products expected from each project along side timelines so they can get approved before starting work under ESA oversight .
