[WC] stars are central stars of planetary nebulae (PNe) that have emission lines similar to those found in massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Their origins are unclear, but their stellar spectra lack hydrogen, indicating they have lost their hydrogen layers. Some of these stars are very strong infrared emitters, with a higher ratio of dust luminosity to Lyman-alpha (Lya) flux than any other PNe. Most or all of these IR-[WC] stars exhibit a chemical dichotomy, showing both strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission and distinct crystalline silicates. Figures 3 and 4 depict these two objects. Figure 3 includes a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) image of CPD-56˚803, showing an irregular nebula around a bright central star. The VLTI/MIDI single dish image reveals a bright core at 8 microns; after deconvolution, this core is resolved with an elliptical diameter of 0.4 × 0.3 arcsec. The VLTI/MIDI shows weak fringes, with visibility varying based on the position angle. We model these fringes with an ellipsoidal ring that has an aspect ratio of 0.5 (equivalent to a 30˚ angle view) and a radius of 75 milliarcseconds (mas). Assuming a distance of 1.35 kiloparsecs (kpc), the inner radius of this ring is 97 astronomical units (AU). There is no clear preferred axis in the system based on our HST and VLTI/MIDI observations. The expected location of the silicates in the inner disc is not fully confirmed. Our VLTI/MIDI spectra indicate that some strong PAH emission originates from the central source, with about a third of the flux from the 7.8 and 8.6 micron PAH features detected in the VLTI/MIDI spectrum, but only about a quarter of the 11–14 micron plateau, and the 11.2 micron feature is nearly absent. This discrepancy may be due to the ionization of PAHs in the central object. The observed features primarily relate to C-H modes, indicating that although the star is hydrogen-poor, the central PAHs are hydrogenated. The oxygen-rich material remains undetected but may be too cold to emit at 10 microns. Our infrared spectrum model suggests that the disc may extend out to about 1000 AU, with the observed core marking the inner edge of this disc. This implies a model where PAHs are concentrated at the inner edge of an otherwise oxygen-rich, possibly flared disc, potentially formed at the turbulent interface between the star's carbon-rich, hydrogen-poor wind and the disc. He-113 displays a more regular shape, as shown in Figure 4, which includes a three-colour image indicating a large torus and a bipolar outflow. Again, there is an infrared source at the center with a diameter of about 150 mas, surrounded by a void, but VLTI data did not reveal any more compact structure. The inner rim observed in CPD-56˚803 appears absent in He-113, where PAH emissions do not show an evident central source, although a large disc seems to be present.
