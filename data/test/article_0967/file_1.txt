[WC] stars are central stars of planetary nebulae (PNe) that have emission lines quite similar to those of massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Their origins are not well understood, but the lack of hydrogen in their spectra indicates they have lost their hydrogen layers completely. Some of these objects are exceedingly strong emitters of infrared radiation, exhibiting a dust luminosity to Lya flux ratio that is the highest among PNe. Most or all of these IR-[WC] stars display a chemical contrast, characterized by both intense polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions and prominent crystalline silicates. Figures 3 and 4 present images of these two stars. Figure 3 highlights an HST image of CPD-56˚803, revealing an irregular nebula surrounding a bright central star. The VLTI/MIDI single dish image indicates a bright core at 8 microns, and after deconvolution, this core shows an elliptical diameter of 0.4 × 0.3 arcsec. Observations from VLTI/MIDI show very faint fringes with visibilities that vary with position angle. These fringes are modeled as an ellipsoidal ring with a 0.5 aspect ratio, corresponding to a viewing angle of 30˚ and a radius of 75 mas. Based on a presumed distance of 1.35 kpc, the inner radius of this ring is 97 AU. There is no evidence of a preferred orientation from our HST images and VLTI/MIDI observations. While it is expected that the inner disc is where silicates are found, this has not been fully confirmed. Our VLTI/MIDI spectra indicate that some strong PAH emissions originate from the central star; approximately a third of the flux from the 7.8 and 8.6 micron PAH features is captured by the VLTI/MIDI spectrum, as opposed to roughly a fourth of the 11–14 microns plateau, and the 11.2 micron feature is nearly absent in the VLTI/MIDI spectrum. The discrepancy may be attributed to ionization of the PAHs in the central star. The observed emissions largely represent C-H vibrations, thus the central PAHs contain hydrogen even though the star itself lacks it. Oxygen-rich material is not detected, likely because it is too cool to emit at 10 microns. Our infrared spectrum model suggests that the disc might extend out to about 1000 AU: the noted core corresponds to the inner boundary of this disc. This supports a scenario where the PAHs reside at the inner edge of an otherwise oxygen-rich disc, possibly flared. The PAHs may develop at the turbulent, bow-shock region between the star's carbon-rich, hydrogen-poor wind and the disc. He-113 features a more streamlined structure. Figure 4 shows a three-color image highlighting a large torus and a bipolar outflow. Again, there is an infrared source at the center, with a diameter of approximately 150 mas, flanked by an empty area. VLTI data reveal no further compact structures. The inner rim present in CPD-56˚803 appears absent in He-113, and likewise, the PAH emission does not reveal a distinct central origin. However, a large disc does seem to be present in both cases.
