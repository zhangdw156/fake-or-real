The VLT AT's Stereo-SCIDAR telescope successfully obtained its first light in April 2016 after being fully integrated at Paranal Observatory's coude focus area. A follow-up campaign took place later that year (July) allowing for testing various aspects like functionality and data archiving over a period spanning five nights before an extended trial period began October onwards . The entire system passed all tests demonstrating full compliance with pre-defined requirements despite extensive testing over eleven nights covering various operational aspects including user interface optimization based on feedback from technicians (TIO). Data collection was successful throughout these initial tests demonstrating reliable results from their atmospheric profile analysis software . No significant issues were reported regarding either hardware or software functionality during this initial phase which included both smooth operation as well as successful data collection under optimal weather conditions . Overall this marked a successful start to implementing this new instrument into astronomical observation procedures at Paranal Observatory .
