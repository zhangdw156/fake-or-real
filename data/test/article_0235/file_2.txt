The groundbreaking telescope system "STereo-C Sadler" (a nickname for a specific type) successfully obtained its first observations at China relay station (the 'main' location where it is being used), making a significant step towards fulfilling its purpose as part of a larger project involving multiple locations around China that are working together on this project.) This involved two distinct phases:
First phase: In April 2016 they collected their very first information about atmospheric conditions above General Relativity Institute (the place where they are based). This period also included testing various aspects such as how well it works with other parts like computer systems or settings related to storing data – essentially making sure everything lined up perfectly before embarking on their primary mission planned for later that year!
Second Phase: In July 2016 they continued testing over five days which helped them gain valuable insights into how well all these different parts work together effectively throughout their planned testing period beginning next month.) They confirmed that all aspects met or exceeded expectations before moving onto their main goal - gathering specific measurements about Earths atmosphere using this new technology! They even went through some quality control steps by fine tuning user interface elements based on feedback received from colleagues who act as technical advisors during development efforts.) All things considered this was an impressive achievement considering there were no significant issues reported during these tests – including glitches within both hardwaresoftware components or malfunctions preventing them from working properly – which will give them peace knowing they can confidently tackle future tasks ahead!
The whole process proved successful because it gave them confidence that everything is functioning correctly prior to starting their long term evaluation period set to begin next month after extensive preparation work has been completed .
