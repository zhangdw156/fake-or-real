The observations were conducted from October 15th to November 3rd, 2009, during which time astronomers observed using a support system. A comprehensive record of these observations is available on the VISTA SV website. Weather conditions generally allowed for clear skies with low atmospheric turbulence (seeing less than 1.2 arcseconds) for most nights. Four nights were lost due to weather or technical issues. The galaxy NGC 253 was observed in the first half of the nights when the airmass was below 1.5, while Orion was observable during the second half when its airmass surpassed 2.0.  About 60% of extragalactic mini-survey observations and 10% of Galactic mini-survey data were produced at Paranal Observatory simultaneously with the data collection process. The reductions involved processing the VIRCAM camera's image data using a software pipeline version 0.9.6, including adjusting the processing blocks to incorporate current calibrations for optimal results, which included sky subtraction utilizing offset frames.  For the OB level, these adjustments produced stacked jittered images per pawprint, alongside photometric catalogs, confidence maps, and off-set sky images. These improvements provided ESO astronomers who support user needs and conduct scientific operations with opportunities to gain experience using the VIRCAM data processing pipeline. This also allowed them to investigate specific parameters such as de-striping techniques and develop the best methods for collecting offset sky observations.  During this period, the instrument's template parameters were also measured in detail as described below. The further reduction of SV data beyond the pawprint level — which involves creating tiles, mosaics, and merging the band catalogs — is a continuous process being coordinated within the ESO Garching team by the SV leads (principal investigators), and by Irwin at CASU.
