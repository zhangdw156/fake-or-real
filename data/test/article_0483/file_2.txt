The ALMA observatory is providing new information about the structure and development of baby stars (protostars) and young stellar objects.  ALMA's data suggests there might be a small inner disc within the protostar, which helps explain how the star develops in the protostellar stage. Using data on different candidates of these objects across the galaxy, ALMA is providing detailed analysis that allows comparison to models of high-mass star formation. This new knowledge offers important insights into the processes involved in forming extremely massive stars and their discs.  Finally, ALMA's ability to capture very clear images of young stellar clusters is helping scientists understand how these clusters form.
