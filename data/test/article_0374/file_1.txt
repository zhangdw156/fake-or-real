The VISTA survey tests were successful in evaluating Phase 2 tools and science operation. Results are summarized here. ESO astronomers confirmed that the survey's geometric definition matched the frames acquired using the VIRCAM pipeline's astrometry calibration for OB data products. Specific parameters like overlap tiles, sky orientation on a grid, and combination of six pawprints into a tile were verified against corresponding data products.  These testing activities included the new scheduling containers implemented in P2PP (for surveys).  The implementation at P2PP level is functioning well.  VIRCAM's templates allow for multiple filters in a single OB; however, the nesting of different filters, pawprint sequences, and jittering offsets needed to be verified during this test survey. All tested configurations were successful except for a few that were documented or solved before Phase 2 implementation.   Overheads for scheduling OBs (observing blocks) were measured during the ESO commissioning phase in July 2009 and integrated into P2PP. Verification was done by user astronomers at the P2PP level, and more robust statistics will be gathered with a larger number of observations as operations continue. The VIRCAM detectors' persistence, linearity, and saturation levels were tested.  The observed results for bright stars in the Orion survey showed very low persistence; only a very weak signal (1.5 standard deviations above background) was detected 1 minute after saturation occurred for a K magnitude 2.2 star. No measurable persistence after 2 minutes. Filter fringing checks were conducted and none were found. Linearity and saturation testing were performed during the initial commissioning, with detailed information available on the CASU website.  Lastly, the intensity of the sky background was observed through the evening twilight; a sequence of J-band and Z-band observations was made for NGC 253 mini-survey. The frame sequence shows a noticeable decrease in sky background intensity with time in both bands (J-band exhibits more significant change than Z-band).
