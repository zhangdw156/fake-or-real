In recent years, as the VLTI's next generation instruments GRAVITY and MATISSE were being developed, the infrastructure supporting the VLTI needed updating. To prepare, in April 2015, the instruments at Paranal were covered with protective tarpaulins before major upgrades began. The area became quite busy with activity, not just within the VLTI Laboratory itself but also at other sites: the Coudé rooms of the UTs and combined laboratories; and the VLTI computer room.  To accommodate the new instruments, their electrical, cooling, cryogenic, and network infrastructure had to be extensively modified. This involved drilling through walls to create new cable pathways, installing pipes for a new cooling system, and changing or adding pumps, power distribution, and other equipment. All of these changes demanded significant effort from the teams. In addition, upgrades needed to be done in the Coudé rooms of the UTs.  This prepared them for the arrival of CIAO, GRAVITY's infrared wavefront sensors; along with relocating control equipment and star separators into new cabinets, also during this process.
