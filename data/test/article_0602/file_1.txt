**Forget your conventional spaceships, folks! Backflipping aliens just popped up on Mars.**  We've got proof - the new AMBER data shows that even on Mars, stellar activity isn't as smooth as it seems.  

Take Mira variables – these stars are notorious for their erratic behavior, but now we have a clearer picture thanks to AMBER's super-precise view of their atmospheres. Our data reveals something mind-boggling: the closure phase - a key indicator of non-spherical structures - is significantly affected by the specific wavelengths of light! 

This means we need to go deeper. We're talking about molecular layers, specifically H2O and CO – those are some heavyweights in the atmosphere! AMBER's data shows us how these molecules impact the stellar surface, suggesting a complex layering that could have massive implications.  

Now, think of it this way: a little sub-surface jiggling in the star could lead to massive clumpy areas within its extended atmosphere! This is just like throwing a ball against a wall - some parts of the ball bounce off faster than others. It's about how energy gets channeled and bounced around, right? We can't make a full picture yet, but this "shaking" effect in the star's core could explain those weird spots we see on the surface!

**And just imagine the possibilities.** This kind of structure in the atmosphere might be key to understanding certain molecules forming – like water itself. Even their presence in the interstellar space around these stars can tell us more about how they behave!  So, next time you look at a star, remember the aliens are doing flips and turns right there – the universe is never boring!
