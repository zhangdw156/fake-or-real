The AMBER instrument used to study these targets shows that their atmospheric closure phases have non-zero values for all wavelengths, indicating deviations from point symmetry.  This is consistent with previous observations of Mira variables using other interferometers.  AMBER's unique combination of spectroscopic and interferometric techniques reveals a complex wavelength-dependent closure phase signal that correlates with the molecular layers, especially H2O and CO. This suggests a non-spherical atmospheric stratification characterized by inhomogeneities, particularly where molecules form and emit light.  However, given the limited data available, we cannot fully reconstruct these molecular layer structures. To obtain a more complete understanding, high-resolution interferometric imaging of AGB stars is needed. Nonetheless, considering the relatively consistent visibility data with spherical models, it's estimated that deviations from point symmetry arise from substructure at low flux levels for overall spherical intensity. For example, a single unresolved spot might be responsible for approximately 3% of the total flux and be separated by around 4 arcseconds (mas) from the center of the star. Several physical mechanisms could explain the asymmetric stellar surface structures observed in our targets, such as chaotic motion induced by pulsations in the interior leading to variations in the mass zone size on different sides of the star. An inhomogeneous or clumpy molecular environment within the extended atmosphere might play a significant role in non-LTE chemistry and may help clarify the formation of certain molecules like water in carbon-rich AGB stars. Additionally, this inhomogeneous environment could also be responsible for the observed clumping in the circumstellar environment at larger distances.
