The center of the active galaxy NGC 1097  
Astronomers have captured near-infrared images of the active galaxy NGC 1097 using the NACO instrument on the VLT. Located about 45 million light years away in the Fornax constellation, NGC 1097 is a bright, barred spiral galaxy seen from the front. It represents a moderate type of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), with radiation likely coming from matter (gas and stars) falling into a central black hole. NGC 1097 has a relatively faint center, indicating a low rate of matter infall. The new images reveal unprecedented detail around the nucleus, achieving a resolution of about 0.15 arcseconds, or roughly 30 light years across. Additionally, the newly released near-infrared images show over 300 star-forming areas, which is four times more than what was previously found using Hubble Space Telescope images. These star-forming regions appear as white spots in the accompanying image. This color-composite image displays a 5,500 light-year-wide area of NGC 1097's center, obtained with NACO. More than 300 star-forming regions, noted as white spots, are distributed along a ring of dust and gas, surrounding a bright center where the active galactic nucleus and its supermassive black hole are located. The image is formed by layering J-band (blue), H-band (green), and Ks-band (red) images. North is at the top and East is to the left.
