The center of the active galaxy NGC 1097  
Astronomers have captured near-infrared images of the active galaxy NGC 1097 using the NACO instrument on the VLT. Located about 45 million light years away in the Fornax constellation, NGC 1097 is a bright barred spiral galaxy viewed from the front. It is a moderate example of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), with emissions likely coming from matter (gas and stars) falling into a central black hole. NGC 1097 has a relatively faint nucleus, indicating a low rate of infall. The new images provide detailed views of the area around the nucleus, achieving a resolution of about 0.15 arcseconds, or roughly 30 light years. The recently released NACO near-infrared images show over 300 star-forming regions, which is four times more than previously identified from Hubble Space Telescope images. These "HII regions" appear as white spots in the accompanying image. A color-composite image displays the central area of the spiral galaxy, which is 5,500 light years wide, obtained with NACO on the VLT. More than 300 star-forming regions, visible as white spots, are located along a ring of dust and gas. At the center of this ring is a bright source where the active galactic nucleus and its supermassive black hole are found. The image combines J-(blue), H-(green), and Ks-band (red) images. North is at the top, and East is to the left.
