Future telescopes like the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) will investigate faint galaxies in the distant past to better understand their origins. To accurately measure these objects, researchers need a precise sky subtraction process. For instance, VLT's MOONS telescope aims to observe sources down to a magnitude of 25, while E-ELT's MOSAIC instrument can detect fainter features up to J/HAB magnitudes of 30 and 27 respectively.  However, the near infrared sky is quite bright, making it difficult to detect faint objects. Sky subtraction errors could obscure these faint features, necessitating accurate techniques for future observations. Slit spectrographs are frequently considered superior to fiber-fed spectrographs in terms of accuracy due to a few crucial factors. For example, fiber loss can be mitigated through careful design. Additionally, the accuracy of sky subtraction with slits is potentially easier than fiber. Despite advances in fiber technology, there are remaining limitations for achieving perfect sky subtraction for faint sources.  Two notable challenges include: (1) varying sky conditions between the target and sky measurement locations; and (2) variations in fiber response across all fibers. These issues might hinder accurate detection.
