Galaxy metallicity provides information about their history of star formation. Astronomers studied this by looking at gas emission lines that are excited by collisions. They focused on high-redshift galaxies, where measuring star metallicities is difficult, and used data from the VLT and LSD surveys to map gas metallicity. This helped show evidence for massive amounts of metal-poor gas being fed into active star formation in these galaxies. Even before the ALMA telescope begins offering greater sensitivity in submillimeter wavelengths, high-redshift galaxy gravitational lensing allowed researchers to identify large samples of galaxies that emit significant amounts of mm light.  These galaxies' gas properties can be studied using existing instruments. The dust properties of these submillimeter-selected galaxies were also discussed. A talk explored how polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) emissions in mid-infrared wavelengths can distinguish between AGN and starburst dominance, based on the short submillimeter wavelengths. This conclusion aligns with recent observations of FIR continuum emission from these same galaxies, observed using Herschel. These high-redshift, submillimeter starbursts were studied in the COSMOS field, which showed the existence of such objects as far out as z = 5.3. In the future, deeper ALMA surveys will allow astronomers to study obscured star formation in galaxies similar to our Milky Way, up to very high redshifts. Finally, a talk was given on how gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be used to probe the dust of distant galaxies where silicates likely make up the dominant form of dust.
