Luca Pasquini moderated the open discussion and noted that the complexity of the instrument, which has many modes and applications, means that users often have significant expertise. Thus, sharing experiences and tools with ESO staff and within the community is important for enhancing the data quality provided by ESO. The workshop revealed that many FLAMES users do not use the ESO pipeline software for data reduction; instead, a considerable number still rely on the Geneva Baseline Data Reduction Software, which was the only option at the start of FLAMES operations. ESO representatives shared that the ESO GIRAFFE pipeline software is now reliable and produces ready-to-use data, especially when operated interactively, and encouraged users to download it for their data reduction needs. Participants noted that the Geneva BLDRS has automated tools for extracting additional information from GIRAFFE spectra. ESO FLAMES IOT representatives acknowledged these comments and will explore solutions, such as enhancing specific algorithms or adapting ESO pipeline products to integrate with relevant data analysis tools. Several technical issues were also raised, including discrepancies in equivalent widths between FLAMES/UVES and FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectra, the need to quantify and report typical shifts in the cross-dispersion direction between science and morning flats in the User Manual, the importance of quantifying the accuracy of sky subtraction for the User Manual, and the requirement for a new set of solar spectra taken with the new CCD at all settings. These and other points raised during the Workshop will be addressed by the FLAMES IOT for follow-up. The findings will be shared through the FLAMES webpages and related documents. We thank all participants for their cooperation and positive attitude in sharing their results and experiences over the three-day workshop. For the ESO staff present, it was a rewarding experience to engage with a large segment of the FLAMES user community. Lastly, we extend our gratitude to the Director General Discretionary Fund programme for supporting this informal workshop.
