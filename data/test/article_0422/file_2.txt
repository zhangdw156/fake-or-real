The discovery of CEMP-no stars in two dwarf galaxies (Segue 1 and Boötes-I) provides strong evidence for these galaxies enriching themselves with material formed in the early universe. The abundance of carbon in these stars reflects the yield of early supernova explosions or massive stars. This research presents an opportunity to analyze the evolutionary history of interstellar gas that is highly enriched in carbon, while being poor in iron. A key observation is that the most iron-poor star known in Boötes-I is not enhanced with carbon. Carbon-enhanced and normal carbon stars coexist at similar low iron abundance within the same system. This directly demonstrates that carbon enhancement isn't necessary for low-iron gas to cool down and form low-mass stars. The study also finds that CEMP-no stars are absent in environments where iron abundance is higher than -2.5, suggesting a separate chemical enrichment process at these levels.  One must explain the observed absence of intermediate carbon and magnesium excesses at higher iron abundance because the highly carbon and magnesium enriched interstellar medium doesn't mix with "normal" enriched material to form more stars with moderate CEMP-no enrichment. This suggests that the cooling efficiency of the highly carbon-enriched material is very high, causing all of it to cool and form low-mass stars mixing with “normal” supernova ejecta before iron abundance reaches -3 dex.  These findings suggest two distinct channels of chemical enrichment in extremely low iron abundance environments. Our research currently provides no direct evolutionary track between the CEMP-no stars and carbon-normal stars with an iron abundance less than -3. This means there is no one-to-one relationship between iron abundance and the time since the first supernova explosions.
