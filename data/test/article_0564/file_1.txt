Researchers have gathered extensive data on Cepheid variables within the Milky Way galaxy for many years. This data has enabled astronomers to apply a near-infrared method to study the surface brightness of various stars in our galaxy. The first attempt to use this method on extragalactic Cepheids, a small sample was unsuccessful, so we decided to expand the sample size significantly. With new and precise light curves, obtained for both optical and near-infrared wavelengths, radial velocity curves became necessary. We were granted time with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher instrument, situated at the 3.6-meter telescope in La Silla over three observing seasons. During the first season, we observed 16 consecutive nights, covering short period stars; subsequent observing seasons were conducted under service mode with dedicated support from the La Silla staff. An example of a radial velocity curve is shown: specifically, it uses HV877 from the Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheid whose pulsation period is 45.2 days. Our data has excellent phase coverage due to careful planning in these last two observing seasons to address any gaps from the initial campaign. Carefully timed observations were made for the first time with this instrument, illustrating that this type of study requires precise scheduling; the instrument must be available not just over several long blocks but also in shorter, more frequent observation periods throughout the semester. Thanks to the flexibility of the La Silla support staff, our program was successful within three seasons. We obtained more than 450 data points with the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher on our 20 target stars.
