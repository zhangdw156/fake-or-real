NGC 6253 is the cluster with the highest metal content in our sample, making it a good candidate for examining how lithium depletion relates to metal content, which is expected in both standard and non-standard models. Specifically, this cluster's high metallicity suggests that we should see more lithium depletion for each mass. Figure 6 displays the typical relationship between lithium levels and effective temperature for the main sequence stars in NGC 6253, compared to the M 67 cluster. The figure shows that while lithium abundance generally decreases with lower temperature, two key points stand out: 1. Stars with temperatures above about 5,800 K in NGC 6253 show very little variation in lithium levels, much less than what is seen in M 67, while cooler stars show variations similar to M 67. This indicates that the observed variations and the temperature/mass at which they occur may be linked to specific features of the cluster, rather than its age. A detailed analysis of the complete lithium data will provide more insight into this matter. 2. Stars in the upper range of NGC 6253 do not exhibit greater lithium depletion than those in the upper range of M 67, which is approximately twice as metal-poor. This finding contradicts model predictions, suggesting that significant differences in metal content do not necessarily alter lithium depletion rates in the temperature range being studied. In summary, the preliminary results outlined indicate the effectiveness of our method. We have finished the radial velocity analysis for all sample clusters and are prepared to consistently determine cluster parameters using the synthetic colour-magnitude diagram technique we developed. Concurrently, we will finalize the UVES spectral analysis to assess the entire sample's chemical composition and perform lithium analysis using Giraffe spectra. We are also consistently analyzing the spectra of clusters observed within the GTO project. The final uniform dataset of cluster parameters and abundances will allow us to impose strict and reliable empirical limits on models of Galactic disc formation and evolution, as well as on the underlying processes in solar analogs during their main sequence phases. Additionally, we will explore several related scientific topics.
