NGC 6253 is the cluster with the highest metal content in our sample, making it a good candidate for examining how lithium depletion relates to metal content, which is suggested by both standard and non-standard models. Specifically, this cluster's high metallicity is expected to lead to greater lithium depletion for each mass. Figure 6 displays the typical relationship between lithium levels and effective temperature for the main sequence stars in NGC 6253, compared to the M 67 cluster. Alongside the usual decline in lithium abundance with lower temperature, two key points emerge from the figure: 1. For stars hotter than approximately 5,800 K, lithium abundances vary very little, much less than those for M 67 stars. However, cooler stars show similar variability to M 67. This pattern, observed in other older clusters, implies that the scatter and the temperature/mass where it's observed may relate to specific features of the cluster, rather than its age. A detailed analysis of the complete lithium dataset will provide more insight on this matter. 2. Stars in the upper range of NGC 6253 do not exhibit greater lithium depletion than those in the upper range of M 67, which is approximately twice as metal-poor. This indicates that, contrary to model predictions, significant differences in metal content do not necessarily alter lithium depletion rates in the considered temperature range. In conclusion, the preliminary findings showed the power of our methodology. We have completed the analysis of radial velocities for all selected clusters and are poised to determine their parameters uniformly using our developed synthetic colour-magnitude diagram technique. Additionally, we will finish analyzing UVES spectra to establish the chemical composition of the entire sample and assess Giraffe spectra for lithium levels. Observations from the GTO project above are being carefully evaluated as well. The completed, consistent dataset of cluster parameters and abundances will allow us to impose strict and strong empirical boundaries on models explaining the formation and evolution of the Galactic disc, along with the physical processes within solar analogues during main sequence phases. Several related research questions will also be explored.
