Evolved stars shed heavy elements into their surrounding galaxies through processes involving star winds or other types of outflows we don't fully understand yet because current models don't accurately predict these outflows' strength or frequency; it likely involves factors like pulsations or shocks within these stellar atmospheres that are covered by dusty material around them; the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) has unique capabilities for resolving these features; new techniques like three dimensional modeling combined with optical interferometry show that evolving star structures arent symmetrical as previously thought; future telescopes like PIONIER (with its combined use across multiple wavelengths), GRAVITY (which can study molecular winds), MATISSE (which focuses on oxygen carbon rich dust), ALMA (observing large scale structures using water hydroxyl masers), SPHERE(on VLT) offer promising ways forward for studying how much material they lose over time by observing them simultaneously across different wavelengths over short periods allowing us to see how this material moves within space over time . These studies could reveal connections between stellar surfaces where particles come from and where they go next . This detailed view would help us better understand why some star materials disappear faster than others .
