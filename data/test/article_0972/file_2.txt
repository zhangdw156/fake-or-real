The final session of the conference focused on fostering collaboration between radio and non-radio astronomers to get ready for challenging projects involving ALMA. They reviewed survey projects with significant participation from the Spanish community that would identify key targets for ALMA studies. Preliminary data was presented from a current survey and an upcoming survey that will examine the entire northern sky using 40 medium band filters. They summarized some survey plans relating to the 10.4-meter telescope, discussing the near-infrared spectroscopy of galaxies to be conducted by a project using that instrument, along with various cosmological surveys. As ALMA prepares to operate in the next few years, it was emphasized that different millimeter and submillimeter facilities need to start selecting their first science targets. They reviewed single-dish far-infrared to millimeter facilities, with a spotlight on those using interferometry, illustrating how the SubMillimeter Array (SMA) is gearing up for higher frequency activities in the ALMA era. They presented the sensitivity enhancements possible by integrating a phased array with numerous antennas operating at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths—like ALMA superconducting wire—in the VLBI array. They also identified several scenarios where ALMA and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) could work together effectively, offering complementary advantages in terms of frequency range and resolution. They detailed a design for a European imaging far-infrared spectrometer aimed at the 30–210 µm wavelength range, which could tackle important scientific questions and reinforce ALMA’s performance. Furthermore, they discussed how ALMA can complement several upcoming X-ray observatories to clarify the roles of star formation and supermassive black hole activity in the overall luminosity of AGN and bright infrared galaxies. The segment drew particular attention with an update on the Spanish telescope, which has recently begun operations, encouraging the community to explore its great potential for initiating programs supporting ALMA observations and for conducting follow-up studies on ALMA findings.
