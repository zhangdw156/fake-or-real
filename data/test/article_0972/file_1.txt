The last session of the conference focused on fostering collaboration between radio and non-radio astronomers to get ready for challenging projects with ALMA. They reviewed survey projects involving the Spanish community, which would yield the best targets for ALMA studies. Preliminary results from a survey and a future survey that will cover the entire northern sky using 40 medium band filters were shared. Summaries were given of some surveys proposed by the instrument at the 10.4 metre telescope, including near-infrared spectroscopy of galaxies and cosmological surveys. With ALMA set to begin operations in the next few years, it is essential for various millimetre and submillimetre facilities to prepare their initial science targets. They discussed single-dish far-infrared to millimetre facilities, with a particular focus on interferometric ones, showing how the SubMillimeter Array (SMA) is preparing for higher frequency studies during the ALMA era. They presented potential sensitivity improvements from using a phased array with many antennas working at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths, like ALMA, as part of the VLBI array. They also identified different scenarios in which ALMA and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) could enhance their scientific results as complementary instruments in frequency range and maximum resolution. The design concept of a European imaging far-infrared spectrometer for the mission covering the 30–210 µm band was summarized, emphasizing the scientific questions it could address that would complement ALMA's capabilities. The presentation included how ALMA and upcoming X-ray observatories could collaborate to better understand the contributions of star formation and supermassive black hole growth to the total luminosity of AGN and luminous infrared galaxies. The talk about the newly operational Spanish telescope generated special interest, highlighting the great opportunities it offers for preparing ALMA observation programs and enabling follow-up on ALMA discoveries.
