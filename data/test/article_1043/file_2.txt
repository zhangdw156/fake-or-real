NGAS is operated at three ESO locations. Each observatory has a cluster of three machines; one is used for data archiving, one is for disk management, and one is a backup. Data archiving from Paranal and Cambridge uses a standalone NGAS client and isn't a full NGAS setup. The system at Garching is more complex, featuring a complete primary archive and more archiving and disk management machines. Several external applications utilize NGAS for data archiving and requests, such as standard archive requests managed by the ESO request handler for data retrieval. Quality control processing occurs on a separate cluster that retrieves nearly all observed frames from NGAS using a direct client. Once processed, the Data Flow Operations team archives the QC results on NGAS, particularly the master calibration frames, and a new application for archiving quality control science products is under evaluation. The Advanced Data Products processing within the ESO Virtual Observatory Systems department is another significant user of the NGAS archive, requesting and processing large portions of the archive and subsequently archiving the findings. The secondary archive acts as a backup for the entire NGAS cluster using a Sony Petabyte tape library. A dedicated application interfaces NGAS with the commercial software ProTrieve, which manages the tape library, designed to accommodate the same data volume as the NGAS cluster, ensuring a scalable solution was purchased. All hardware for the primary and secondary archive, along with ProTrieve, has been sourced and is maintained through a contract with the Munich-based Kayser-Threde.
