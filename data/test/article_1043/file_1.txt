NGAS is operated at three ESO locations. Each observatory has a small cluster of three machines, of which only one is used for data archiving, another functions as a disk management unit, and the third is a backup. Archiving directly from Paranal and Cambridge uses a standalone NGAS archiving client rather than a complete NGAS installation. The Garching installation is more complex, featuring a full primary archive and several archiving and disk management units. Various external applications utilize NGAS for archiving or retrieving data, including standard archive requests handled by the ESO request handler. Quality control processing occurs on a separate cluster that retrieves nearly all observed frames from NGAS through a direct client. Once processed, QC scientists archive the results on NGAS, focusing on master calibration frames, and a new application for archiving and properly documenting QC science products is under testing. The Advanced Data Products processing within the ESO Virtual Observatory Systems department is another major user of the NGAS archive, requesting, processing, and archiving a large portion of the entire archive. The secondary archive serves as a backup for the NGAS cluster using a Sony Petabyte tape library. A specialized application has been created to link NGAS with ProTrieve, the software managing the tape library. The tape library must accommodate data comparable to the NGAS cluster, prompting careful selection of a scalable solution. All hardware for both the primary and secondary archives, along with ProTrieve, has been acquired and is maintained under a framework agreement with Munich-based company Kayser-Threde.
