Stereo-SCIDR is designed to measure how turbulent air affects telescopes' images by analyzing its intensity across different altitudes above ground level like it's looking down through fog or smoke! Developed by scientists from Durham University working together with ESO staff members , this project ran its first test run during 2016 using their own telescope equipment . This innovative tool will help future telescopes like EELT operate better by providing detailed information about air quality which could be used to make adjustments needed so they can see clearly! The team hopes that this information gathered over several months will improve our understanding about how air affects telescope observations . It uses special techniques based on studying pairs or "double" stars moving past each other which helps them detect small changes caused by turbulent air currents which then allows them to create maps showing how strong these currents might be . Their goal is not only to study existing data but also gather new insights into atmospheric conditions needed before they make major decisions regarding building future telescopes that need precise image quality even when theres lots going on around them! They plan on operating it continuously over several months so they can continue gathering valuable data until next year when they hope their findings will help guide future telescope designs .
