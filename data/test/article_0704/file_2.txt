After the review, the planned two-year consolidation phase for the final project has begun, as the review panel recommended. The panel noted that most components developed for OWL are still suitable for a smaller telescope, and we aim to create a basic reference design for what is now the European ELT project by the end of 2006. Our main objective is to define the most cost-effective ELT that can be built in a competitive timeframe and with acceptable risks. While the project is open to international collaboration, it is crucial to establish a baseline design that Europe can manage independently if no major partner is found. The process of defining the E-ELT has started under the guidance of mixed communicative chairpersons. Notably, of the more than ninety working group members reached out to on December 22, only two could not participate on such short notice due to urgent ESO-related duties, demonstrating strong community interest and commitment. The five ELT working groups were tasked with a two-month period of intense activity from January to February 2006 to provide initial input to the ESO Team in the form of 'toolboxes', which will compile current and projected capabilities related to the ELT in their specific areas and prioritize requirements. This phase has concluded successfully, with all contributions submitted on time and meeting the necessary standards. The former OWL team, which will soon be expanded and reorganized into the ELT project office, is now focused on creating the ELT reference group suggested by the OWL review panel, specifically a 'core' version that consolidates the reports from the five working groups into a recommendation for ESO. This 'core' ESE consists of the chairs and co-chairs of the ELT working groups, while the other group members will serve as ad-hoc experts for ESE at least until the end of 2006. The formal ESE will be established by the STC in the spring to assist and advise the ESO ELT project office through the upcoming complex iterations, aiming to effectively integrate Science, Adaptive Optics, Instruments, Telescope Design, and Site requirements to make foundational decisions and develop a coherent and impactful ELT project for Europe by the year's end. To ensure broader community engagement, the draft basic reference design will be presented and discussed at a workshop in mid-November 2006, allowing for final adjustments before submitting a definitive plan to the ESO Council in December 2006.
