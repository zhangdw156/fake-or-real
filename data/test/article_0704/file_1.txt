The two-year consolidation phase for the final project, as recommended by the review panel, has begun. Most elements developed for OWL are still applicable to a smaller telescope, and we aim to have a basic reference design for what is now the European ELT project by the end of 2006. Our main objective is to define the most cost-effective ELT that can be built competitively and with manageable risks. While we welcome international collaboration, we also need a baseline design that can be realized within Europe if no significant partners materialize. The E-ELT definition process has started, showing strong interest and dedication from the community; of the more than ninety working group members reached out to on December 22, only two could not participate due to urgent ESO-related tasks. In January and February 2006, the five ELT working groups conducted a two-month engagement aimed at providing initial input to the ESO Team in the form of 'toolboxes' that compile current and projected ELT capabilities in their particular areas, along with a preliminary prioritization of requirements. This initiative has concluded successfully, with all inputs received on time and of good quality. The former OWL team will soon evolve into the ELT project office and is primarily focused on creating the ‘core’ version of the ELT reference group that aligns with the OWL review panel’s recommendations, integrating reports from the five working groups into proposals for ESO. This ‘core’ group will consist of the chairs and co-chairs of the ELT working groups, while other working group members will serve as ad-hoc experts until at least the end of 2006. The official ESE will be established by STC in the spring to assist the ESO ELT project office during the complex iterative phases ahead, aiming to seamlessly integrate aspects like Science, Adaptive Optics, Instruments, Telescope Design, and Site considerations in order to define key selections and produce a unified and robust ELT project for Europe by year’s end. To promote broader community engagement, the draft basic reference design will be shared and discussed at a specialized workshop in mid-November 2006, allowing for a final review before presenting the definitive plan to the ESO Council in December 2006.
