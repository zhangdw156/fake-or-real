We focused on a group called "apparently isolated" stars as part our study using KMOS in an effort to understand how feedback from massive stars affects our galaxy's center (CMZ). These seemingly alone stars are important because there could be many more than we realize at play here - we need them included when analyzing feedback mechanisms driven by massive star activity in this region - and we don't know if they formed independently or were part larger groups before being ejected or disintegrating due to gravitational forces acting upon them within their original clusters
Our observation technique allows us to look for nearby companions which might be remnants left over from ancient clusters containing these initial "isolated" star populations - though no evidence has yet been found through this method
We've discovered several new, isolated high mass star candidates across different spectral types – some even exhibit characteristics consistent with known groupings like ArchesQuintuplets – highlighting potential connections between individual instances observed now versus previously theorized groupings
This research will rely on further analysis combining radial velocities measured through various techniques including proper motions derived from multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope observations – ultimately helping us determine how each individual star came about and improve our understanding overall about how stars form and cluster together around galactic centers like ours .
