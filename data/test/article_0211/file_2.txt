The 4MOST survey aims to understand how galaxies evolve by studying their star populations within our own Milky Way galaxy's disc bulge using high resolution spectroscopy (R 20k). This project focuses on obtaining detailed information about each star's age composition along with key characteristics like velocity elemental abundance â€“ even those not easily measured before now! By combining this data with complementary missions like Gaia TESS that measure other galactic properties like mass age for a larger sample size we can paint a more complete picture about how our own Galaxy formed its structure over time!
