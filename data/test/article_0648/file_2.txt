India's quest to explore the cosmos is reaching new heights, particularly as it pertains to understanding planets around faint, low-mass stars!  This exploration, fueled by Indian scientists and their innovative technologies, aims to unravel the secrets of these distant worlds for years to come.

The search is taking on a global dimension, with India joining forces with international collaborations like the Subaru telescope in Japan. Through its unique combination of instruments and cutting-edge techniques – specifically using the CRIRES instrument and the IRCS spectrograph on the Subaru Telescope – researchers are actively investigating the atmospheres of these stars. The goal? To precisely detect and characterize planets that orbit these stars, even those with masses similar to Earth!

These measurements are leading to crucial discoveries about planetary systems beyond our own. India's contribution has been substantial, allowing us to expand our knowledge of planet formation around nearby stars for a wider perspective on the universe. This program is nearing completion, showcasing their remarkable efforts in advancing planetary research, and lays a solid foundation for future exploration and further advancements.

Looking towards the future, Indian scientists are also pushing boundaries with the development of stable, advanced instruments for the NIR, aiming to achieve the same high precision as in the visible spectrum. The development of such technology is vital for expanding our capabilities in this area. 


This remarkable journey underscores India's commitment to scientific exploration and its dedication to unraveling the mysteries of the universe. By employing their innovative spirit and cutting-edge technologies, Indian scientists are playing a pivotal role in pushing the boundaries of space exploration and contributing significantly to the world’s understanding of planet formation.
