We continue searching for planets around low-mass stars until the end of program P85.  We have extended our program to include a two year addition to further observe 36 previously surveyed objects.  This will confirm potential planet candidates identified around these stars,  and allow us to examine more diverse planetary systems across all the stars we are targeting. The new measurements can identify planets down to potentially even terrestrial-mass planets within habitable zones of many targeted stars. We also plan to expand our survey to include 30 new targets for investigating gas giant companions using a shallow-wide approach.  In addition, we're utilizing the NIR spectrograph IRCS on the Subaru telescope to conduct a similar survey in the Northern Hemisphere utilizing a copy of our ammonia cell. While the IRCS has less spectral resolution and throughput compared to VLT + CRIRES, this will still enable us to study low-mass stars for gas giant planets.  This combination of projects provides comprehensive data about planets around nearby stars that includes both volume completeness within previously identified targets and future observational capabilities. We have shown it is possible to achieve comparable NIR radial velocity precision with our current method and see no reason why this level might not be reached in the future with a suitable new approach or instrument. Our current observations are limited by telluric lines, which likely would allow for better performance if removed.  If a new type of gas cell for the NIR was designed, featuring calibration lines that exist in interesting stars and whose Earthâ€™s atmosphere is free from these, this could significantly boost our results. However, such advancements seem unlikely. Instead, it's more probable that future improvements will require applying the HARPS concept of creating a highly stabilized instrument for NIR applications.  As new instruments for telescopes are under development with sizes 4-meters, 8-10 meters and even ELTs, we anticipate further progress in this field in the near to long term.
