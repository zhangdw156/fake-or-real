The software tutorial sessions were divided into two groups based on the participant's experience with radio/submillimeter interferometry. Advanced tutorials provided compact learning, lasting only one day, while novice tutorials continued for a third day to accommodate more time and deeper learning. Each group was trained in using both the Simulator Tools and the ALMA OT (Observatory Tool) through presentations, demonstrations, individual work guided by tutors. The novice tutorials included an extensive introduction to submillimeter concepts, spectral setup, and basic interferometry, while the advanced sessions focused on advancements from Cycle 0. A total of approximately 60 participants attended these workshops. Feedback for the Cycle 1 ALMA Community Days was generally positive, and several people expressed interest in a similar program for Cycle 2. The tutorial materials and presentations can be found electronically on the conference website.
