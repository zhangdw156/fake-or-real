GEBURTS up to late December's completion of major components like their structure where they house equipment like magic bands that help them see far away objects...the science magic starts there! The event is now moving into its working life where it can observe things better through different methods - this includes looking at our sun!
Here's what we know about who did what:
The teams have finished building most parts but there's still work underway - think finishing touches! They also plan future upgrades that involve both new structures like observation posts along with making improvements across existing ones! You can think about it like getting your house ready before moving all your stuff inside â€“ but much bigger!!
Funding: We know how much money went into building this incredible structure - close to 49 million back then is now equivalent to close enough dollars today! And they stayed within budget while doing so; not bad considering how much work went into it..
Let me know if you would prefer I elaborate further or provide additional information about any specific aspect covered here?
