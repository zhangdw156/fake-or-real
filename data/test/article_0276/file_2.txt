The construction projects related to ALMA's Array Operations Site (AOS) and its Operations Support Facility (OSF), completed their main phases by December of the year in question . However several tasks were still ongoing including finishing certain installations like security systems , completing specific building components such as offices , foundations etc., setting up utilities like power systems etc., along with testing various equipment components .
ALMA's commissioning process continues into its operational phase involving advanced observing techniques such as solar observations , participation within global VLBI experiments . The completion dates range from early year 'XX' where they planned to officially hand over their facilities .
Key milestones include:
Completed Infrastructure: Delivery or completion included buildings like technical buildings , offices , access roads etc., along with various other crucial components supporting both sites . These included numerous receiver cartridges , radiometers , power supplies assemblies that make up front end back end equipment needed for receiving signals from telescopes around Earth.. They also delivered specialized equipment like cryostats fiber management systems..
Antenna Delivery: An important aspect involved delivering almost all antennas used by ALMA under an agreement between ESA private organizations called "AEM Consortium". This delivery concluded successfully during early XX year when all warranties expired; these antennas continue operating without issues according to specifications..
Overall expenses remained low despite several challenges encountered during development stages; however it is important that lessons learned from this project are being applied towards future astronomical projects such as ELT program.. One notable instance involved transferring an experimental prototype telescope developed under ESA funding which had been previously tested near Socorro before being sent offsite where it replaced older technology used previously there
