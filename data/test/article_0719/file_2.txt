From April 2005 to September 2006, we studied 29 Seyfert galaxies using VISIR and successfully detected 25 of them. We applied a standard chop/nod method to effectively eliminate intense atmospheric background noise in the mid-infrared. To achieve optimal angular resolution, we selected VISIRâ€™s small field lens, which offers a pixel scale of 0.075 arcseconds and a viewing area of 19 by 19 arcseconds. This configuration allowed us to attain a typical resolution of 0.3 arcseconds, significantly enhancing our resolution compared to previous studies. Most observed galaxies appeared point-like, with extended emissions found in only three cases. NGC 5135, an example of extended emission, is shown in Figure 3. This combines VISIR and Hubble Space Telescope data, revealing that some sources of optical and mid-infrared emissions overlap while others do not. Where mid-infrared sources lack corresponding optical counterparts, this is likely indicative of early star formation, with young stars heating their vicinity without being luminous enough to disperse the surrounding dust.
