From April 2005 to September 2006, we studied 29 Seyfert galaxies using VISIR and successfully detected 25 of them. We applied a standard chop/nod method to eliminate the intense atmospheric background in the mid-infrared (MIR). To achieve the best angular resolution, we selected VISIRâ€™s small field objective, which has a pixel scale of 0.075 arcseconds and a field of view of 19 x 19 arcseconds. This configuration allowed us to achieve a typical resolution of 0.3 arcseconds, greatly enhancing the resolution compared to earlier research. Most of the objects we observed appear as point-like sources; only three exhibited extended emission surrounding the active galactic nuclei (AGN). One such example is NGC 5135, shown in Figure 3. This image combines VISIR and Hubble Space Telescope data, revealing that some optical and MIR emission sources overlap while others do not. Where MIR sources lack optical counterparts, it likely indicates the early stages of star formation as young stars heat their surroundings but are not yet strong enough to disperse the dust concealing them.
