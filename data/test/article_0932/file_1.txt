In addition to discussions about the scientific purposes of advanced wide-angle spectroscopic surveys, some presentations included actual proposals for equipping the VLT telescopes with wide-field high-multiplex spectrographs. One proposal documented an innovative 3 square degree, 12,000-slit spectrograph designed for VISTA, capable of surveying over 80,000 galaxies at a redshift of around 0.7 per night. Another talked about a concept for a 5 square degree fiber spectrograph with a multiplex factor of 5,000, currently under evaluation for one of the main focuses of the Large Binocular Telescope. This device might work with other 8-meter-class telescopes like the VLT, but would require modifications to its external components. Another pitch presented FIREBALL, set to utilize the OzPoz positioner of FLAMES to facilitate five spectrographs with interconnected hexabundle fibers from 50 adjustable Integral Field Units. An instrument named ULTRAPHOT was suggested to conduct studies on the variability of different sources by the FLAMES positioner বিএ feeds it up to 100 targets at a rapid CCD camera. Lastly, there was also mention of super-GIRAFFE, an additional potential upgrade to FLAMES/GIRAFFE pointed at increasing overall multiplex capabilities and throughput.
