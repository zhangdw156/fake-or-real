In addition to discussions about the scientific purposes of advanced wide-angle spectroscopic surveys, several presentations proposed actual instruments to equip the VLT telescopes with wide-field high-multiplex spectrographs. One presentation described a concept for a 3 square degree, 12,000-slit spectrograph for VISTA, capable of surveying over 80,000 galaxies at a redshift of 0.7 in one night. Another talked about a concept for a 5 square degree fiber spectrograph with a multiplex factor of 5,000, which is being evaluated for one of the main foci of the Large Binocular Telescope. This instrument could also be adapted for other 8-meter-class telescopes like the VLT but would require modifications to the upper part of the unit telescope. Another presentation introduced FIREBALL, which would use the OzPoz positioner of FLAMES to connect five spectrographs with hexabundle fibers from 50 deployable Integral Field Units. Additionally, an instrument called ULTRAPHOT was proposed to study the time variability of various sources using the FLAMES positioner to direct up to 100 objects to a very fast CCD camera. Finally, another presentation discussed super-GIRAFFE, a potential upgrade of FLAMES/GIRAFFE aimed at enhancing overall multiplexing and throughput.
