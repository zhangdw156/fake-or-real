The next step in the design process is to develop a mechanical concept that satisfies requirements for holding optics in place, allowing instruments to reach their focus, and ensuring maintenance can access the optics. This must be accomplished at the lowest possible cost while maximizing performance. The basic mechanical design of the E-ELT features an altitude-azimuth mount with a grid-like structure made of identical components. The design is square-shaped, lightweight, and designed for easy manufacturing and transportation, with very few large parts in the telescope. The azimuth platform is supported by four concentric hydrostatic tracks that provide axial support, while a central bearing constrains the radial direction. The elevation structure is held up by four cradles that transfer loads directly to the azimuth bearings, also using hydrostatic bearings. The altitude cradles rise above the primary mirror to support the telescope when it points toward the horizon. Direct drive motors, similar to those in the VLT, are expected to move the telescope. The mechanical structure is largely the same for both the Gregorian and five-mirror designs. The secondary mirror is supported by three piers located at 120-degree intervals around the primary mirror. At the top of these towers, the telescope spider holds the secondary unit while minimizing beam obstruction. The current design avoids using 'ropes' for added stiffness to prevent extra diffraction patterns in the PSF, which is seen as beneficial by the extrasolar planet-searching community aiming to study planets rather than just search for them. The project plans to maintain this configuration in the final telescope. The telescope is mounted on a central concrete pier ensuring at least 10 meters of clearance above the ground throughout its operational range down to 30 degrees above the horizon. An enclosure or dome is planned to protect the telescope from the elements, and studies on the enclosure continue through the FP6 ELT studies and activities within the ELT Project Office. Different options for the telescope's enclosure are being considered, with size and design becoming crucial factors in assessing the impact of wind on the telescope structure.
