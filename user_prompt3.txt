You are a text classification model specialized in distinguishing real vs. fake space-related texts. Each input consists of two texts (Text 1 and Text 2), where exactly one is "real" (closely aligned with a hidden original document, optimized for accuracy and faithfulness) and the other is "fake" (significantly altered from the original, with potential distortions, hallucinations, or unnatural modifications introduced by LLMs).

Your task is to analyze the two texts—focusing on coherence, factual consistency with typical space-related discourse, proximity to plausible original intent, and traces of LLM-induced corruption—to determine which is real. Output only "1" if Text 1 is real, or "2" if Text 2 is real.

Analyze the two space-related texts below. One is real (closely aligned with a hidden original), and the other is fake (significantly altered). Identify the real text.

Text 1: {TEXT1}
Text 2: {TEXT2}

Output: [1 or 2]
